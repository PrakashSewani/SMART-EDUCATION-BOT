The reproductive events in humans include\n\nformation of gametes (gametogenesis), i.e., sperms in males\n\nand ovum in females, transfer of sperms into the female\n\ngenital tract (insemination) and fusion of male and female\n\ngametes (fertilisation) leading to formation of zygote. This\n\nis followed by formation and development of blastocyst\n\nand its attachment to the uterine wall (implantation),\n\nembryonic development (gestation) and delivery of the\n\nbaby (parturition). You have learnt that these reproductive\n\nevents occur after puberty. There are remarkable\n\ndifferences between the reproductive events in the male\n\nand in the female, for example, sperm formation continues\n\neven in old men, but formation of ovum ceases in women\n\naround the age of fifty years. Let us examine the male and\n\nfemale reproductive systems in human.\n\n3.1 THE MALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM\n\nThe male reproductive system is located in the pelvis region\n\n(Figure 3.1a). It includes a pair of testes alongwith\n\naccessory ducts, glands and the external genitalia.\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\nHUMAN REPRODUCTION\n\n3.1 The Male Reproductive\n\nSystem\n\n3.2 The Female Reproductive\n\nSystem\n\n3.3 Gametogenesis\n\n3.4 Menstrual Cycle\n\n3.5 Fertilisation and\n\nImplantation\n\n3.6 Pregnancy and\n\nEmbryonic Development\n\n3.7 Parturition and Lactation\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nThe testes are situated outside the\n\nabdominal cavity within a pouch\n\ncalled scrotum. The scrotum helps\n\nin maintaining the low temperature\n\nof the testes (2–2.5o C lower than\n\nthe normal internal body\n\ntemperature) necessary for\n\nspermatogenesis. In adults, each\n\ntestis is oval in shape, with a length\n\nof about 4 to 5 cm and a width of\n\nabout 2 to 3 cm. The testis is\n\ncovered by a dense covering. Each\n\ntestis has about 250 compartments\n\ncalled testicular lobules\n\n(Figure 3.1b).\n\nEach lobule contains one to\n\nthree highly coiled seminiferous\n\ntubules in which sperms are\n\nproduced. Each seminiferous tubule\n\nis lined on its inside by two types\n\nof cells called male germ cells\n\n(spermatogonia) and Sertoli cells\n\n(Figure 3.2 ). The male germ cells\n\nundergo meiotic divisions finally\n\nleading to sperm formation, while\n\nSertoli cells provide nutrition to the\n\ngerm cells. The regions outside the\n\nseminiferous tubules called\n\ninterstitial spaces, contain small\n\nblood vessels and interstitial cells\n\nor Leydig cells (Figure 3.2). Leydig\n\ncells synthesise and secrete\n\ntesticular hormones called\n\nandrogens. Other  immunologically\n\ncompetent cells are also present.\n\nThe male sex accessory ducts include rete testis, vasa efferentia,\n\nepididymis and vas deferens (Figure 3.1b). The seminiferous tubules of\n\nthe testis open into the vasa efferentia through rete testis. The vasa efferentia\n\nleave the testis and open into epididymis located along the posterior surface\n\nof each testis. The epididymis leads to vas deferens that ascends to the\n\nabdomen and loops over the urinary bladder. It receives a duct from seminal\n\nvesicle and opens into urethra as the ejaculatory duct (Figure 3.1a). These\n\nducts store and transport the sperms from the testis to the outside through\n\nurethra. The urethra originates from the urinary bladder and extends\n\nthrough the penis to its external opening called urethral meatus.\n\nFigure 3.1(a) Diagrammatic sectional view of male pelvis\nshowing reproductive system\n\nFigure 3.1(b) Diagrammatic view of male reproductive system\n(part of testis is open to show inner details)\n\n43\n\nHUMAN REPRODUCTION\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n44\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nThe penis is the male external genitalia (Figure 3.1a, b). It is made up\n\nof special tissue that helps in erection of the penis to facilitate insemination.\n\nThe enlarged end of penis called the glans penis is covered by a loose fold\n\nof skin called foreskin.\n\nThe male accessory glands (Figure 3.1a, b) include paired seminal\n\nvesicles, a prostate and paired bulbourethral glands. Secretions of these\n\nglands constitute the seminal plasma which is rich in fructose, calcium\n\nand certain enzymes. The secretions of bulbourethral glands also helps\n\nin the lubrication of the penis.\n\n3.2 THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM\n\nThe female reproductive system consists of a pair of ovaries alongwith a pair\n\nof oviducts, uterus, cervix, vagina and the external genitalia located in\n\npelvic region (Figure 3.3a). These parts of the system alongwith a pair of the\n\nmammary glands are integrated structurally and functionally to support\n\nthe processes of ovulation, fertilisation, pregnancy, birth and child care.\n\nOvaries are the primary female sex organs that produce the female\n\ngamete (ovum) and several steroid hormones (ovarian hormones).\n\nThe ovaries are located one on each side of the lower abdomen\n\n(Figure 3.3b). Each ovary is about 2 to 4 cm in length and is connected to\n\nthe pelvic wall and uterus by ligaments. Each ovary is covered by a thin\n\nepithelium which encloses the ovarian stroma. The stroma is divided into\n\ntwo zones – a peripheral cortex and an inner medulla.\n\nFigure 3.2 Diagrammatic sectional view of seminiferous tubule\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n45\n\nHUMAN REPRODUCTION\n\nThe oviducts (fallopian tubes), uterus and vagina constitute the female\n\naccessory ducts. Each fallopian tube is about 10-12 cm long and extends\n\nfrom the periphery of each ovary to the uterus (Figure 3.3b), the part closer\n\nto the ovary is the funnel-shaped infundibulum. The edges of the\n\ninfundibulum possess finger-like projections called fimbriae, which help in\n\ncollection of the ovum after ovulation. The infundibulum leads to a wider\n\nFigure 3.3 (b) Diagrammatic sectional view of the female reproductive system\n\nFigure 3.3 (a) Diagrammatic sectional view of female pelvis showing\nreproductive system\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n46\n\nBIOLOGY\n\npart of the oviduct called ampulla. The last part of the oviduct, isthmus has\n\na narrow lumen and it joins the uterus.\n\nThe uterus is single and it is also called womb. The shape of the uterus\n\nis like an inverted pear. It is supported by ligaments attached to the pelvic\n\nwall. The uterus opens into vagina through a narrow cervix. The cavity of\n\nthe cervix is called cervical canal (Figure 3.3b) which alongwith vagina\n\nforms the birth canal. The wall of the uterus has three layers of tissue. The\n\nexternal thin membranous perimetrium, middle thick layer of smooth\n\nmuscle, myometrium and inner glandular layer called endometrium that\n\nlines the uterine cavity. The endometrium undergoes cyclical changes during\n\nmenstrual cycle while the myometrium exhibits strong contraction during\n\ndelivery of the baby.\n\nThe female external genitalia include mons pubis, labia majora, labia\n\nminora, hymen and clitoris (Figure 3.3a). Mons pubis is a cushion of fatty\n\ntissue covered by skin and pubic hair. The labia majora are fleshy folds of\n\ntissue, which extend down from the mons pubis and surround the vaginal\n\nopening. The labia minora are paired folds of tissue under the labia majora.\n\nThe opening of the vagina is often covered partially by a membrane called\n\nhymen. The clitoris is a tiny finger-like structure which lies at the upper\n\njunction of the two labia minora above the urethral opening.  The hymen is\n\noften torn during the first coitus (intercourse). However, it can also be broken\n\nby a sudden fall or jolt, insertion of a vaginal tampon, active participation\n\nin some sports like horseback riding, cycling, etc. In some women the hymen\n\npersists even after coitus. In fact, the presence or absence of hymen is not\n\na reliable indicator of virginity or sexual experience.\n\nFigure 3.4 A diagrammatic sectional view of Mammary gland\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n47\n\nHUMAN REPRODUCTION\n\nA functional mammary gland is characteristic of all female mammals.\n\nThe mammary glands are paired structures (breasts) that contain\n\nglandular tissue and variable amount of fat. The glandular tissue of each\n\nbreast is divided into 15-20 mammary lobes containing clusters of cells\n\ncalled alveoli (Figure 3.4). The cells of alveoli secrete milk, which is stored\n\nin the cavities (lumens) of alveoli. The alveoli open into mammary tubules.\n\nThe tubules of each lobe join to form a mammary duct. Several mammary\n\nducts join to form a wider mammary ampulla which is connected to\n\nlactiferous duct through which milk is sucked out.\n\n3.3 GAMETOGENESIS\n\nThe primary sex organs – the testis in the males and the ovaries in the\n\nfemales – produce gametes, i.e, sperms and ovum, respectively, by the\n\nprocess called gametogenesis. In testis, the immature male germ cells\n\n(spermatogonia) produce sperms by spermatogenesis that begins at\n\npuberty.  The spermatogonia (sing. spermatogonium) present on the\n\ninside wall of seminiferous tubules multiply by mitotic division and\n\nincrease in numbers. Each spermatogonium is diploid and contains 46\n\nchromosomes. Some of the spermatogonia called primary\n\nspermatocytes periodically undergo meiosis. A primary spermatocyte\n\ncompletes the first meiotic division (reduction division) leading to\n\nformation of two equal,  haploid cells called\n\nsecondary spermatocytes, which have only\n\n23 chromosomes each. The secondary\n\nspermatocytes undergo the second meiotic\n\ndivision to produce four equal, haploid\n\nspermatids (Figure 3.5). What would be the\n\nnumber of chromosome in the spermatids?\n\nThe spermatids are transformed into\n\nspermatozoa (sperms) by the process called\n\nspermiogenesis. After spermiogenesis,\n\nsperm heads become embedded in the\n\nSertoli cells, and are finally released from\n\nthe seminiferous tubules by the process\n\ncalled spermiation.\n\nSpermatogenesis starts at the age of\n\npuberty due to significant increase in the\n\nsecretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone\n\n(GnRH). This, if you recall, is a hypothalamic hormone. The increased\n\nlevels of GnRH then acts at the anterior pituitary gland and stimulates\n\nsecretion of two gonadotropins – luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle\n\nstimulating hormone (FSH).  LH acts at the Leydig cells and stimulates\n\nsynthesis and secretion of androgens. Androgens, in turn, stimulate the\n\nprocess of spermatogenesis. FSH acts on the Sertoli cells and stimulates\n\nFigure 3.5 Diagrammatic sectional view of a\nseminiferous tubule (enlarged)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n48\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nsecretion of some factors which help in the\n\nprocess of spermiogenesis.\n\nLet us examine the structure of a sperm. It\n\nis a microscopic structure composed of a head,\n\nneck, a middle piece and a tail (Figure 3.6). A\n\nplasma membrane envelops the whole body of\n\nsperm. The sperm head contains an elongated\n\nhaploid nucleus, the anterior portion of which\n\nis covered by a cap-like structure, acrosome.\n\nThe acrosome is filled with enzymes that help\n\nfertilisation of the ovum. The middle piece\n\npossesses numerous mitochondria, which\n\nproduce energy for the movement of  tail that\n\nfacilitate sperm motility essential for fertilisation.\n\nThe human male ejaculates about 200 to 300\n\nmillion sperms during a coitus of which, for\n\nnormal fertility, at least 60 per cent sperms\n\nmust have normal shape and size and at least\n\n40 per cent of them must show vigorous\n\nmotility.\n\nSperms released from the seminiferous\n\ntubules, are transported by the accessory\n\nducts. Secretions of epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicle and\n\nprostate are essential for maturation and motility of sperms. The seminal\n\nplasma along with the sperms constitute the semen. The functions of\n\nmale sex accessory ducts and glands are maintained by the testicular\n\nhormones (androgens).\n\nThe process of formation of a mature female gamete is called oogenesis\n\nwhich is markedly different from spermatogenesis. Oogenesis is initiated\n\nduring the embryonic development stage when a couple of million gamete\n\nmother cells (oogonia) are formed within each fetal ovary; no more oogonia\n\nare formed and added after birth. These cells start division and enter into\n\nprophase-I of the meiotic division and get temporarily arrested at that stage,\n\ncalled primary oocytes. Each primary oocyte then gets surrounded by a\n\nlayer of granulosa cells and is called the primary follicle (Figure 3.7). A\n\nlarge number of these follicles degenerate during the phase from birth to\n\npuberty. Therefore, at puberty only 60,000-80,000 primary follicles are\n\nleft in each ovary. The primary follicles get surrounded by more layers of\n\ngranulosa cells and a new theca and are called secondary follicles.\n\nThe secondary follicle soon transforms into a tertiary follicle which is\n\ncharacterised by a fluid filled cavity called antrum. The theca layer is\n\norganised into an inner theca interna and an outer theca externa. It is\n\nimportant to draw your attention that it is at this stage that the primary\n\noocyte within the tertiary follicle grows in size and completes its first meiotic\n\ndivision. It is an unequal division resulting in the formation of a large\n\nhaploid secondary oocyte and a tiny first polar body (Figure 3.8b). The\n\nFigure 3.6 Structure of a sperm\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n49\n\nHUMAN REPRODUCTION\n\nsecondary oocyte retains bulk of the\n\nnutrient rich cytoplasm of the primary\n\noocyte. Can you think of any advantage\n\nfor this? Does the first polar body born\n\nout of first meiotic division divide further\n\nor degenerate?  At present we are not\n\nvery certain about this. The tertiary\n\nfollicle further changes into the mature\n\nfollicle or Graafian follicle (Figure 3.7).\n\nThe secondary oocyte forms a new\n\nmembrane called zona pellucida\n\nsurrounding it. The Graafian follicle now\n\nruptures to release the secondary oocyte\n\n(ovum) from the ovary by the\n\nprocess called ovulation. Can you\n\nidentify major differences between\n\nspermatogenesis and oogenesis?  A diagrammatic representation of\n\nspermatogenesis and oogenesis is given below (Figure 3.8).\n\nFigure 3.7 Diagrammatic Section view of ovary\n\nFigure 3.8 Schematic representation of (a) Spermatogenesis; (b) Oogenesis\n\n(a) (b)\n\n3.4 MENSTRUAL CYCLE\n\nThe reproductive cycle in the female primates (e.g. monkeys, apes and\n\nhuman beings) is called menstrual cycle. The first menstruation begins\n\nat puberty and is called menarche. In human females, menstruation\n\nis repeated at an average interval of about 28/29 days, and the cycle of\n\nevents starting from one menstruation till the next one is called the\n\nmenstrual cycle. One ovum is released (ovulation) during the middle\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n50\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nFigure 3.9 Diagrammatic presentation of various events during a menstrual cycle\n\nof each menstrual cycle. The major events of the menstrual cycle are\n\nshown in Figure 3.9. The cycle starts with the menstrual phase, when\n\nmenstrual flow occurs and it lasts for 3-5 days. The menstrual flow\n\nresults due to breakdown of endometrial lining of the uterus and its\n\nblood vessels which forms liquid that comes out through vagina.\n\nMenstruation only occurs if the released ovum is not fertilised. Lack of\n\nmenstruation may be indicative of pregnancy. However, it may also be\n\ncaused due to some other underlying causes like stress, poor health etc.\n\nThe menstrual phase is followed by the follicular phase. During\n\nthis phase, the primary follicles in the ovary grow to become a\n\nfully mature Graafian follicle and simultaneously the endometrium\n\nof uterus regenerates through proliferation. These changes in the\n\novary and the uterus are induced by changes in the levels of\n\npituitary and ovarian hormones (Figure 3.9). The secretion of\n\n\n\n51\n\nHUMAN REPRODUCTION\n\ngonadotropins (LH and FSH) increases gradually during the follicular\n\nphase, and stimulates follicular development as well as secretion of\n\nestrogens by the growing follicles. Both LH and FSH attain a peak level\n\nin the middle of cycle (about 14th day). Rapid secretion of LH leading to\n\nits maximum level during the mid-cycle called LH surge induces rupture\n\nof Graafian follicle and thereby the release of ovum (ovulation). The\n\novulation (ovulatory phase) is followed by the luteal phase during which\n\nthe remaining parts of the Graafian follicle transform as the corpus\n\nluteum (Figure 3.9). The corpus luteum secretes large amounts of\n\nprogesterone which is essential for maintenance of the endometrium.\n\nSuch an endometrium is necessary for implantation of the fertilised\n\novum and other events of pregnancy. During pregnancy all events of\n\nthe menstrual cycle stop and there is no menstruation.  In the absence\n\nof fertilisation, the corpus luteum degenerates. This causes disintegration\n\nof the endometrium leading to menstruation, marking a new cycle.  In\n\nhuman beings, menstrual cycles ceases around 50 years of age; that is\n\ntermed as menopause. Cyclic menstruation is an indicator of normal\n\nreproductive phase and extends between menarche and menopause.\n\n3.5 FERTILISATION AND IMPLANTATION\n\nDuring copulation (coitus) semen is released by the penis into the vagina\n\n(insemination). The motile sperms swim rapidly, pass through the cervix,\n\nenter into the uterus and finally reach the ampullary region of the\n\nfallopian tube (Figure 3.11b). The ovum released by the ovary is also\n\ntransported to the ampullary region\n\nwhere fertilisation takes place.\n\nFertilisation can only occur if the\n\novum and sperms are transported\n\nsimultaneously to the ampullary\n\nregion.  This is the reason why not all\n\ncopulations lead to fertilisation and\n\npregnancy.\n\nThe process of fusion of a sperm\n\nwith an ovum is called fertilisation.\n\nDuring fertilisation, a sperm comes in\n\ncontact with the zona pellucida layer\n\nof the ovum  (Figure 3.10) and induces\n\nchanges in the membrane  that block\n\nthe entry of additional sperms.  Thus,\n\nit ensures that only one sperm can\n\nfertilise an ovum.  The secretions of the\n\nacrosome help the sperm enter into the\n\ncytoplasm of the ovum through the\n\nzona pellucida and the plasma\nFigure 3.10 Ovum surrounded by few sperms\n\n51\n\nMaintenance of\nhygiene and sanitation\nduring menstruation is\nvery important. Take\nbath and clean yourself\nregulary. Use sanitary\nnapkins or clean\nhomemade pads.\nChange sanitary\nnapkins or homemade\npads after every 4–5 hrs\nas per the requirement.\nDispose of the used\nsanitary napkins\nproperly wrapping it\nwith a used paper. Do\nnot throw the used\nnapkins in the\ndrainpipe of toilets or\nin the open area. After\nhandling the napkin\nwash hands with soap.\n\nMenstrual  Hygiene\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n52\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nFigure 3.11 Transport of ovum, fertilisation and passage of growing embryo through fallopian tube\n\nmembrane. This induces the completion of the meiotic division of the\n\nsecondary oocyte. The second meiotic division is also unequal and results\n\nin the formation of a second polar body and a haploid ovum (ootid). Soon\n\nthe haploid nucleus of the sperms and that of the ovum fuse together to\n\nform a diploid zygote.  How many chromosomes will be there in the zygote?\n\nOne has to remember that the sex of the baby has been decided at this\n\nstage itself. Let us see how? As you know the chromosome pattern in the\n\nhuman female is XX and that in the male is XY. Therefore, all the haploid\n\ngametes (ova) produced by the female have the sex chromosome X whereas\n\nin the male gametes (sperms) the sex chromosome could be either X or Y,\n\nhence, 50 per cent of sperms carry the X chromosome while the other 50 per\n\ncent carry the Y. After fusion of the male and female gametes the zygote\n\nwould carry either XX or XY depending on whether the sperm carrying X\n\nor Y fertilised the ovum. The zygote carrying XX would develop into a female\n\nbaby and XY would form a male (you will learn more about the chromosomal\n\npatterns in Chapter 5). That is why, scientifically it is correct to say that the\n\nsex of the baby is determined by the father and not by the mother!\n\nThe mitotic division  starts as the zygote moves through the isthmus\n\nof the oviduct called cleavage towards the uterus (Figure 3.11) and forms\n\n2, 4, 8, 16 daughter cells called blastomeres. The embryo with 8 to 16\n\n\n\n53\n\nHUMAN REPRODUCTION\n\nblastomeres is called a morula (Figure 3.11e). The morula continues to\n\ndivide and transforms into blastocyst (Figure 3.11g) as it moves further\n\ninto the uterus. The blastomeres in the blastocyst are arranged into an\n\nouter layer called trophoblast and an inner group of cells attached to\n\ntrophoblast called the inner cell mass. The trophoblast layer then gets\n\nattached to the endometrium and the inner cell mass gets differentiated\n\nas the embryo. After attachment, the uterine cells divide rapidly and covers\n\nthe blastocyst. As a result, the blastocyst becomes embedded in the\n\nendometrium of the uterus (Figure 3.11h). This is called implantation\n\nand it leads to pregnancy.\n\n3.6 PREGNANCY AND EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT\n\nAfter implantation, finger-like projections appear on the trophoblast called\n\nchorionic villi which are surrounded by the uterine tissue and maternal\n\nblood. The chorionic villi and uterine tissue become interdigitated with\n\neach other and jointly form a structural and functional unit between\n\ndeveloping embryo (foetus) and maternal body called placenta (Figure 3.12).\n\nThe placenta facilitate the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the\n\nembryo and also removal of carbon dioxide and excretory/waste materials\n\nproduced by the embryo. The placenta is connected to the embryo through\n\nan umbilical cord which helps in the transport of substances to and from\n\nthe embryo. Placenta also acts as an endocrine tissue and produces\n\nseveral hormones like human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), human\n\nplacental lactogen (hPL), estrogens, progestogens, etc. In the later\n\nphase of pregnancy, a hormone called relaxin is also secreted by\n\nthe ovary. Let us remember\n\nthat hCG, hPL and relaxin\n\nare produced in women\n\nonly during pregnancy. In\n\naddition, during pregnancy\n\nthe levels of other hormones\n\nlike estrogens, progestogens,\n\ncortisol, prolactin, thyroxine,\n\netc., are increased several-\n\nfolds in the maternal blood.\n\nIncreased production of these\n\nhormones is essential for\n\nsupporting the fetal growth,\n\nmetabolic changes in the\n\nmother and maintenance of\n\npregnancy.\n\nImmediately after\n\nimplantation, the inner cell\n\nmass (embryo) differentiates Figure 3.12 The human foetus within the uterus\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n54\n\nBIOLOGY\n\ninto an outer layer called ectoderm and an inner layer called endoderm. A\n\nmesoderm soon appears between the ectoderm and the endoderm. These\n\nthree layers give rise to all tissues (organs) in adults. It needs to be mentioned\n\nhere that the inner cell mass contains certain cells called stem cells which\n\nhave the potency to give rise to all the tissues and organs.\n\nWhat are the major features of embryonic development at various\n\nmonths of pregnancy?  The human pregnancy lasts 9 months. Do you\n\nknow for  how many months pregnancy last in dogs, elephants, cats?\n\nFind out. In human beings, after one month of pregnancy, the embryo’s\n\nheart is formed. The first sign of growing foetus may be noticed by listening\n\nto the  heart sound carefully through the stethoscope. By the end of the\n\nsecond month of pregnancy, the foetus develops limbs and digits. By the\n\nend of 12 weeks (first trimester), most of the major organ systems are\n\nformed, for example, the limbs and external genital organs are well-\n\ndeveloped. The first movements of the foetus and appearance of hair on\n\nthe head are usually observed during the fifth month. By the end of about\n\n24 weeks (end of second trimester), the body is covered with fine hair,\n\neye-lids separate, and eyelashes are formed.  By the end of nine months\n\nof pregnancy, the foetus is fully developed and is ready for delivery.\n\n3.7 PARTURITION AND LACTATION\n\nThe average duration of human pregnancy is about 9 months\n\nwhich is called the gestation period. Vigorous contraction of the uterus at\n\nthe end of pregnancy causes expulsion/delivery of the foetus. This process\n\nof delivery of the foetus (childbirth) is called parturition. Parturition is\n\ninduced by a complex neuroendocrine mechanism. The signals for\n\nparturition originate from the fully developed foetus and the placenta\n\nwhich induce mild uterine contractions called foetal ejection reflex. This\n\ntriggers release of oxytocin from the maternal pituitary. Oxytocin acts on\n\nthe uterine muscle and causes stronger uterine contractions, which in\n\nturn stimulates further secretion of oxytocin. The stimulatory reflex between\n\nthe uterine contraction and oxytocin secretion continues resulting in\n\nstronger and stronger contractions. This leads to expulsion of the baby\n\nout of the uterus through the birth canal – parturition. Soon after the\n\ninfant is delivered, the placenta is also expelled out of the uterus. What do\n\nyou think the doctors inject to induce delivery?\n\nThe mammary glands of the female undergo differentiation during\n\npregnancy and starts producing milk towards the end of pregnancy by\n\nthe process called lactation. This helps the mother in feeding the new-\n\nborn. The milk produced during the initial few days of lactation is called\n\ncolostrum which contains several antibodies absolutely essential to\n\ndevelop resistance for the new-born babies. Breast-feeding during the\n\ninitial period of infant growth is recommended by doctors for bringing up\n\na healthy baby.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n55\n\nHUMAN REPRODUCTION\n\nSUMMARY\n\nHumans are sexually reproducing and viviparous. The male\nreproductive system is composed of a pair of testes, the male sex\naccessory ducts and the accessory glands and external genitalia. Each\ntestis has about 250 compartments called testicular lobules, and each\nlobule contains one to three highly coiled seminiferous tubules. Each\nseminiferous tubule is lined inside by spermatogonia and Sertoli cells.\nThe spermatogonia undergo meiotic divisions leading to sperm formation,\nwhile Sertoli cells provide nutrition to the dividing germ cells. The Leydig\ncells outside the seminiferous tubules, synthesise and secrete testicular\nhormones called androgens. The male external genitalia is called penis.\n\nThe female reproductive system consists of a pair of ovaries, a pair\nof oviducts, a uterus, a vagina, external genitalia, and a pair of\nmammary glands. The ovaries produce the female gamete (ovum) and\nsome steroid hormones (ovarian hormones). Ovarian follicles in different\nstages of development are embedded in the stroma. The oviducts, uterus\nand vagina are female accessory ducts. The uterus has three layers\nnamely perimetrium, myometrium and endometrium. The female\nexternal genitalia includes mons pubis, labia majora, labia minora,\nhymen and clitoris. The mammary glands are one of the female\nsecondary sexual characteristics.\n\nSpermatogenesis results in the formation of sperms that are\ntransported by the male sex accessory ducts. A normal human sperm\nis composed of a head, neck, a middle piece and tail. The process of\nformation of mature female gametes is called oogenesis. The\nreproductive cycle of female primates is called menstrual cycle.\nMenstrual cycle starts only after attaining sexual maturation (puberty).\nDuring ovulation only one ovum is released per menstrual cycle. The\ncyclical changes in the ovary and the uterus during menstrual cycle\nare induced by changes in the levels of pituitary and ovarian hormones.\nAfter coitus, sperms are transported to the junction of the isthmus and\nampulla, where the sperm fertilises the ovum leading to formation of a\ndiploid zygote. The presence of X or Y chromosome in the sperm\ndetermines the sex of the embryo. The zygote undergoes repeated mitotic\ndivision to form a blastocyst, which is implanted in the uterus resulting\nin pregnancy. After nine months of pregnancy, the fully developed  foetus\nis ready for delivery. The process of childbirth is called parturition which\nis induced by a complex neuroendocrine mechanism involving cortisol,\nestrogens and oxytocin. Mammary glands differentiate during pregnancy\nand secrete milk after child-birth. The new-born baby is fed milk by the\nmother (lactation) during the initial few months of growth.\n\nEXERCISES\n1.
