The\n\nmyriads of flowers that we enjoy gazing at, the scents and\n\nthe perfumes that we swoon over, the rich colours that\n\nattract us, are all there as an aid to sexual reproduction.\n\nFlowers do not exist only for us to be used for our own\n\nselfishness. All flowering plants show sexual reproduction.\n\nA look at the diversity of structures of the inflorescences,\n\nflowers and floral parts, shows an amazing range of\n\nadaptations to ensure formation of the end products of\n\nsexual reproduction, the fruits and seeds.  In this chapter,\n\nlet us understand the morphology, structure and the\n\nprocesses of sexual reproduction in flowering plants\n\n(angiosperms).\n\n2.1 FLOWER – A FASCINATING ORGAN OF\nANGIOSPERMS\n\nHuman beings have had an intimate relationship with\n\nflowers since time immemorial.  Flowers are objects of\n\naesthetic, ornamental, social, religious and cultural value\n\n– they have always been used as symbols for conveying\n\nimportant human feelings such as love, affection,\n\nhappiness, grief, mourning, etc.  List at least five flowers\n\nof ornamental value that are commonly cultivated at\n\n2.1 Flower – A Fascinating\n\nOrgan of Angiosperms\n\n2.2 Pre-fertilisation : Structures\n\nand Events\n\n2.3 Double Fertilisation\n\n2.4 Post-fertilisation: Structures\n\nand Events\n\n2.5 Apomixis and\n\nPolyembryony\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nSEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN\n\nFLOWERING PLANTS\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n20\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nhomes and in gardens. Find out the names of five more flowers that are\n\nused in social and cultural celebrations in your family.  Have you heard\n\nof floriculture – what does it refer to?\n\nTo a biologist, flowers are morphological and embryological marvels\n\nand the sites of sexual reproduction.  In class XI, you have read the various\n\nparts of a flower.  Figure 2.1 will help you recall the parts of a typical\n\nflower. Can you name the two parts in a flower in which the two most\n\nimportant units of sexual reproduction develop?\n\n2.2 PRE-FERTILISATION: STRUCTURES AND EVENTS\n\nMuch before the actual flower is seen on a plant, the decision that the plant\n\nis going to flower has taken place. Several hormonal and structural changes\n\nare initiated which lead to the differentiation and further development of\n\nthe floral primordium. Inflorescences are formed which bear the floral buds\n\nand then the flowers. In the flower the male and female reproductive\n\nstructures, the androecium and the gynoecium differentiate and develop.\n\nYou would recollect that the androecium consists of a whorl of stamens\n\nrepresenting the male reproductive organ and the gynoecium represents\n\nthe female reproductive organ.\n\nFigure 2.1 A diagrammatic representation of L.S. of a flower\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n21\n\nHUMAN REPRODUCTIONSEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN FLOWERING PLANTS\n\n2.2.1 Stamen, Microsporangium and Pollen Grain\n\nFigure 2.2a shows the two parts of a typical stamen – the long and slender\n\nstalk called the filament, and the terminal generally bilobed structure\n\ncalled the anther. The proximal end of the filament\n\nis attached to the thalamus or the petal of the flower.\n\nThe number and length of stamens are variable in\n\nflowers of different species.  If you were to collect a\n\nstamen each from ten flowers (each from different\n\nspecies) and arrange them on a slide, you would\n\nbe able to appreciate the large variation in size seen\n\nin nature.  Careful observation of each stamen\n\nunder a dissecting microscope and making neat\n\ndiagrams would elucidate the range in shape and\n\nattachment of anthers in different flowers.\n\nA typical angiosperm anther is bilobed with\n\neach lobe having two theca, i.e., they are dithecous\n\n(Figure 2.2 b). Often a longitudinal groove runs\n\nlengthwise separating the theca. Let us\n\nunderstand the various types of tissues and their\n\norganisation in the transverse section of an anther\n\n(Figure 2.3 a). The bilobed nature of an anther is\n\nvery distinct in the transverse section of the anther.\n\nThe anther is a four-sided (tetragonal) structure\n\nconsisting of four microsporangia located at the\n\ncorners, two in each lobe.\n\nThe microsporangia develop further and\n\nbecome pollen sacs.  They extend longitudinally\n\nall through the length of an anther and are packed\n\nwith pollen grains.\n\nStructure of microsporangium: In a transverse\n\nsection, a typical microsporangium appears near\n\ncircular in outline.  It is generally surrounded by four wall layers (Figure\n\n2.3 b)– the epidermis, endothecium, middle layers and the tapetum. The\n\nouter three wall layers perform the function of protection and help in\n\ndehiscence of anther to release the pollen.  The innermost wall layer is\n\nthe tapetum.  It nourishes the developing pollen grains. Cells of the\n\ntapetum possess dense cytoplasm and generally have more than one\n\nnucleus.  Can you think of how tapetal cells could become bi-nucleate?\n\nWhen the anther is young, a group of compactly arranged homogenous\n\ncells called the sporogenous tissue occupies the centre of each\n\nmicrosporangium.\n\nMicrosporogenesis : As the anther develops, the cells of the sporogenous\n\ntissue undergo meiotic divisions to form microspore tetrads.  What would\n\nbe the ploidy of the cells of the tetrad?\n\nFigure 2.2 (a) A typical stamen;\n(b) three–dimensional cut section\n of an anther\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n22\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nAs each cell of the sporogenous tissue is capable of giving rise to a\n\nmicrospore tetrad. Each one is a potential pollen or microspore mother\n\ncell. The process of formation of microspores from a pollen mother cell (PMC)\n\nthrough meiosis is called microsporogenesis. The microspores, as they\n\nare formed, are arranged in a cluster of four cells–the microspore tetrad\n\n(Figure 2.3 a).  As the anthers mature and dehydrate, the microspores\n\ndissociate from each other and develop into pollen grains (Figure 2.3 b).\n\nInside each microsporangium several thousands of microspores or pollen\n\ngrains are formed that are released with the dehiscence of anther\n\n(Figure 2.3 c).\n\nPollen grain: The pollen grains represent the male gametophytes.  If you\n\ntouch the opened anthers of Hibiscus or any other flower you would find\n\ndeposition of yellowish powdery pollen grains on your fingers. Sprinkle\n\nthese grains on a drop of water taken on a glass slide and observe under\n\n(c)\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 2.3 (a) Transverse section of a young anther; (b) Enlarged view of one microsporangium\nshowing wall layers; (c) A mature dehisced anther\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n23\n\nHUMAN REPRODUCTIONSEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN FLOWERING PLANTS\n\na microscope.  You will really be amazed at the variety of architecture –\n\nsizes, shapes, colours, designs – seen on the pollen grains\n\nfrom different species (Figure 2.4).\n\nPollen grains are generally spherical measuring about\n\n25-50 micrometers in diameter. It has a prominent two-layered\n\nwall.  The hard outer layer called the exine is made up of\n\nsporopollenin which is one of the most resistant organic material\n\nknown. It can withstand high temperatures and strong acids\n\nand alkali. No enzyme that degrades sporopollenin is so far\n\nknown. Pollen grain exine has prominent apertures called germ\n\npores where sporopollenin is absent.  Pollen grains are well-\n\npreserved as fossils because of the presence of sporopollenin.\n\nThe exine exhibits a fascinating array of patterns and designs.\n\nWhy do you think the exine should be hard?  What is the\n\nfunction of germ pore?  The inner wall of the pollen grain is\n\ncalled the intine.  It is a thin and continuous layer made up of\n\ncellulose and pectin.  The cytoplasm of pollen grain is\n\nsurrounded by a plasma membrane.  When the pollen grain is\n\nmature it contains two cells, the vegetative cell and generative\n\ncell (Figure 2.5b).  The vegetative cell is bigger, has abundant\n\nfood reserve and a large irregularly shaped nucleus. The\n\ngenerative cell is small and floats in the cytoplasm of the\n\nvegetative cell.  It is spindle shaped with dense cytoplasm and\n\na nucleus.  In over 60 per cent of angiosperms, pollen grains\n\nare shed at this 2-celled stage. In the remaining species, the\n\ngenerative cell divides mitotically to give rise to the two male\n\ngametes before pollen grains are shed (3-celled stage).\n\nPollen grains of many species cause severe allergies and bronchial\n\nafflictions in some people often leading to chronic respiratory\n\ndisorders– asthma, bronchitis, etc. It may be mentioned that Parthenium\n\nor carrot grass that came into India as a contaminant with imported wheat,\n\nhas become ubiquitous in occurrence and causes pollen allergy.\n\nFigure 2.5 (a) Enlarged view of\na pollen grain tetrad; (b) stages\nof a microspore maturing into a\npollen grain\n\nFigure 2.4 Scanning electron micrographs of a few pollen grains\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n24\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nWhen once they are shed, pollen grains have to land on the stigma\n\nbefore they lose viability if they have to bring about fertilisation. How long\n\ndo you think the pollen grains retain viability? The period for which pollen\n\ngrains remain viable is highly variable and to some extent depends on the\n\nprevailing temperature and humidity. In some cereals such as rice and\n\nwheat, pollen grains lose viability within 30 minutes of their release, and\n\nin some members of Rosaceae, Leguminoseae and Solanaceae, they\n\nmaintain viability for months. You may have heard of storing semen/\n\nsperms of many animals including humans for artificial insemination. It\n\nis possible to store pollen grains of a large number of species for years in\n\nliquid nitrogen (-1960C). Such stored pollen can be used as pollen banks,\n\nsimilar to seed banks, in crop breeding programmes.\n\n2.2.2 The Pistil, Megasporangium (ovule) and Embryo sac\n\nThe gynoecium represents the female reproductive part of the flower.  The\n\ngynoecium may consist of a single pistil (monocarpellary) or may have\n\nmore than one pistil (multicarpellary).  When there are more than one,\n\nthe pistils may be fused together (syncarpous) (Figure 2.7b) or may be\n\nfree (apocarpous) (Figure 2.7c). Each pistil has three parts (Figure 2.7a),\n\nthe stigma, style and ovary. The stigma serves as a landing platform\n\nfor pollen grains.  The style is the elongated slender part beneath the\n\nstigma.  The basal bulged part of the pistil is the ovary.  Inside the ovary\n\nis the ovarian cavity ( ( ( ( (locule).  The placenta is located inside the ovarian\ncavity.  Recall the definition and types of placentation that you studied in\n\nFigure 2.6 Pollen products\n\nPollen grains are rich in nutrients. It has become a fashion in recent\n\nyears to use pollen tablets as food supplements. In western countries, a\n\nlarge number of  pollen products in the form of tablets and syrups are\n\navailable in the market. Pollen consumption has been claimed to increase\n\nthe performance of athletes and race horses (Figure 2.6).\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n25\n\nHUMAN REPRODUCTIONSEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN FLOWERING PLANTS\n\nClass XI.  Arising from the placenta are the megasporangia, commonly\n\ncalled ovules.  The number of ovules in an ovary may be one (wheat,\n\npaddy, mango) to many (papaya, water melon, orchids).\n\nThe Megasporangium (Ovule) : Let us familiarise ourselves with the\n\nstructure of a typical angiosperm ovule (Figure 2.7d). The ovule is a small\n\nstructure attached to the placenta by means of a stalk called funicle.\n\nThe body of the ovule fuses with funicle in the region called hilum. Thus,\n\nhilum represents the junction between ovule and funicle. Each ovule has\n\none or two protective envelopes called integuments. Integuments encircle\n\nthe nucellus except at the tip where a small opening called the micropyle\n\nis organised. Opposite the micropylar end, is the chalaza, representing\n\nthe basal part of the ovule.\n\nEnclosed within the integuments is a mass of cells called the nucellus.\n\nCells of the nucellus have abundant reserve food materials.  Located in the\n\nnucellus is the embryo sac or female gametophyte. An ovule generally has\n\na single embryo sac formed from a megaspore.\n\nMegasporogenesis : The process of formation of megaspores from the\n\nmegaspore mother cell is called megasporogenesis. Ovules generally\n\ndifferentiate a single megaspore mother cell (MMC) in the micropylar region\n\nStigma\n\nStyle\n\nOvary\n\nThalamus\n\nFigure 2.7 (a) A dissected flower of Hibiscus showing pistil (other floral parts have been removed);\n(b) Multicarpellary, syncarpous pistil of Papaver ; (c) A multicarpellary, apocarpous\ngynoecium of Michelia; (d) A diagrammatic view of a typical anatropous ovule\n\n(a) (b) (c) (d)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n26\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nFigure 2.8 (a) Parts of the ovule showing a large megaspore mother cell, a dyad and a tetrad of\nmegaspores; (b) 2, 4, and 8-nucleate stages of embryo sac and a mature embryo sac; (c) A\ndiagrammatic representation of the mature embryo sac.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nof the nucellus. It is a large cell containing dense cytoplasm and a\n\nprominent nucleus. The MMC undergoes meiotic division. What is the\n\nimportance of the MMC undergoing meiosis? Meiosis results in the\n\nproduction of four megaspores (Figure 2.8a).\n\nFemale gametophyte : In a majority of flowering plants, one of the\n\nmegaspores is functional while the other three degenerate. Only the\n\nfunctional megaspore develops into the female gametophyte (embryo\n\nsac). This method of embryo sac formation from a single megaspore is termed\n\nmonosporic development. What will be the ploidy of the cells of the nucellus,\n\nMMC, the functional megaspore and female gametophyte?\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n27\n\nHUMAN REPRODUCTIONSEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN FLOWERING PLANTS\n\nLet us study formation of the embryo sac in a little more detail.\n\n(Figure 2.8b). The nucleus of the functional megaspore divides mitotically\n\nto form two nuclei which move to the opposite poles, forming the\n\n2-nucleate embryo sac. Two more sequential mitotic nuclear divisions\n\nresult in the formation of the 4-nucleate and later the 8-nucleate stages\n\nof the embryo sac. It is of interest to note that these mitotic divisions are\n\nstrictly free nuclear, that is, nuclear divisions are not followed immediately\n\nby cell wall formation. After the 8-nucleate stage, cell walls are laid down\n\nleading to the organisation of the typical female gametophyte\n\nor embryo sac. Observe the distribution of cells inside the embryo sac\n\n(Figure 2.8b, c).  Six of the eight nuclei are surrounded by cell walls and\n\norganised into cells; the remaining two nuclei, called polar nuclei are\n\nsituated below the egg apparatus in the large central cell.\n\nThere is a characteristic distribution of the cells within the embryo\n\nsac. Three cells are grouped together at the micropylar end and constitute\n\nthe egg apparatus.  The egg apparatus, in turn, consists of two synergids\n\nand one egg cell. The synergids have special cellular thickenings at the\n\nmicropylar tip called filiform apparatus, which play an important role in\n\nguiding the pollen tubes into the synergid. Three cells are at the chalazal\n\nend and are called the antipodals. The large central cell, as mentioned\n\nearlier, has two polar nuclei. Thus, a typical angiosperm embryo sac, at\n\nmaturity, though 8-nucleate is 7-celled.\n\n2.2.3 Pollination\n\nIn the preceding sections you have learnt that the male and female gametes\n\nin flowering plants are produced in the pollen grain and embryo sac,\n\nrespectively. As both types of gametes are non-motile, they have to be\n\nbrought together for fertilisation to occur. How is this achieved?\n\nPollination is the mechanism to achieve this objective. Transfer\n\nof pollen grains (shed from the anther) to the stigma of a pistil is\n\ntermed pollination. Flowering plants have evolved an amazing array\n\nof adaptations to achieve pollination. They make use of  external\n\nagents to achieve pollination. Can you list the possible external\n\nagents?\n\nKinds of Pollination : Depending on the source of pollen, pollination\n\ncan be divided into three types.\n\n(i) Autogamy : In this type, pollination is achieved within the same\n\nflower. Transfer of pollen grains from the anther to the stigma of the\n\nsame flower (Figure 2.9a). In a normal flower which opens and\n\nexposes the anthers and the stigma, complete autogamy is rather\n\nrare. Autogamy in such flowers requires synchrony in pollen release\n\nand stigma receptivity and also, the anthers and the stigma should\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n28\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nlie close to each other so that self-pollination\n\ncan occur. Some plants such as Viola\n\n(common pansy), Oxalis, and Commelina\n\nproduce two types of flowers –\n\nchasmogamous flowers which are similar to\n\nflowers of other species with exposed anthers\n\nand stigma, and cleistogamous flowers which\n\ndo not open at all (Figure 2.9c). In such flowers,\n\nthe anthers and stigma lie close to each other.\n\nWhen anthers dehisce in the flower buds,\n\npollen grains come in contact with the stigma\n\nto effect pollination. Thus, cleistogamous\n\nflowers are invariably autogamous as there is\n\nno chance of cross-pollen landing on the\n\nstigma. Cleistogamous flowers produce\n\nassured seed-set even in the absence of\n\npollinators. Do you think that cleistogamy is\n\nadvantageous or disadvantageous to the\n\nplant? Why?\n\n(ii) Geitonogamy – Transfer of pollen grains from\n\nthe anther to the stigma of another flower of\n\nthe same plant. Although geitonogamy is\n\nfunctionally cross-pollination involving a\n\npollinating agent, genetically it is similar to\n\nautogamy since the pollen grains come from\n\nthe same plant.\n\n(iii) Xenogamy – Transfer of pollen grains from\n\nanther to the stigma of a different plant (Figure\n\n2.9b). This is the only type of pollination which\n\nduring pollination brings genetically different\n\ntypes of pollen grains to the stigma.\n\nAgents of Pollination : Plants use two abiotic (wind\n\nand water) and one biotic (animals) agents to achieve\n\npollination. Majority of plants use biotic agents for\n\npollination. Only a small proportion of plants use\n\nabiotic agents. Pollen grains coming in contact with\n\nthe stigma is a chance factor in both wind and water\n\npollination. To compensate for this uncertainties and\n\nassociated loss of pollen grains, the flowers produce\n\nenormous amount of pollen when compared to the\n\nnumber of ovules available for pollination.\n\nFigure 2.9 (a) Self-pollinated flowers;\n(b) Cross pollinated flowers;\n(c) Cleistogamous flowers\n\n(a)\n\n(c)\n\n(b)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n29\n\nHUMAN REPRODUCTIONSEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN FLOWERING PLANTS\n\nPollination by wind is more common\n\namongst abiotic pollinations. Wind pollination\n\nalso requires that the pollen grains are light\n\nand non-sticky so that they can be\n\ntransported in wind currents. They often\n\npossess well-exposed stamens (so that the\n\npollens are easily dispersed into wind currents,\n\nFigure 2.10) and large often-feathery stigma\n\nto easily trap air-borne pollen grains. Wind-\n\npollinated flowers often have a single ovule in\n\neach ovary and numerous flowers packed into\n\nan inflorescence; a familiar example is the corn\n\ncob – the tassels you see are nothing but the\n\nstigma and style which wave in the wind to\n\ntrap pollen grains.  Wind-pollination is quite\n\ncommon in grasses.\n\nPollination by water is quite rare in\n\nflowering plants and is limited to about 30\n\ngenera, mostly monocotyledons. As against\n\nthis, you would recall that water is a regular\n\nmode of transport for the male gametes among\n\nthe lower plant groups such as algae,\n\nbryophytes and pteridophytes. It is believed,\n\nparticularly for some bryophytes and\n\npteridophytes, that their distribution is limited\n\nbecause of the need for water for the transport\n\nof male gametes and fertilisation. Some\n\nexamples of water pollinated plants are  Vallisneria and Hydrilla which\n\ngrow  in  fresh water and several marine sea-grasses such as Zostera. Not\n\nall aquatic plants use water for pollination. In a majority of aquatic plants\n\nsuch as water hyacinth and water lily, the flowers emerge above the level\n\nof water and are pollinated by insects or wind as in most of the land\n\nplants. In Vallisneria, the female flower reach the surface of water by the\n\nlong stalk and the male flowers or pollen grains are released on to the\n\nsurface of water. They are carried passively by water currents (Figure\n\n2.11a);  some of them eventually reach the female flowers and the stigma.\n\nIn another group of water pollinated plants such as seagrasses, female\n\nflowers remain submerged in water and the pollen grains are released\n\ninside the water. Pollen grains in many such species are long, ribbon like\n\nand they are carried passively inside the water; some of them reach the\n\nstigma and achieve pollination. In most of the water-pollinated species,\n\npollen grains are protected from wetting by a mucilaginous covering.\n\nBoth wind and water pollinated flowers are not very colourful and do\n\nnot produce nectar. What would be the reason for this?\n\nFigure 2.10 A wind-pollinated plant showing\ncompact inflorecence and well-\nexposed stamens\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n30\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nMajority of flowering plants use\n\na range of animals as pollinating\n\nagents. Bees, butterflies, flies,\n\nbeetles, wasps, ants, moths, birds\n\n(sunbirds and humming birds)  and\n\nbats are the common pollinating\n\nagents. (Figure 2.11b). Among the\n\nanimals, insects, particularly bees\n\nare the dominant biotic pollinating\n\nagents.  Even larger animals such\n\nas some primates (lemurs), arboreal\n\n(tree-dwelling) rodents, or even\n\nreptiles (gecko lizard and garden\n\nlizard) have also been reported as\n\npollinators in some species.\n\nOften flowers of animal-\n\npollinated plants are specifically\n\nadapted for a particular species of\n\nanimal.\n\nMajority of insect-pollinated\n\nflowers are large, colourful, fragrant\n\nand rich in nectar. When the flowers\n\nare small, a number of flowers are\n\nclustered into an inflorescence to\n\nmake them conspicuous. Animals\n\nare attracted to flowers by colour\n\nand/or fragrance. The flowers\n\npollinated by flies and beetles\n\nsecrete foul odours to attract these\n\nanimals. To sustain animal visits,\n\nthe flowers have to provide rewards\n\nto the animals. Nectar and pollen\n\ngrains are the usual floral rewards.\n\nFor harvesting the reward(s) from\n\nthe flower the animal visitor comes\n\nin contact with the anthers and the\n\nstigma. The body of the animal gets\n\na coating of pollen grains, which are\n\ngenerally sticky in animal pollinated flowers. When the animal carrying\n\npollen on its body comes in contact with the stigma, it brings about\n\npollination.\n\nIn some species floral rewards are in providing safe places to lay eggs;\n\nan example is that of the tallest flower of Amorphophallus (the flower\n\nitself is about 6 feet in height). A similar relationship exists between a\n\nspecies of moth and the plant Yucca where both species – moth and the\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 2.11 (a) Pollination by water in Vallisneria ;\n(b) Insect pollination\n\n\n\n31\n\nHUMAN REPRODUCTIONSEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN FLOWERING PLANTS\n\nplant – cannot complete their life cycles without each other. The moth\n\ndeposits its eggs in the locule of the ovary and the flower, in turn, gets\n\npollinated by the moth.  The larvae of the moth come out of the eggs as\n\nthe seeds start developing.\n\nWhy don’t you observe some flowers of the following plants (or any\n\nothers available to you): Cucumber, Mango, Peepal, Coriander, Papaya,\n\nOnion, Lobia, Cotton, Tobacco, Rose, Lemon, Eucalyptus, Banana? Try to\n\nfind out which animals visit them and whether they could be\n\npollinators.You’ll have to patiently observe the flowers over a few days\n\nand at different times of the day.  You could also try to see whether there\n\nis any correlation in the characteristics of a flower to the animal that\n\nvisits it. Carefully observe if any of the visitors come in contact with the\n\nanthers and the stigma as only such visitors can bring about pollination.\n\nMany insects may consume pollen or the nectar without bringing about\n\npollination. Such floral visitors are referred to as pollen/nectar robbers.\n\nYou may or may not be able to identify the pollinators, but you will surely\n\nenjoy your efforts!\n\nOutbreeding Devices : Majority of flowering plants produce hermaphrodite\n\nflowers and pollen grains are likely to come in contact with the stigma of\n\nthe same flower. Continued self-pollination result in inbreeding depression.\n\nFlowering plants have developed many devices to discourage self-\n\npollination and to encourage cross-pollination. In some species, pollen\n\nrelease and stigma receptivity are not synchronised. Either the pollen is\n\nreleased before the stigma becomes receptive or stigma becomes receptive\n\nmuch before the release of pollen. In some other species, the anther and\n\nstigma are placed at different positions so that the pollen cannot come in\n\ncontact with the stigma of the same flower. Both these devices prevent\n\nautogamy. The third device to prevent inbreeding is self-incompatibility.\n\nThis is a genetic mechanism and prevents self-pollen (from the same flower\n\nor other flowers of the same plant) from fertilising the ovules by inhibiting\n\npollen germination or pollen tube growth in the pistil.  Another device to\n\nprevent self-pollination is the production of unisexual flowers. If both male\n\nand female flowers are present on the same plant such as castor and maize\n\n(monoecious), it prevents autogamy but not geitonogamy. In several species\n\nsuch as papaya, male and female flowers are present on different plants,\n\nthat is each plant is either male or female (dioecy). This condition prevents\n\nboth autogamy and geitonogamy.\n\nPollen-pistil Interaction : Pollination does not guarantee the transfer\n\nof the right type of pollen (compatible pollen of the same species as the\n\nstigma). Often, pollen of the wrong type, either from other species or from\n\nthe same plant (if it is self-incompatible), also land on the stigma. The\n\npistil has the ability to recognise the pollen, whether it is of the right type\n\n(compatible) or of the wrong type (incompatible). If it is of the right type,\n\nthe pistil accepts the pollen and promotes post-pollination events that\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n32\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nleads to fertilisation. If the pollen is of the wrong type, the pistil rejects the\n\npollen by preventing pollen germination on the stigma or the pollen tube\n\ngrowth in the style. The ability of the pistil to recognise the pollen followed\n\nby its acceptance or rejection is the result of a continuous dialogue\n\nbetween pollen grain and the pistil. This dialogue is mediated by chemical\n\ncomponents of the pollen interacting with those of the pistil. It is only in\n\nrecent years that botanists have been able to identify some of the pollen\n\nand pistil components and the interactions leading to the recognition,\n\nfollowed by acceptance or rejection.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, following compatible pollination, the pollen grain\n\ngerminates on the stigma to produce a pollen tube through one of the\n\ngerm pores (Figure 2.12a). The contents of the pollen grain move into the\n\nFigure 2.12 (a) Pollen grains germinating on the stigma; (b) Pollen tubes growing through the\nstyle; (c) L.S. of pistil showing path of pollen tube growth; (d) enlarged view of an\negg apparatus showing entry of pollen tube into a synergid; (e) Discharge of male\ngametes into a synergid and the movements of the sperms, one into the egg and\nthe other into the central cell\n\n(e)\n(d)\n\n(a) (b) (c)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n33\n\nHUMAN REPRODUCTIONSEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN FLOWERING PLANTS\n\npollen tube. Pollen tube grows through the tissues of the stigma and\n\nstyle and reaches the ovary (Figure 2.12b, c). You would recall that in\n\nsome plants, pollen grains are shed at two-celled condition (a vegetative\n\ncell and a generative cell).  In such plants, the generative cell divides and\n\nforms the two male gametes during the growth of pollen tube in the stigma.\n\nIn plants which shed pollen in the three-celled condition, pollen tubes\n\ncarry the two male gametes from the beginning. Pollen tube, after reaching\n\nthe ovary, enters the ovule through the micropyle and then enters one of\n\nthe synergids through the filiform apparatus (Figure 2.12d, e). Many recent\n\nstudies have shown that filiform apparatus present at the micropylar part\n\nof the synergids guides the entry of pollen tube.  All these events–from\n\npollen deposition on the stigma until pollen tubes enter the ovule–are\n\ntogether referred to as pollen-pistil interaction. As pointed out earlier,\n\npollen-pistil interaction is a dynamic process involving pollen recognition\n\nfollowed by promotion or inhibition of the pollen. The knowledge gained\n\nin this area would help the plant breeder in manipulating pollen-pistil\n\ninteraction, even in incompatible pollinations, to get desired hybrids.\n\nYou can easily study pollen germination by dusting some pollen from\n\nflowers such as  pea, chickpea, Crotalaria, balsam and Vinca on a glass slide\n\ncontaining a drop of sugar solution (about 10 per cent). After about 15–30\n\nminutes, observe the slide under the low power lens of the microscope.  You\n\nare likely to see pollen tubes coming out of the pollen grains.\n\nAs you shall learn in the chapter on plant breeding (Chapter 9), a\n\nbreeder is interested in crossing different species and often genera to\n\ncombine desirable characters to produce commercially ‘superior’ varieties.\n\nArtificial hybridisation is one of the major approaches of crop\n\nimprovement programme. In such crossing experiments it is important\n\nto make sure that only the desired pollen grains are used for pollination\n\nand the stigma is protected from contamination (from unwanted pollen).\n\nThis is achieved by emasculation and bagging techniques.\n\nIf the female parent bears bisexual flowers, removal of anthers from\n\nthe flower bud before the anther dehisces using a pair of forceps is\n\nnecessary. This step is referred to as emasculation. Emasculated flowers\n\nhave to be covered with a bag of suitable size, generally made up of butter\n\npaper, to prevent contamination of its stigma with unwanted pollen. This\n\nprocess is called bagging. When the stigma of bagged flower attains\n\nreceptivity, mature pollen grains collected from anthers of the male parent\n\nare dusted on the stigma, and the flowers are rebagged, and the fruits\n\nallowed to develop.\n\nIf the female parent produces unisexual flowers, there is no need for\n\nemasculation. The female flower buds are bagged before the flowers open.\n\nWhen the stigma becomes receptive, pollination is carried out using the\n\ndesired pollen and the flower rebagged.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n34\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n2.4  POST-FERTILISATION : STRUCTURES AND EVENTS\n\nFollowing double fertilisation, events of  endosperm and embryo\n\ndevelopment, maturation of ovule(s) into seed(s) and ovary into fruit, are\n\ncollectively termed post-fertilisation events.\n\n2.4.1 Endosperm\n\nEndosperm development precedes embryo development. Why? The\n\nprimary endosperm cell divides repeatedly and forms a triploid\n\nFigure 2.13 (a) Fertilised embryo sac showing zygote and Primary Endosperm Nucleus (PEN);\n(b) Stages in embryo development in a dicot [shown in reduced size as compared to (a)]\n\n(a) (b)\n\n2.3 DOUBLE FERTILISATION\n\nAfter entering one of the synergids, the pollen tube releases the two male\n\ngametes into the cytoplasm of the synergid.  One of the male gametes\n\nmoves towards the egg cell and fuses with its nucleus thus completing the\n\nsyngamy.  This results in the formation of a diploid cell, the zygote. The\n\nother male gamete moves towards the two polar nuclei located in the central\n\ncell and fuses with them to produce a triploid primary endosperm nucleus\n\n(PEN) (Figure 2.13a).  As this involves the fusion of three haploid nuclei it\n\nis termed triple fusion. Since two types of fusions, syngamy and triple\n\nfusion take place in an embryo sac the phenomenon is termed double\n\nfertilisation, an event unique to flowering plants. The central cell after\n\ntriple fusion becomes the primary endosperm cell (PEC) and develops\n\ninto the endosperm while the zygote develops into an embryo.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n35\n\nHUMAN REPRODUCTIONSEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN FLOWERING PLANTS\n\nendosperm tissue. The cells of this tissue are filled with\n\nreserve food materials and are used for the nutrition of\n\nthe developing embryo. In the most common type of\n\nendosperm development, the PEN undergoes successive\n\nnuclear divisions to give rise to free nuclei. This stage of\n\nendosperm development is called free-nuclear endosperm.\n\nSubsequently cell  wall formation occurs and the\n\nendosperm becomes cellular. The number of free nuclei\n\nformed before cellularisation varies greatly. The coconut\n\nwater from tender coconut that you are familiar with, is\n\nnothing but free-nuclear endosperm (made up of\n\nthousands of nuclei) and the surrounding white kernel is\n\nthe cellular endosperm.\n\nEndosperm may either be completely consumed by the\n\ndeveloping embryo (e.g., pea, groundnut, beans) before seed\n\nmaturation or it may persist in the mature seed (e.g. castor\n\nand coconut) and be used up during seed germination. Split\n\nopen some seeds of castor, peas, beans, groundnut, fruit of\n\ncoconut and look for the endosperm in each case.  Find out\n\nwhether the endosperm is persistent in cereals – wheat, rice\n\nand maize.\n\n2.4.2 Embryo\n\nEmbryo develops at the micropylar end of the embryo sac where\n\nthe zygote is situated. Most zygotes divide only after certain\n\namount of endosperm is formed. This is an adaptation to\n\nprovide assured nutrition to the developing embryo. Though\n\nthe seeds differ greatly, the early stages of embryo development\n\n(embryogeny) are similar in both monocotyledons and\n\ndicotyledons. Figure 2.13 depicts the stages of embryogeny in\n\na dicotyledonous embryo.  The zygote gives rise to the\n\nproembryo and subsequently to the globular, heart-shaped\n\nand mature embryo.\n\nA typical dicotyledonous embryo (Figure 2.14a), consists\n\nof an embryonal axis and two cotyledons. The portion of\n\nembryonal axis above the level of cotyledons is the epicotyl,\n\nwhich terminates with the plumule or stem tip. The cylindrical\n\nportion below the level of cotyledons is hypocotyl that\n\nterminates at its lower end in the radicle or root tip.  The root\n\ntip is covered with a root cap.\n\nEmbryos of monocotyledons (Figure 2.14 b) possess only\n\none cotyledon. In the grass family the cotyledon is called\n\nscutellum that is situated towards one side (lateral) of the\n\nembryonal axis. At its lower end, the embryonal axis has the\n\nFigure 2.14 (a) A typical dicot\nembryo; (b)  L.S. of an\nembryo of grass\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n36\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nradical and root cap enclosed in an undifferentiated sheath called\n\ncoleorrhiza. The portion of the embryonal axis above the level of\n\nattachment of scutellum is the epicotyl. Epicotyl has a shoot apex and a\n\nfew leaf primordia enclosed in a hollow foliar structure, the coleoptile.\n\nSoak a few seeds in water (say of wheat, maize, peas, chickpeas,\n\nground nut) overnight.  Then split the seeds and observe the various\n\nparts of the embryo and the seed.\n\n2.4.3 Seed\n\nIn angiosperms, the seed is the final product of sexual reproduction.  It is\n\noften described as a fertilised ovule. Seeds are formed inside fruits. A\n\nseed typically consists of seed coat(s), cotyledon(s) and an embryo axis.\n\nThe cotyledons (Figure 2.15a) of the embryo are simple structures,\n\ngenerally thick and swollen due to storage of food reserves (as in legumes).\n\nMature seeds may be non-albuminous or ex-albuminous. Non-\n\nalbuminous seeds have no residual endosperm as it is completely\n\nconsumed during embryo development (e.g., pea, groundnut).\n\nAlbuminous seeds retain a part of endosperm as it is not completely used\n\nup during embryo development (e.g., wheat, maize, barley, castor).\n\nOccasionally, in some seeds such as black pepper and beet, remnants of\n\nnucellus are also persistent.  This residual, persistent nucellus is the\n\nperisperm.\n\nInteguments of ovules harden as tough protective seed coats\n\n(Figure 2.15a). The micropyle remains as a small pore in the seed coat.\n\nThis facilitates entry of oxygen and water into the seed during germination.\n\nAs the seed matures, its water content is reduced and seeds become\n\nrelatively dry (10-15 per cent moisture by mass). The general metabolic\n\nactivity of the embryo slows down.  The embryo may  enter a state of\n\ninactivity called dormancy, or if favourable conditions are available\n\n(adequate moisture, oxygen and suitable temperature), they germinate.\n\nAs ovules mature into seeds, the ovary develops into a fruit, i.e., the\n\ntransformation of ovules into seeds and ovary into fruit proceeds\n\nsimultaneously.  The wall of the ovary develops into the wall of fruit called\n\npericarp.  The fruits may be fleshy as in guava, orange, mango, etc., or\n\nmay be dry, as in groundnut, and  mustard, etc.  Many fruits have evolved\n\nmechanisms for dispersal of seeds.  Recall the classification of fruits and\n\ntheir dispersal mechanisms that you have studied in an earlier class. Is\n\nthere any relationship between number of ovules in an ovary and the\n\nnumber of seeds present in a fruit?\n\nIn most plants, by the time the fruit develops from the ovary, other\n\nfloral parts degenerate and fall off. However, in a few species such as apple,\n\nstrawberry, cashew, etc., the thalamus  also contributes to fruit formation.\n\nSuch fruits are called false fruits (Figure 2.15b).  Most fruits however\n\ndevelop only from the ovary and are called true fruits. Although in most\n\nof the species, fruits are the results of fertilisation, there are a few species\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n37\n\nHUMAN REPRODUCTIONSEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN FLOWERING PLANTS\n\nin which fruits develop without fertilisation. Such fruits are called\n\nparthenocarpic fruits. Banana is one such example. Parthenocarpy can\n\nbe induced through the application of growth hormones and such fruits\n\nare seedless.\n\nSeeds offer several advantages to angiosperms. Firstly, since\n\nreproductive processes such as pollination and fertilisation are\n\nindependent of water, seed formation is more dependable. Also seeds have\n\nbetter adaptive strategies for dispersal to new habitats and help the species\n\nFigure 2.15 (a) Structure of some seeds. (b) False fruits of apple and strawberry\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n38\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nto colonise in other areas. As they have  sufficient food reserves, young\n\nseedlings are nourished until they are capable of photosynthesis on their\n\nown. The hard seed coat provides protection to the young embryo. Being\n\nproducts of sexual reproduction, they generate new genetic combinations\n\nleading to variations.\n\nSeed is the basis of our agriculture. Dehydration and dormancy of\n\nmature seeds are crucial for storage of seeds which can be used as food\n\nthroughout the year and also to raise crop in the next season. Can you\n\nimagine agriculture in the absence of seeds, or in the presence of seeds\n\nwhich germinate straight away soon after formation and cannot be stored?\n\nHow long do the seeds remain alive after they are dispersed? This\n\nperiod again varies greatly. In a few species the seeds lose viability within\n\na few months. Seeds of a large number of species live for several years.\n\nSome seeds can remain alive for hundreds of years. There are several\n\nrecords of very old yet viable seeds. The oldest is that of a lupine, Lupinus\n\narcticus excavated from Arctic Tundra. The seed germinated and flowered\n\nafter an estimated record of 10,000 years of dormancy. A recent record of\n\n2000 years old viable seed is of the date palm, Phoenix dactylifera\n\ndiscovered during the archeological excavation at King Herod’s palace\n\nnear the Dead Sea.\n\nAfter completing a brief account of sexual reproduction of flowering\n\nplants it would be worth attempting to comprehend the enormous\n\nreproductive capacity of some flowering plants by asking  the following\n\nquestions:  How many eggs are present in an embryo sac? How many\n\nembryo sacs are present in an ovule? How many ovules are present in\n\nan ovary? How many ovaries are present in a typical flower? How many\n\nflowers are present on a tree? And so on...\n\nCan you think of some plants in which fruits contain very large\n\nnumber of seeds. Orchid fruits are one such category and each fruit\n\ncontain thousands of tiny seeds. Similar is the case in fruits of some\n\nparasitic species such as Orobanche and Striga.  Have you seen a tiny\n\nseed of Ficus? How large is the tree of Ficus developed from that tiny\n\nseed. How many billions of seeds does each Ficus tree produce? Can\n\nyou imagine any other example in which such a tiny structure can\n\nproduce such a large biomass over the years?\n\n2.5  APOMIXIS AND POLYEMBRYONY\n\nAlthough seeds, in general are the products of fertilisation, a few flowering\n\nplants such as some species of Asteraceae and grasses, have evolved a\n\nspecial mechanism, to produce seeds without fertilisation, called apomixis.\n\nWhat is fruit production without fertilisation called? Thus, apomixis is a\n\nform of asexual reproduction that mimics sexual reproduction. There are\n\nseveral ways of development of apomictic seeds. In some species, the\n\ndiploid egg cell is formed without reduction division and develops into\n\nthe embryo without fertilisation. More often, as in many Citrus and Mango\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n39\n\nHUMAN REPRODUCTIONSEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN FLOWERING PLANTS\n\nSUMMARY\n\nFlowers are the seat of sexual reproduction in angiosperms.  In the flower,\nandroecium consisting of stamens represents the male reproductive\norgans and gynoecium consisting of pistils represents the female\nreproductive organs.\n\nA typical anther is bilobed, dithecous and tetrasporangiate.  Pollen\ngrains develop inside the microsporangia.  Four wall layers, the\nepidermis, endothecium, middle layers and the tapetum surround the\nmicrosporangium. Cells of the  sporogenous tissue lying in the centre of\nthe microsporangium, undergo meiosis (microsporogenesis) to form\ntetrads of microspores.  Individual microspores mature into pollen grains.\n\nPollen grains represents the male gametophytic generation.  The\npollen grains have a two-layered wall, the outer exine and inner intine.\nThe exine is made up of sporopollenin and has germ pores.  Pollen grains\nmay have two cells (a vegetative cell and generative cell) or three cells (a\nvegetative cell and two male gametes) at the time of shedding.\n\nThe pistil has three parts – the stigma, style and the ovary.  Ovules\nare present in the ovary. The ovules have a stalk called funicle, protective\nintegument(s), and an opening called micropyle. The central tissue is\nthe nucellus in which the archesporium differentiates. A cell of the\narchesporium, the megaspore mother cell divides meiotically and one of\nthe megaspores forms the embryo sac (the female gametophyte). The\nmature embryo sac is 7-celled and 8-nucleate.  At the micropylar end is\n\nvarieties some of the nucellar cells surrounding the embryo sac start\n\ndividing, protrude into the embryo sac and develop into the embryos. In\n\nsuch species each ovule contains many embryos. Occurrence of more\n\nthan one embryo in a seed is referred to as polyembryony. Take out\n\nsome seeds of orange and squeeze them. Observe the many embryos of\n\ndifferent sizes and shapes from each seed. Count the number of embryos\n\nin each seed. What would be the genetic nature of apomictic embryos?\n\nCan they be called clones?\n\nHybrid varieties of several of our food and vegetable crops are being\n\nextensively cultivated. Cultivation of hybrids has tremendously increased\n\nproductivity. One of the problems of hybrids is that hybrid seeds have\n\nto be produced every year. If the seeds collected from hybrids are sown,\n\nthe plants in the progeny will segregate and do not maintain hybrid\n\ncharacters. Production of hybrid seeds is costly and hence the cost of\n\nhybrid seeds become too expensive for the farmers. If  these hybrids are\n\nmade into apomicts, there is no segregation of characters in the hybrid\n\nprogeny. Then the farmers can keep on using the hybrid seeds to raise\n\nnew crop year after year and he does not have to buy hybrid seeds every\n\nyear. Because of the importance of apomixis in hybrid seed industry,\n\nactive research is going on in many laboratories around the world to\n\nunderstand the genetics of apomixis and to transfer apomictic genes\n\ninto hybrid varieties.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n40\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1.

At the centre is a large central cell\nwith two polar nuclei.\n\nPollination is the mechanism to transfer pollen grains from the\nanther to the stigma.  Pollinating agents are either abiotic (wind and\nwater) or biotic (animals).\n\nPollen-pistil interaction involves all events from the landing of pollen\ngrains on the stigma until the pollen tube enters the embryo sac (when\nthe pollen is compatible) or pollen inhibition (when the pollen is\nincompatible).  Following compatible pollination, pollen grain germinates\non the stigma and the resulting  pollen tube grow through the style,\nenter the ovules and finally discharges two male gametes in one of the\nsynergids.  Angiosperms exhibit double fertilisation because two fusion\nevents occur in each embryo sac, namely syngamy and triple fusion.\nThe products of these fusions are the diploid zygote and the triploid\nprimary endosperm nucleus (in the primary endosperm cell). Zygote\ndevelops into the embryo and the primary endosperm cell forms the\nendosperm tissue. Formation of endosperm always precedes\ndevelopment of the embryo.\n\nThe developing embryo passes through different stages such as\nthe proembryo, globular and heart-shaped stages before maturation.\nMature dicotyledonous embryo has two cotyledons and an embryonal\naxis with epicotyl and hypocotyl.  Embryos of monocotyledons have a\nsingle cotyledon.  After fertilisation, ovary develops into fruit and ovules\ndevelop into seeds.\n\nA phenomenon called apomixis is found in some angiosperms,\nparticularly in grasses. It results in the formation of seeds without\nfertilisation.  Apomicts have several advantages in horticulture and\nagriculture.\n\nSome angiosperms produce more than one embryo in their seed.\n\nThis phenomenon is called polyembryony.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n41\n\nHUMAN REPRODUCTIONSEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN FLOWERING PLANTS\n\n7.
