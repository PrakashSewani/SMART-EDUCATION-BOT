This means increase in demand for\n\nfood, water, home, electricity, roads, automobiles and\n\nnumerous other commodities. These demands are exerting\n\ntremendous pressure on our natural resources, and are\n\nalso contributing to pollution of air, water and soil. The\n\nneed of the hour is to check the degradation and depletion\n\nof our precious natural resources and pollution without\n\nhalting the process of development.\n\nPollution is any undesirable change in physical,\n\nchemical or biological characteristics of air, land, water or\n\nsoil. Agents that bring about such an undesirable change\n\nare called as pollutants. In order to control environmental\n\npollution, the Government of India has passed the\n\nEnvironment (Protection) Act, 1986 to protect\n\nand improve the quality of our environment (air, water\n\nand soil).\n\n16.1 AIR POLLUTION AND ITS CONTROL\n\nWe are dependent on air for our respiratory needs.  Air\n\npollutants cause injury to all living organisms. They\n\nreduce growth and yield of crops and cause premature\n\ndeath of plants. Air pollutants also deleteriously affect the\n\nrespiratory system of humans and of animals. Harmful\n\nCHAPTER 16\n\nENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES\n\n16.1 Air Pollution and Its\n\nControl\n\n16.2 Water Pollution and Its\n\nControl\n\n16.3 Solid Wastes\n\n16.4 Agro-chemicals and\n\ntheir Effects\n\n16.5 Radioactive Wastes\n\n16.6 Greenhouse Effect and\n\nGlobal Warming\n\n16.7 Ozone Depletion in the\n\nStratosphere\n\n16.8 Degradation by Improper\n\nResource Utilisation and\n\nMaintenance\n\n16.9 Deforestation\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n271\n\nENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES\n\neffects depend on the concentration of pollutants, duration of exposure\n\nand the organism.\n\nSmokestacks of thermal power plants, smelters and other industries\n\nrelease particulate and gaseous air pollutants together with harmless\n\ngases, such as nitrogen, oxygen, etc. These pollutants must be separated/\n\nfiltered out before releasing the harmless gases into the atmosphere.\n\nFigure 16.1 Electrostatic precipitator\n\nThere are several ways of removing particulate matter; the most widely\n\nused of which is the electrostatic precipitator (Figure 16.1), which can\n\nremove over 99 per cent particulate matter present in the exhaust from a\n\nthermal power plant. It has electrode wires that are maintained at several\n\nthousand volts, which produce a corona that releases electrons. These\n\nelectrons attach to dust particles giving them a net negative charge. The\n\ncollecting plates are grounded and attract the charged dust particles.\n\nThe velocity of air between the plates must be low enough to allow the\n\ndust to fall. A scrubber (Figure 16.1) can remove gases like sulphur\n\ndioxide. In a scrubber, the exhaust is passed through a spray of water or\n\nlime. Recently we have realised the dangers of particulate matter that are\n\nvery very small and are not removed by these precipitators. According to\n\nCentral Pollution Control Board (CPCB), particulate size 2.5 micrometers\n\nor less in diameter (PM 2.5) are responsible for causing the greatest harm\n\nto human health. These fine particulates can be inhaled deep into the\n\nlungs and can cause breathing and respiratory symptoms, irritation,\n\ninflammations and damage to the lungs and premature deaths.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n272\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nAutomobiles are a major cause for atmospheric pollution atleast in\n\nthe metro cities.  As the number of vehicles increase on the streets, this\n\nproblem is now shifting to the other cities too. Proper maintenance of\n\nautomobiles along with use of lead-free petrol or diesel can reduce the\n\npollutants they emit. Catalytic converters, having expensive metals namely\n\nplatinum-palladium and rhodium as the catalysts, are fitted into\n\nautomobiles for reducing emission of poisonous gases. As the exhaust\n\npasses through the catalytic converter, unburnt hydrocarbons are\n\nconverted into carbon dioxide and water, and carbon monoxide and nitric\n\noxide are changed to carbon dioxide and nitrogen gas, respectively. Motor\n\nvehicles equipped with catalytic converter should use unleaded petrol\n\nbecause lead in the petrol inactivates the catalyst.\n\nIn India, the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act came\n\ninto force in 1981, but was amended in 1987 to include noise as an air\n\npollutant. Noise is undesired high level of sound. We have got used to\n\nassociating loud sounds with pleasure and entertainment not realising\n\nthat noise causes psychological and physiological disorders in humans.\n\nThe bigger the city, the bigger the function, the greater the noise!!  A\n\nbrief exposure to extremely high sound level, 150 dB or more generated\n\nby take off of a jet plane or rocket, may damage ear drums thus\n\npermanently impairing hearing ability. Even chronic exposure to a\n\nrelatively lower noise level of cities may permanently damage hearing\n\nabilities of humans. Noise also causes sleeplessness, increased heart\n\nbeat, altered breathing pattern, thus considerably stressing humans.\n\nConsidering the many dangerous effects of noise pollution can you\n\nidentify the unnecessary sources of noise pollution around you which\n\ncan be reduced immediately without any financial loss to anybody?\n\nReduction of noise in our industries can be affected by use of sound-\n\nabsorbent materials or by muffling noise.  Stringent following of laws laid\n\ndown in relation to noise like delimitation of horn-free zones around\n\nhospitals and schools,  permissible sound-levels of crackers and of loud-\n\nspeakers, timings after which loudspeakers cannot be played, etc., need\n\nto be enforced to protect ourselves from noise pollution.\n\n16.1.1 Controlling Vehicular Air Pollution: A Case\nStudy of Delhi\n\nWith its very large population of vehicular traffic, Delhi leads the coun-\n\ntry in its levels of air-pollution – it has more cars than the states of\n\nGujarat and West Bengal put together.  In the 1990s, Delhi ranked\n\nfourth among the 41 most polluted cities of the world.  Air pollution\n\nproblems in Delhi became so serious that a public interest litigation\n\n(PIL) was filed in the Supreme Court of India. After being censured very\n\nstrongly by the Supreme Court, under its directives, the government\n\nwas asked to take, within a specified time period, appropriate meas-\n\nures, including switching over the entire fleet of public transport, i.e.,\n\nbuses, from diesel to compressed natural gas (CNG).  All the buses of\n\nDelhi were converted to run on CNG by the end of 2002. You may ask\n\nthe question as to why CNG is better than diesel. The answer is that\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n273\n\nENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES\n\nCNG burns most efficiently, unlike petrol or diesel, in the automobiles\n\nand very little of it is left unburnt. Moreover, CNG is cheaper than petrol\n\nor diesel, cannot be siphoned off by thieves and adulterated like petrol\n\nor diesel. The main problem with switching over to CNG is the difficulty\n\nof laying down pipelines to deliver CNG through distribution points/\n\npumps and ensuring uninterrupted supply.  Simultaneously parallel\n\nsteps taken in Delhi for reducing vehicular pollution include phasing\n\nout of old vehicles, use of unleaded petrol, use of low-sulphur petrol\n\nand diesel, use of catalytic converters in vehicles, application of stringent\n\npollution-level norms for vehicles, etc.\n\nThe Government of India through a new auto fuel policy has laid\n\nout a roadmap to cut down vehicular pollution in Indian cities. More\n\nstringent norms for fuels means steadily reducing the sulphur and\n\naromatic content in petrol and diesel fuels. Euro III norms, for example,\n\nstipulate that sulphur be controlled at 350 parts-per-million (ppm) in\n\ndiesel and 150 ppm in petrol. Aromatic hydrocarbons are to be contained\n\nat 42 per cent of the concerned fuel. The goal, according to the roadmap,\n\nis to reduce sulphur to 50 ppm in petrol and diesel and bring down the\n\nlevel to 35 per cent. Corresponding to the fuel, vehicle engines will also\n\nneed to be upgraded.\n\nMass Emission Standards (Bharat Stage II which is equivalent to\n\nEuro-II norms) are no more applicable in any of the cities of India.\n\nDetails of the latest Mass Emission Standards in India are provided\n\nbelow (Table 16.1)\n\nType of Vehicles Norms Cities of Implementation\n\n4 Wheelers Bharat Stage IV Throughout the country\n\nsince April 2017\n\n3 Wheelers Bharat Stage IV Throughout the country\n\nsince 1st April 2017\n\n2 Wheelers Bharat Stage IV Throughout the country\n\nsince April 2017\n\nTable 16.1: Table Showing the Mass Emission Standards in India\n\nThanks to the efforts made, the air quality of Delhi has significantly\n\nimproved. According to an estimate, a substantial fall in CO\n2\n and SO\n\n2\n\nlevel has been found in Delhi between 1997 and 2005.\n\n16.2  WATER POLLUTION AND ITS CONTROL\n\nHuman beings have been abusing the water-bodies around the world by\n\ndisposing into them all kinds of waste. We tend to believe that water can\n\nwash away everything not taking cognizance of the fact that the water\n\nbodies are our lifeline as well as that of all other living organisms. Can\n\nyou list what all we tend to try and wash away through our rivers and\n\ndrains? Due to such activities of human kind, the ponds, lakes, stream,\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n274\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nrivers, estuaries and oceans are becoming polluted in several parts of the\n\nworld. Realising the importance of maintaining the cleanliness of the water\n\nbodies, the Government of India has passed the Water (Prevention and\n\nControl of Pollution) Act, 1974 to safeguard our water resources.\n\n16.2.1 Domestic Sewage and Industrial Effluents\n\nAs we work with water in our homes in the cities and towns, we wash\n\neverything into drains.  Have you\n\never wondered where the sewage\n\nthat comes out of our houses go?\n\nWhat happens in villages? Is the\n\nsewage treated before being\n\ntransported to the nearest river\n\nand mixed with it?  A mere 0.1\n\nper cent impurities make\n\ndomestic sewage unfit for human\n\nuse (Figure 16.2). You have read\n\nabout sewage treatment\n\nplants in Chapter 10. Solids are\n\nrelatively easy to remove, what\n\nis most difficult to remove are\nFigure 16.2 Composition of waste water\n\nFigure 16.3  Effect of sewage discharge on some important characteristics of a river\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n275\n\nENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES\n\ndissolved salts such as nitrates, phosphates, and other nutrients, and\n\ntoxic metal ions and organic compounds. Domestic sewage primarily\n\ncontains biodegradable organic matter, which readily decomposes –\n\nthanks to bacteria and other micro-organisms, which can multiply using\n\nthese organic substances as substrates and hence utilise some of the\n\ncomponents of sewage. It is possible to estimate the amount of\n\nbiodegradable organic matter in sewage water by measuring Biochemical\n\nOxygen Demand (BOD).  Can you explain how? In the chapter on micro-\n\norganisms you have read about the relation between BOD, micro-\n\norganisms and the amount of biodegradable matter.\n\nFigure 16.3 shows some of the changes that one may notice following\n\ndischarge of sewage into a river. Micro-organisms involved in\n\nbiodegradation of organic matter in the receiving water body consume a\n\nlot of oxygen, and as a result there is a sharp decline in dissolved oxygen\n\ndownstream from the point of sewage discharge. This causes mortality of\n\nfish and other aquatic creatures.\n\nPresence of large amounts of nutrients in waters also causes excessive\n\ngrowth of planktonic (free-floating) algae, called an algal bloom\n\n(Figure 16.4) which imparts a distinct colour to the water bodies. Algal\n\nblooms cause deterioration of the water quality and fish mortality.  Some\n\nbloom-forming algae are extremely toxic to human beings and animals.\n\nYou may have seen the beautiful mauve-colored flowers found on\n\nvery appealingly-shaped floating plants in water bodies.  These plants\n\nwhich were introduced into India for their lovely flowers have caused havoc\n\nby their excessive growth by causing blocks in our waterways. They grow\n\nfaster than our ability to remove them. These are plants of water hyacinth\n\n(Eichhornia crassipes), the world’s most problematic aquatic weed, also\n\nFigure 16.4 Pictorial view of an algal bloom\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n276\n\nBIOLOGY\n\ncalled ‘ Terror of Bengal ’. They grow abundantly in\n\neutrophic water bodies, and lead to an imbalance in the\n\necosystem dynamics of the water body.\n\nSewage from our homes as well as from hospitals are\n\nlikely to contain many undesirable pathogenic micro-\n\norganisms, and its disposal into a water  without proper\n\ntreatment may cause outbreak of serious diseases, such\n\nas, dysentery, typhoid, jaundice, cholera, etc.\n\nUnlike domestic sewage, waste water from industries\n\nlike petroleum, paper manufacturing, metal extraction and\n\nprocessing, chemical manufacturing, etc., often contain\n\ntoxic substances, notably, heavy metals (defined as\n\nelements with density > 5 g/cm3 such as mercury,\n\ncadmium, copper, lead, etc.) and a variety of organic\n\ncompounds.\n\nA few toxic substances, often present in industrial\n\nwaste waters, can undergo biological magnification\n\n(Biomagnification) in the aquatic food chain.\n\nBiomagnification refers to increase in concentration of\n\nthe toxicant at successive trophic levels. This happens\n\nbecause a toxic substance accumulated by an organism\n\ncannot be metabolised or excreted, and is thus passed on\n\nto the next higher trophic level.  This phenomenon is well-\n\nknown for mercury and DDT. Figure 16.5 shows\n\nbiomagnification of DDT in an aquatic food chain. In this\n\nmanner, the concentration of DDT is increased  at\n\nsuccessive trophic levels; say if it starts at 0.003 ppb\n\n(ppb = parts per billion) in water, it can ultimately reach\n\n25 ppm (ppm = parts per million) in fish-eating birds,\n\nthrough biomagnification. High concentrations of DDT\n\ndisturb calcium metabolism in birds, which causes\n\nthinning of eggshell and their premature breaking,\n\neventually causing decline in bird populations.\n\nEutrophication is the natural aging of a lake by\n\nnutrient enrichment of its water. In a young lake the water is cold and\n\nclear, supporting little life. With time, streams draining into the lake\n\nintroduce nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, which encourage\n\nthe growth of aquatic organisms. As the lake’s fertility increases, plant\n\nand animal life burgeons, and organic remains begin to be deposited on\n\nthe lake bottom. Over the centuries, as silt and organic debris pile up, the\n\nlake grows shallower and warmer, with warm-water organisms\n\nsupplanting those that thrive in a cold environment. Marsh plants take\n\nroot in the shallows and begin to fill in the original lake basin. Eventually,\n\nthe lake gives way to large masses of floating plants (bog), finally converting\n\ninto land. Depending on climate, size of the lake and other factors, the\n\nFigure 16.5 Biomagnification of\nDDT in an aquatic\nfood chain\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n277\n\nENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES\n\nnatural aging of a lake may span thousands of years. However, pollutants\n\nfrom man’s activities like effluents from the industries and homes can\n\nradically accelerate the aging process. This phenomenon has been called\n\nCultural or Accelerated Eutrophication. During the past century, lakes\n\nin many parts of the earth have been severely eutrophied by sewage and\n\nagricultural and industrial wastes. The prime contaminants are nitrates\n\nand phosphates, which act as plant nutrients. They overstimulate the\n\ngrowth of algae, causing unsightly scum and unpleasant odours, and\n\nrobbing the water of dissolved oxygen vital to other aquatic life. At the\n\nsame time, other pollutants flowing into a lake may poison whole\n\npopulations of fish, whose decomposing remains further deplete the\n\nwater’s dissolved oxygen content. In such fashion, a lake can literally\n\nchoke to death.\n\nHeated (thermal) wastewaters flowing out of electricity-generating units,\n\ne.g., thermal power plants, constitute another important category of\n\npollutants. Thermal wastewater eliminates or reduces the number of\n\norganisms sensitive to high temperature, and may enhance the growth of\n\nplants and fish in extremely cold areas but, only after causing damage to\n\nthe indigenous flora and fauna.\n\n16.2.2 A Case Study of Integrated Waste Water Treatment\n\nWastewater including sewage can be treated in an integrated manner, by\n\nutilising a mix of artificial and natural processes. An example of such an\n\ninitiative is the town of Arcata, situated along the northern coast of\n\nCalifornia. Collaborating with biologists from the Humboldt\n\nState University, the townspeople created an integrated waste water\n\ntreatment process within a natural system. The cleaning occurs in two\n\nstages – (a) the conventional sedimentation, filtering and chlorine\n\ntreatments are given. After this stage, lots of dangerous pollutants like\n\ndissolved heavy metals still remain. To combat this, an innovative\n\napproach was taken and (b) the biologists developed a series of six\n\nconnected marshes over 60 hectares of marshland. Appropriate plants,\n\nalgae, fungi and bacteria were seeded into this area, which neutralise,\n\nabsorb and assimilate the pollutants. Hence, as the water flows through\n\nthe marshes, it gets purified naturally.\n\nThe marshes also constitute a sanctuary, with a high level of\n\nbiodiversity in the form of fishes, animals and birds that now reside there.\n\nA citizens group called Friends of the Arcata Marsh (FOAM) are responsible\n\nfor the upkeep and safeguarding of this wonderful project. .\n\nAll this time, we have assumed that removal of wastes requires water,\n\ni.e., the creation of sewage. But what if water is not necessary to dispose\n\noff human waste, like excreta? Can you imagine the amount of water that\n\none can save if one didn’t have to flush the toilet? Well, this is already a\n\nreality. Ecological sanitation is a sustainable system for handling human\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n278\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nexcreta, using dry composting toilets. This is a practical, hygienic, efficient\n\nand cost-effective solution to human waste disposal.  The key point to\n\nnote here is that with this composting method, human excreta can be\n\nrecycled into a resource (as natural fertiliser), which reduces the need for\n\nchemical fertilisers. There are working ‘EcoSan’ toilets in many areas of\n\nKerala and Sri Lanka.\n\n16.3 SOLID WASTES\n\nSolid wastes refer to everything that goes out in trash.  Municipal solid\n\nwastes are wastes from homes, offices, stores, schools, hospitals, etc.,\n\nthat are collected and disposed by the municipality. The municipal solid\n\nwastes generally comprise paper, food wastes, plastics, glass, metals,\n\nrubber, leather, textile, etc. Burning reduces the volume of the wastes,\n\nalthough it is generally not burnt to completion and open dumps often\n\nserve as the breeding ground for rats and flies. Sanitary landfills were\n\nadopted as the substitute for open-burning dumps. In a sanitary landfill,\n\nwastes are dumped in a depression or trench after compaction, and\n\ncovered with dirt everyday. If you live in a town or city, do you know\n\nwhere the nearest landfill site is? Landfills are also not really much of a\n\nsolution since the amount of garbage generation specially in the metros\n\nhas increased so much that these sites are getting filled too. Also there\n\nis danger of seepage of chemicals, etc., from these landfills polluting the\n\nunderground water resources.\n\nA solution to all this can only be in human beings becoming more\n\nsensitive to these environment issues. All waste that we generate can\n\nbe categorised into three types – (a) bio-degradable, (b) recyclable and\n\n(c) the non-biodegradable. It is important that all garbage generated is\n\nsorted. What can be reused or recycled should be separated out; our\n\nkabadiwallahs and rag-pickers do a great job of separation of materials\n\nfor recycling. The biodegradable materials can be put into deep pits in\n\nthe ground and be left for natural breakdown. That leaves only the non-\n\nbiodegradable to be disposed off . The need to reduce our garbage\n\ngeneration should be a prime goal, instead, we are increasing the use of\n\nnon-biodegradable products.  Just pick any readymade packet of any\n\n‘good quality’ eatable, say a biscuit packet, and study the packaging –\n\ndo you see the number of protective layers used? Note that atleast one\n\nlayer is of plastic. We have started packaging even our daily use products\n\nlike milk and water in polybags!! In cities, fruits and vegetables can be\n\nbought packed in beautiful polysterene and plastic packaging – we pay\n\nso much and what do we do? Contribute heavily to environmental\n\npollution. State Governments across the country are trying to push for\n\nreduction in use of plastics and use of eco-friendly packaging. We can do\n\nour bit by carrying cloth or other natural fibre carry-bags when we go\n\nshopping and by refusing polythene bags.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n279\n\nENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES\n\nHospitals generate hazardous wastes that contain disinfectants and\n\nother harmful chemicals, and also pathogenic micro-organisms. Such\n\nwastes also require careful treatment and disposal. The use of incinerators\n\nis crucial to disposal of hospital waste.\n\nIrreparable computers and other electronic goods are known as\n\nelectronic wastes (e-wastes). E-wastes are burried in landfills or\n\nincinerated. Over half of the e-wastes generated in the developed world\n\nare exported to developing countries, mainly to China, India and Pakistan,\n\nwhere metals like copper, iron, silicon, nickel and gold are recovered\n\nduring recycling process. Unlike developed countries, which have\n\nspecifically built facilities for recycling of e-wastes, recycling in developing\n\ncountries often involves manual participation thus exposing workers to\n\ntoxic substances present in e-wastes. Recycling is the only solution for\n\nthe treatment of e-waste, provided it is carried out in an environment-\n\nfriendly manner.\n\n16.3.1 Case Study of Remedy for Plastic Waste\n\nA plastic sack manufacturer in Bangalore has managed to find the ideal\n\nsolution to the ever-increasing problem of accumulating plastic waste.\n\nAhmed Khan, aged 57 years old, has been producing plastic sacks for\n\n20 years. About 8 years ago, he realised that plastic waste was a real\n\nproblem. Polyblend, a fine powder of recycled modified plastic, was\n\ndeveloped then by his company. This mixture is mixed with the bitumen\n\nthat is used to lay roads. In collaboration with R.V.College of Engineering\n\nand the Bangalore City Corporation, Ahmed Khan proved that blends of\n\nPolyblend and bitumen, when used to lay roads, enhanced the bitumen’s\n\nwater repellant properties, and helped to increase road life by a factor of\n\nthree. The raw material for creating Polyblend is any plastic film waste.\n\nSo, against the price of Rs. 0.40 per kg that rag pickers had been getting\n\nfor plastic waste, Khan now offers Rs.6. Using Khan’s technique, by the\n\nyear 2002, more than 40 kms of road in Bangalore has already been\n\nlaid. At this rate, Khan will soon be running short of plastic waste in\n\nBangalore, to produce Polyblend. Thanks to innovations like Polyblend,\n\nwe might still avoid being smothered by plastic waste.\n\n16.4 AGRO-CHEMICALS AND THEIR EFFECTS\n\nIn the wake of green revolution, use of inorganic fertilisers and pesticides\n\nhas increased manifold for enhancing crop production. Pesticides,\n\nherbicides, fungicides, etc., are being increasingly used. These incidentally,\n\nare also toxic to non-target organisms,that are important components of\n\nthe soil ecosystem. Do you think these can be biomagnified in the terrestrial\n\necosystems?  We know what the addition of increasing amounts of\n\nchemical fertilisers can do to aquatic ecosystems vis-à-vis eutrophication.\n\nThe current problems in agriculture are, therefore, extremely grave.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n280\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n16.4.1 Case Study of Organic Farming\n\nIntegrated organic farming is a cyclical, zero-waste procedure, where waste\n\nproducts from one process are cycled in as nutrients for other processes.\n\nThis allows the maximum utilisation of resource and increases the\n\nefficiency of production. Ramesh Chandra Dagar, a farmer in Sonipat,\n\nHaryana, is doing just this. He includes bee-keeping, dairy management,\n\nwater harvesting, composting and agriculture in a chain of processes,\n\nwhich support each other and allow an extremely economical and\n\nsustainable venture. There is no need to use chemical fertilisers for crops,\n\nas cattle excreta (dung) are used as manure. Crop waste is used to create\n\ncompost, which can be used as a natural fertiliser or can be used to\n\ngenerate natural gas for satisfying the energy needs of the farm.\n\nEnthusiastic about spreading information and help on the practice of\n\nintegrated organic farming, Dagar has created the Haryana Kisan Welfare\n\nClub, with a current membership of 5000 farmers.\n\n16.5 RADIOACTIVE WASTES\n\nInitially, nuclear energy was hailed as a non-polluting way for generating\n\nelectricity. Later on, it was realised that the use of nuclear energy has two\n\nvery serious inherent problems. The first is accidental leakage, as occurred\n\nin the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl incidents and the second is safe\n\ndisposal of radioactive wastes.\n\nRadiation, that is given off by nuclear waste is extremely damaging to\n\norganisms, because it causes mutations at a very high rate. At high doses,\n\nnuclear radiation is lethal but at lower doses, it creates various disorders,\n\nthe most frequent of all being cancer. Therefore, nuclear waste is an\n\nextremely potent pollutant and has to be dealt with utmost caution.\n\nIt has been recommended that storage of nuclear waste, after\n\nsufficient pre-treatment, should be done in suitably shielded\n\ncontainers buried within the rocks, about 500 m deep below the\n\nearth’s surface. However, this method of disposal is meeting stiff\n\nopposition from the public. Why do you think this method of\n\ndisposal is not agreeable to many people?\n\n16.6 GREENHOUSE EFFECT AND GLOBAL WARMING\n\nThe term ‘Greenhouse effect’ has been derived from a phenomenon that\n\noccurs in a greenhouse. Have you ever seen a greenhouse? It looks like a\n\nsmall glass house and is used for growing plants especially during winter.\n\nIn a greenhouse the glass panel lets the light in, but does not allow heat\n\nto escape. Therefore, the greenhouse warms up, very much like inside a\n\ncar that has been parked in the sun for a few hours.\n\nThe greenhouse effect  is a naturally occurring phenomenon that is\n\nresponsible for heating of Earth’s surface and atmosphere. You would be\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n281\n\nENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES\n\nsurprised to know that without greenhouse effect the average temperature\n\nat surface of Earth would have been a chilly –18oC rather than the present\n\naverage of 15oC. In order to understand the\n\ngreenhouse effect, it is necessary to know the\n\nfate of the energy of sunlight that reaches the\n\noutermost atmosphere (Figure16.6). Clouds\n\nand gases reflect about one-fourth of the\n\nincoming solar radiation, and absorb some of\n\nit but almost half of incoming solar radiation\n\nfalls on Earth’s surface heating it, while a small\n\nproportion is reflected back. Earth’s surface\n\nre-emits heat in the form of infrared radiation\n\nbut part of this does not escape into space as\n\natmospheric gases (e.g., carbon dioxide,\n\nmethane, etc.) absorb a major fraction of it. The\n\nmolecules of these gases radiate heat energy,\n\nand a major part of which again comes to\n\nEarth’s surface, thus heating it up once again.\n\nThis cycle is repeated many a times. The\n\nabove-mentioned gases – carbon dioxide and methane – are commonly\n\nknown as greenhouse gases (Figure 16.7) because they are responsible\n\nfor the greenhouse effect.\n\nIncrease in the level of greenhouse gases has led to considerable heating\n\nof Earth leading to global warming. During the past century, the\n\ntemperature of Earth has increased by 0.6 oC, most of it during the last\n\nFigure 16.7 Relative contribution of various\ngreenhouse gases to total global\nwarming\n\nFigure 16.6 Sunlight energy at the outermost atmosphere\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n282\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nFigure 16.8 Ozone hole is the area above\nAntarctica, shown in purple\ncolour, where the ozone layer\nis the thinnest. Ozone\nthickness is given in Dobson\nunit (see carefully the scale\nshown in colour violet to red).\nThe ozone hole over Antarctica\ndevelops each year between\nlate August and early\nOctober. Courtesy: NASA\n\nthree decades. Scientists believe that this rise in temperature is leading\n\nto deleterious changes in the environment and resulting in odd climatic\n\nchanges (e.g. El Nino effect) , thus leading to increased melting of polar\n\nice caps as well as of other places like the Himalayan snow caps. Over\n\nmany years, this will result in a rise in sea level that can submerge many\n\ncoastal areas. The total spectrum of changes that global warming can\n\nbring about is a subject that is still under active research.\n\nHow can we control global warming? The measures include cutting\n\ndown use of fossil fuel, improving efficiency of energy usage, reducing\n\ndeforestation, planting trees and slowing down the growth of human\n\npopulation. International initiatives are also being taken to reduce the\n\nemission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.\n\n16.7 OZONE DEPLETION IN THE STRATO-\n\nSPHERE\n\nYou have earlier studied in the Chemistry\n\ntextbook of Class XI about ‘bad’ ozone, formed\n\nin the lower atmosphere (troposphere) that harms\n\nplants and animals. There is ‘good’ ozone also;\n\nthis ozone is found in the upper part of the\n\natmosphere called the stratosphere, and it acts\n\nas a shield absorbing ultraviolet radiation from\n\nthe sun. UV rays are highly injurious to living\n\norganisms since DNA and proteins of living\n\norganisms preferentially absorb UV rays, and its\n\nhigh energy breaks the chemical bonds within\n\nthese molecules. The thickness of the ozone in a\n\ncolumn of air from the ground to the top of the\n\natmosphere is measured in terms of Dobson\n\nunits (DU).\n\nOzone gas is continuously formed by the\n\naction of UV rays on molecular oxygen, and also\n\ndegraded into molecular oxygen in the\n\nstratosphere. There should be a balance between\n\nproduction and degradation of ozone in the\n\nstratosphere. Of late, the balance has been\n\ndisrupted due to enhancement of ozone\n\ndegradation by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).\n\nCFCs find wide use as refrigerants. CFCs discharged in the lower part of\n\natmosphere move upward and reach stratosphere. In stratosphere, UV\n\nrays act on them releasing Cl atoms. Cl degrades ozone releasing\n\nmolecular oxygen, with these atoms acting merely as catalysts; Cl atoms\n\nare not consumed in the reaction. Hence, whatever CFCs are added to\n\nthe stratosphere, they have permanent and continuing effects on Ozone\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n283\n\nENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES\n\nlevels.  Although ozone depletion is occurring widely in the stratosphere,\n\nthe depletion is particularly marked over the Antarctic region. This has\n\nresulted in formation of a large area of thinned ozone layer, commonly\n\ncalled as the ozone hole (Figure 16.8).\n\nUV radiation of wavelengths shorter than UV-B, are almost completely\n\nabsorbed by Earth’s atmosphere, given that the ozone layer is intact. But,\n\nUV-B damages DNA and mutation may occur. It causes aging of skin,\n\ndamage to skin cells and various types of skin cancers. In human eye,\n\ncornea absorbs UV-B radiation, and a high dose of UV-B causes\n\ninflammation of cornea, called snow-blindness, cataract, etc. Such\n\nexposure may permanently damage the cornea.\n\nRecognising the deleterious affects of ozone depletion, an international\n\ntreaty, known as the Montreal Protocol, was signed at Montreal (Canada)\n\nin 1987 (effective in 1989) to control the emission of ozone depleting\n\nsubstances. Subsequently many more efforts have been made and\n\nprotocols have laid down definite roadmaps, separately for developed and\n\ndeveloping countries, for reducing the emission of CFCs and other ozone\n\ndepleting chemicals.\n\n16.8 DEGRADATION BY IMPROPER RESOURCE UTILISATION\nAND MAINTENANCE\n\nThe degradation of natural resources can occur, not just by the action of\n\npollutants but also by improper resource utilisation practices.\n\nSoil erosion and desertification: The development of the fertile top-soil\n\ntakes centuries. But, it can be removed very easily due to human activities\n\nlike over-cultivation, unrestricted grazing, deforestation and poor\n\nirrigation practices, resulting in arid patches of land. When large barren\n\npatches extend and meet over time, a desert is created. Internationally, it\n\nhas been recognised that desertification is a major problem nowadays,\n\nparticularly due to increased urbanisation.\n\nWaterlogging and soil salinity: Irrigation without proper drainage of\n\nwater leads to waterlogging in the soil. Besides affecting the crops,\n\nwaterlogging draws salt to the surface of the soil. The salt then is deposited\n\nas a thin crust on the land surface or starts collecting at the roots of the\n\nplants. This increased salt content is inimical to the growth of crops and\n\nis extremely damaging to agriculture. Waterlogging and soil salinity are\n\nsome of the problems that have come in the wake of the Green Revolution.\n\n16.9 DEFORESTATION\n\nDeforestation is the conversion of forested areas to non-forested ones.\n\nAccording to an estimate, almost 40 per cent forests have been lost in the\n\ntropics, compared to only 1 per cent in the temperate region. The present\n\nscenario of deforestation is particularly grim in India. At the beginning of\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n284\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nthe twentieth century, forests covered about 30 per cent of the land of\n\nIndia. By the end of the century, it shrunk to 21.54 per cent, whereas the\n\nNational Forest Policy (1988) of India has recommended 33 per cent forest\n\ncover for the plains and 67 per cent for the hills.\n\nHow does deforestation occur? A number of human activities\n\ncontribute to it. One of the major reasons is the conversion of forest to\n\nagricultural land so as to feed the growing human population. Trees are\n\naxed for timber, firewood, cattle ranching and for several other purposes.\n\nSlash and burn agriculture, commonly called as Jhum cultivation in\n\nthe north-eastern states of India, has also contributed to deforestation.\n\nIn slash and burn agriculture, the farmers cut down the trees of the forest\n\nand burn the plant remains. The ash is used as a fertiliser and the land is\n\nthen used for farming or cattle grazing. After cultivation, the area is left\n\nfor several years so as to allow its recovery. The farmers then move on to\n\nother areas and repeat this process. In earlier days, when Jhum cultivation\n\nwas in prevalence, enough time-gap was given so that the land recovered\n\nfrom the effect of cultivation. With increasing population, and repeated\n\ncultivation, this recovery phase is done away with, resulting in\n\ndeforestation.\n\nWhat are the consequences of deforestation? One of the major effects\n\nis enhanced carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere because\n\ntrees that could hold a lot of carbon in their biomass are lost with\n\ndeforestation. Deforestation also causes loss of biodiversity due to habitat\n\ndestruction, disturbs hydrologic cycle, causes soil erosion, and may lead\n\nto desertification in extreme cases.\n\nReforestation is the process of restoring a forest that once existed\n\nbut was removed at some point of time in the past. Reforestation may\n\noccur naturally in a deforested area. However, we can speed it up by\n\nplanting trees with due consideration to biodiversity that earlier existed\n\nin that area.\n\n16.9.1 Case Study of People’s Participation in\nConservation of Forests\n\nPeople’s participation has a long history in India. In 1731, the king of\n\nJodhpur in Rajasthan asked one of his ministers to arrange wood for\n\nconstructing a new palace. The minister and workers went to a forest\n\nnear a village, inhabited by Bishnois, to cut down trees. The Bishnoi\n\ncommunity is known for its peaceful co-existence with nature. The effort\n\nto cut down trees by the kings was thwarted by the Bishnois. A Bishnoi\n\nwoman Amrita Devi showed exemplary courage by hugging a tree and\n\ndaring king’s men to cut her first before cutting the tree. The tree mattered\n\nmuch more to her than her own life. Sadly, the king’s men did not heed to\n\nher pleas, and cut down the tree along with Amrita Devi. Her three\n\ndaughters and hundreds of other Bishnois followed her, and thus lost\n\ntheir lives saving trees. Nowhere in history do we find a commitment of\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n285\n\nENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES\n\nSUMMARY\n\nMajor issues relating to environmental pollution and depletion of\n\nvaluable natural resources vary in dimension from local, regional to\n\nglobal levels. Air pollution primarily results from burning of fossil fuel,\n\ne.g., coal and petroleum, in industries and in automobiles. They are\n\nharmful to humans, animals and plants, and therefore must be removed\n\nto keep our air clean. Domestic sewage, the most common source of\n\npollution of water bodies, reduces dissolved oxygen but increases\n\nbiochemical oxygen demand of receiving water. Domestic sewage is rich\n\nin nutrients, especially, nitrogen and phosphorus, which cause\n\neutrophication and nuisance creating algal blooms. Industrial waste\n\nwaters are often rich in toxic chemicals, especially heavy metals and\n\norganic compounds. Industrial waste waters harm living organisms.\n\nMunicipal solid wastes also create problems and must be disposed off\n\nin landfills. Disposal of hazardous wastes like defunct ships, radioactive\n\nwastes and e-wastes requires additional efforts. Soil pollution primarily\n\nresults from agricultural chemicals (e.g., pesticides) and leachates from\n\nsolid wastes deposited over it.\n\nTwo major environmental issues of global nature are increasing\n\ngreenhouse effect, which is warming Earth, and depletion of ozone in\n\nthe stratosphere. Enhanced greenhouse effect is mainly due to\n\nincreased emission of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and CFCs.,\n\nand also due to deforestation. It may drastically change rainfall pattern,\n\nglobal temperature, besides deleteriously affecting living organisms.\n\nOzone in the stratosphere, which protects us from harmful effects of\n\nultraviolet radiation, is depleting fast due to emission of CFCs thus\n\nincreasing the risks of skin cancer, mutation and other disorders.\n\nthis magnitude when human beings sacrificed their lives for the cause of\n\nthe environment. The Government of India has recently instituted the\n\nAmrita Devi Bishnoi Wildlife Protection Award for individuals or\n\ncommunities from rural areas that have shown extraordinary courage\n\nand dedication in protecting wildlife.\n\nYou may have heard of the Chipko Movement of Garhwal Himalayas.\n\nIn 1974, local women showed enormous bravery in protecting trees from\n\nthe axe of contractors by hugging them. People all over the world have\n\nacclaimed the Chipko movement.\n\nRealising the significance of participation by local communities,\n\nthe Government of India in 1980s has introduced the concept of\n\nJoint Forest Management (JFM) so as to work closely with the local\n\ncommunities for protecting and managing forests. In return for their\n\nservices to the forest, the communities get benefit of various forest products\n\n(e.g., fruits, gum, rubber, medicine, etc.), and thus the forest can be\n\nconserved in a sustainable manner.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n286\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nEXERCISES\n1.
