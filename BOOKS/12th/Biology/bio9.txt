Several new techniques like embryo\n\ntransfer technology and tissue culture techniques are going\n\nto play a pivotal role in further enhancing food production.\n\n9.1 ANIMAL HUSBANDRY\n\nAnimal husbandry is the agricultural practice of breeding\n\nand raising livestock. As such it is a vital skill for farmers\n\nand is as much science as it is art.  Animal husbandry\n\ndeals with the care and breeding of livestock like buffaloes,\n\ncows, pigs, horses, cattle, sheep, camels, goats, etc., that\n\nare useful to humans. Extended, it includes poultry\n\nfarming and fisheries. Fisheries include rearing, catching,\n\nselling, etc., of fish, molluscs (shell-fish) and crustaceans\n\n(prawns, crabs, etc.). Since time immemorial, animals like\n\nbees, silk-worm, prawns, crabs, fishes, birds, pigs, cattle,\n\nsheep and camels have been used by humans for products\n\nlike milk, eggs, meat, wool, silk, honey, etc.\n\nIt is estimated that more then 70 per cent of the world\n\nlivestock population is in India and China.  However, it is\n\nCHAPTER 9\n\nSTRATEGIES FOR ENHANCEMENT\n\nIN FOOD PRODUCTION\n\n9.1 Animal Husbandry\n\n9.2 Plant Breeding\n\n9.3 Single Cell Proteins\n\n9.4 Tissue Culture\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n166\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nsurprising to note that the contribution to the world farm produce is only\n\n25 per cent, i.e., the productivity per unit is very low. Hence, in addition\n\nto conventional practices of animal breeding and care, newer technologies\n\nalso have to be applied to achieve improvement in quality and productivity.\n\n9.1.1 Management of Farms and Farm Animals\n\nA professional approach to what have been traditional practices of farm\n\nmanagement gives the much needed boost to our food production. Let us\n\ndiscuss some of the management procedures, employed in various animal\n\nfarm systems.\n\n9.1.1.1 Dairy Farm Management\n\nDairying is the management of animals for milk and its products for\n\nhuman consumption.  Can you list the animals that you would expect\n\nto find in a dairy? What are different kinds of products that can be\n\nmade with milk from a dairy farm?  In dairy farm management, we deal\n\nwith processes and systems that increase yield and improve quality of\n\nmilk.  Milk yield is primarily dependent on the quality of breeds in the\n\nfarm. Selection of good breeds having high yielding potential (under the\n\nclimatic conditions of the area), combined with resistance to diseases is\n\nvery important. For the yield potential to be realised the cattle have to be\n\nwell looked after – they have to be housed well, should have adequate\n\nwater and be maintained disease free. The feeding of cattle should be\n\ncarried out in a scientific manner – with special emphasis on the quality\n\nand quantity of fodder.  Besides, stringent cleanliness and hygiene (both\n\nof the cattle and the handlers) are of paramount importance while milking,\n\nstorage and transport of the milk and its products. Nowadays, of course,\n\nmuch of these processes have become mechanised, which reduces chance\n\nof direct contact of the produce with the handler. Ensuring these stringent\n\nmeasures would of course, require regular inspections, with proper record\n\nkeeping. It would also help to identify and rectify the problems as early\n\nas possible. Regular visits by a veterinary doctor would be  mandatory.\n\nYou would probably find it interesting if you were to prepare a\n\nquestionnaire on diverse aspects of dairy keeping and then follow it up with\n\na visit to a dairy farm in your locality and seek answers to the questions.\n\n9.1.1.2 Poultry Farm Management\n\nPoultry is the class of domesticated fowl (birds) used for food or for their\n\neggs.  They typically include chicken and ducks, and sometimes turkey and\n\ngeese.  The word poultry is often used to refer to the meat of only these birds,\n\nbut in a more general sense it may refer to the meat of other birds too.\n\nAs in dairy farming, selection of disease free and suitable breeds,\n\nproper and safe farm conditions, proper feed and water, and hygiene and\n\nhealth care are important components of poultry farm management.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nSTRATEGIES FOR ENHANCEMENT IN FOOD PRODUCTION\n\n167\n\nYou may have seen TV news or read newspaper–\n\nreports about the ‘bird flu virus’ which created a scare in\n\nthe country and drastically affected egg and chicken\n\nconsumption.  Find out more about it and discuss whether\n\nthe panic reaction was justified. How can we prevent the\n\nspread of the flu in case some chicken are infected?\n\n9.1.2 Animal Breeding\n\nBreeding of animals is an important aspect of animal\n\nhusbandry.  Animal breeding aims at increasing the yield\n\nof animals and improving the desirable qualities of the\n\nproduce. For what kind of characters would we breed\n\nanimals? Would the selection of characters differ with\n\nthe choice of animals?\n\nWhat do we understand by the term ‘breed’?  A group\n\nof animals related by descent and similar in most characters\n\nlike general appearance, features, size, configuration, etc.,\n\nare said to belong to a breed. Find out the names of some\n\ncommon breeds of cattle and poultry in the farms of your\n\narea.\n\nWhen breeding is between animals of the same breed it\n\nis called inbreeding, while crosses between different breeds\n\nare called outbreeding.\n\nInbreeding : Inbreeding refers to the mating of more\n\nclosely related individuals within the same breed for 4-\n\n6 generations. The breeding strategy is as follows – superior males and\n\nsuperior females of the same breed are identified and mated in pairs.\n\nThe progeny obtained from such matings are evaluated and superior\n\nmales and females among them are identified for further mating. A\n\nsuperior female, in the case of cattle, is the cow or buffalo that produces\n\nmore milk per lactation. On the other hand, a superior male is the bull,\n\nwhich gives rise to superior progeny as compared to those of other\n\nmales.\n\nTry to recollect the homozygous purelines developed by Mendel as\n\ndiscussed in Chapter 5. A similar strategy is used for developing purelines\n\nin cattle as was used in case of peas. Inbreeding increases homozygosity.\n\nThus inbreeding is necessary if we want to evolve a pureline in any animal.\n\nInbreeding exposes harmful recessive genes that are eliminated by selection.\n\nIt also helps in accumulation of superior genes and elimination of less\n\ndesirable genes. Therefore, this approach, where there is selection at each\n\nstep, increases the productivity of inbred population. However, continued\n\ninbreeding, especially close inbreeding, usually reduces fertility and even\n\nproductivity. This is called inbreeding depression.  Whenever this becomes\n\na problem, selected animals of the breeding population should be mated\n\nFigure 9.1 Improved breed of\ncattle and chickens\n(a) Jersey (b) Leghorn\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n168\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nwith unrelated superior animals of the same breed. This usually helps\n\nrestore fertility and yield.\n\nOut-breeding : Out-breeding is the breeding of the unrelated animals,\n\nwhich may be between individuals of the same breed but having no\n\ncommon ancestors for 4-6 generations (out-crossing) or between\n\ndifferent breeds (cross-breeding) or different species (inter-specific\n\nhybridisation).\n\nOut-crossing: This is the practice of mating of animals within the same\n\nbreed, but having no common ancestors on either side of their pedigree\n\nup to 4-6 generations. The offspring of such a mating is known as an\n\nout-cross. It is the best breeding method for animals that are below\n\naverage in productivity in milk production, growth rate in beef cattle,\n\netc. A single outcross often helps to overcome inbreeding depression.\n\nCross-breeding: In this method, superior males of one breed are mated\n\nwith superior females of another breed. Cross-breeding allows the\n\ndesirable qualities of two different breeds to be combined. The progeny\n\nhybrid animals may themselves be used for commercial production.\n\nAlternatively, they may be subjected to some form of inbreeding and\n\nselection to develop new stable breeds that may be superior to the existing\n\nbreeds. Many new animal breeds have been developed by this approach.\n\nHisardale is a new breed of sheep developed in Punjab by crossing\n\nBikaneri ewes and Marino rams.\n\nInterspecific hybridisation: In this method, male and female animals\n\nof two different related species are mated. In some cases, the progeny\n\nmay combine desirable features of both the parents, and may be of\n\nconsiderable economic value, e.g., the mule (Figure 9.2). Do you know\n\nwhat cross leads to the production of the mule?\n\nControlled breeding experiments are carried out using artificial\n\ninsemination.  The semen is collected from the male that\n\nis chosen as a parent and injected into the reproductive\n\ntract of the selected female by the breeder.  The semen\n\nmay be used immediately or can be frozen and used at a\n\nlater date. It can also be transported in a frozen form to\n\nwhere the female is housed. In this way desirable matings\n\nare carried. Artificial insemination helps us overcome\n\nseveral problems of normal matings.  Can you discuss\n\nand list some of them?\n\nOften, the success rate of crossing mature male and\n\nfemale animals is fairly low even though artificial\n\ninsemination is carried out.  To improve chances of\n\nsuccessful production of hybrids, other means are also used. Multiple\n\nOvulation Embryo Transfer Technology (MOET) is one such\n\nprogramme for herd improvement.  In this method, a cow is administered\n\nhormones, with FSH-like activity, to induce follicular maturation and super\n\novulation – instead of one egg, which they normally yield per cycle, they\n\nFigure 9.2 Mule\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nSTRATEGIES FOR ENHANCEMENT IN FOOD PRODUCTION\n\n169\n\nproduce 6-8 eggs. The animal is either mated with an elite bull or\n\nartificially inseminated. The fertilised eggs at 8–32 cells stages, are\n\nrecovered non-surgically and transferred to surrogate mothers. The genetic\n\nmother is available for another round of super ovulation. This technology\n\nhas been demonstrated for cattle, sheep, rabbits, buffaloes, mares, etc.\n\nHigh milk-yielding breeds of females and high quality (lean meat with\n\nless lipid) meat-yielding bulls have been bred successfully to increase\n\nherd size in a short time.\n\n9.1.3 Bee-keeping\n\nBee-keeping or apiculture is the maintenance of hives of honeybees for\n\nthe production of honey. It has been an age-old cottage industry. Honey\n\nis a food of high nutritive value and also finds use in the indigenous\n\nsystems of medicine.  Honeybee also produces beeswax, which finds many\n\nuses in industry, such as in the preparation of cosmetics and polishes of\n\nvarious kinds. The increased demand of honey has led to large-scale bee-\n\nkeeping practices; it has become an established income generating\n\nindustry, whether practiced on a small or on a large scale.\n\nBee-keeping can be practiced in any area where there are sufficient\n\nbee pastures of some wild shrubs, fruit orchards and cultivated crops.\n\nThere are several species of honeybees which can be reared. Of these, the\n\nmost common species is Apis indica. Beehives can be kept in one’s\n\ncourtyard, on the verandah of the house or even on the roof. Bee-keeping\n\nis not labour-intensive.\n\nBee-keeping though relatively easy does require some specialised\n\nknowledge and there are several organisations that teach bee-keeping.\n\nThe following points are important for successful bee-keeping:\n\n(i) Knowledge of the nature and habits of bees,\n\n(ii) Selection of suitable location for keeping the beehives,\n\n(iii) Catching and hiving of swarms (group of bees),\n\n(iv) Management of beehives during different seasons, and\n\n(v) Handling and collection of honey and of beeswax. Bees are the pollinators\n\nof many of our crop species (see chapter 2) such as sunflower, Brassica,\n\napple and pear. Keeping beehives in crop fields during flowering period\n\nincreases pollination efficiency and improves the yield–beneficial both\n\nfrom the point of view of crop yield and honey yield.\n\n9.1.4 Fisheries\n\nFishery is an industry devoted to the catching, processing or selling of fish,\n\nshellfish or other aquatic animals. A large number of our population is\n\ndependent on fish, fish products and other aquatic animals such as prawn,\n\ncrab, lobster, edible oyster, etc., for food. Some of the freshwater fishes which\n\nare very common include Catla, Rohu and common carp. Some of the marine\n\nfishes that are eaten include – Hilsa, Sardines, Mackerel and Pomfrets.\n\nFind out what fishes are commonly eaten in your area.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n170\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nFisheries has an important place in Indian economy. It provides income\n\nand employment to millions of fishermen and farmers, particularly in the\n\ncoastal states.  For many, it is the only source of their livelihood. In order\n\nto meet the increasing demands on fisheries, different techniques have\n\nbeen employed to increase production. For example, through aquaculture\n\nand pisciculture we have been able to increase the production of aquatic\n\nplants and animals, both fresh-water and marine. Find out the difference\n\nbetween pisciculture and aquaculture. This has led to the development\n\nand flourishing of the fishery industry, and it has brought a lot of income\n\nto the farmers in particular and the country in general. We now talk about\n\n‘Blue Revolution’ as being implemented along the same lines as ‘Green\n\nRevolution’.\n\n9.2 PLANT BREEDING\n\nTraditional farming can only yield a limited biomass, as food for humans\n\nand animals. Better management practices and increase in acreage can\n\nincrease yield, but only to a limited extent. Plant breeding as a technology\n\nhas helped increase yields to a very large extent. Who in India has not\n\nheard of Green Revolution which was responsible for our country to\n\nnot merely meet the national requirements in food production but also\n\nhelped us even to export it?  Green revolution was dependent to a large\n\nextent on plant breeding techniques for development of high-yielding and\n\ndisease resistant varieties in wheat, rice, maize, etc.\n\n9.2.1 What is Plant Breeding?\n\nPlant breeding is the purposeful manipulation of plant species in order to\n\ncreate desired plant types that are better suited for cultivation, give better\n\nyields and are disease resistant. Conventional plant breeding has been\n\npracticed for thousands of years, since the beginning of human civilisation;\n\nrecorded evidence of plant breeding dates back to 9,000-11,000 years ago.\n\nMany present-day crops are the result of domestication in ancient times.\n\nToday, all our major food crops are derived from domesticated varieties.\n\nClassical plant breeding involves crossing or hybridisation of pure lines,\n\nfollowed by artificial selection to produce plants with desirable traits of higher\n\nyield, nutrition and resistance to diseases. With advancements in genetics,\n\nmolecular biology and tissue culture, plant breeding is now increasingly\n\nbeing carried out by using molecular genetic tools.\n\nIf we were to list the traits or characters that the breeders have tried to\n\nincorporate into crop plants, the first we would list would be increased\n\ncrop yield and improved quality.  Increased tolerance to environmental\n\nstresses (salinity, extreme temperatures, drought), resistance to pathogens\n\n(viruses, fungi and bacteria) and  increased tolerance to insect pests would\n\nbe on our list too.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nSTRATEGIES FOR ENHANCEMENT IN FOOD PRODUCTION\n\n171\n\nPlant breeding programmes are carried out in a systematic way\n\nworldwide–in government institutions and commercial companies.  The\n\nmain steps in breeding a new genetic variety of a crop are –\n\n(i) Collection of variability: Genetic variability is the root of any\n\nbreeding programme. In many crops pre-existing genetic variability\n\nis available from wild relatives of the crop. Collection and preservation\n\nof all the different wild varieties, species and  relatives of the cultivated\n\nspecies (followed by their evaluation for their characteristics) is a\n\npre-requisite for effective exploitation of natural genes available in\n\nthe populations. The entire collection (of plants/seeds) having all\n\nthe diverse alleles for all genes in a given crop is called germplasm\n\ncollection.\n\n(ii) Evaluation and selection of parents: The germplasm is evaluated\n\nso as to identify plants with desirable combination of characters.\n\nThe selected plants are multiplied and used in the process of\n\nhybridisation. Purelines are created wherever desirable and possible.\n\n(iii) Cross hybridisation among the selected parents: The desired\n\ncharacters have very often to be combined from two different plants\n\n(parents), for example high protein quality of one parent may need\n\nto be combined with disease resistance from another parent. This is\n\npossible by cross hybridising the two parents to produce hybrids\n\nthat  genetically combine the desired characters in one plant. This is\n\na very time-consuming and tedious process since the pollen\n\ngrains from the desirable plant chosen as male parent have to be\n\ncollected and placed on the stigma of the flowers selected as female\n\nparent (In chapter 2 details on how to make crosses have been\n\ndescribed).  Also, it is not necessary that the hybrids do combine the\n\ndesirable characters; usually only one in few hundred to a thousand\n\ncrosses shows the desirable combination.\n\n(iv) Selection and testing of superior recombinants: This step\n\nconsists of selecting, among the progeny of the hybrids, those plants\n\nthat have the desired character combination. The selection process is\n\ncrucial to the success of the breeding objective and requires careful\n\nscientific evaluation of the progeny. This step yields plants that are\n\nsuperior to both of the parents (very often more than one superior\n\nprogeny plant may become available). These are self-pollinated for\n\nseveral generations till they reach a state of uniformity (homozygosity),\n\nso that the characters will not segregate in the progeny.\n\n(v) Testing, release and commercialisation of new cultivars: The\n\nnewly selected lines are evaluated for their yield and other agronomic\n\ntraits of quality, disease resistance, etc. This evaluation is done by\n\ngrowing these in the research fields and recording their performance\n\nunder ideal fertiliser application, irrigation, and other crop\n\nmanagement practices. The evaluation in research fields is followed\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n172\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nby testing the materials in farmers’ fields, for at least three growing\n\nseasons at several locations in the country, representing all the\n\nagroclimatic zones where the crop is usually grown. The material is\n\nevaluated in comparison to the best available local crop cultivar – a\n\ncheck or reference cultivar.\n\nIndia is mainly an agricultural country. Agriculture accounts\n\nfor approximately 33 per cent of India’s GDP and employs nearly\n\n62 per cent of the population. After India’s independence, one of the main\n\nchallenges facing the country was that of producing enough food for the\n\nincreasing population. As only limited land is fit for cultivation, India has\n\nto strive to increase yields per unit area from existing farm land. The\n\ndevelopment of several high yielding varieties of wheat and rice in the\n\nmid-1960s, as a result of various plant breeding techniques led to dramatic\n\nincrease in food production in our country.  This phase is often referred\n\nto as the Green Revolution. Figure 9.3 represents some Indian hybrid\n\ncrops of high yeilding varieties.\n\n(c)\n\n(b)(a)\n\nFigure 9.3 Some Indian hybrid crops: (a) Maize; (b) Wheat; (c) Garden peas\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nSTRATEGIES FOR ENHANCEMENT IN FOOD PRODUCTION\n\n173\n\nWheat and Rice: During the period 1960 to 2000, wheat production\n\nincreased from 11 million tonnes to 75 million tonnes while rice production\n\nwent up from 35 million tonnes to 89.5 million tonnes. This was due to the\n\ndevelopment of semi-dwarf varieties of wheat and rice. Nobel laureate\n\nNorman E. Borlaug, at International Centre for Wheat and Maize\n\nImprovement in Mexico, developed semi-dwarf wheat. In 1963, several\n\nvarieties such as Sonalika and Kalyan Sona, which were high yielding and\n\ndisease resistant, were introduced all over the wheat-growing belt of India.\n\nSemi-dwarf rice varieties were derived from IR-8, (developed at International\n\nRice Research Institute (IRRI), Philippines) and Taichung Native-1 (from\n\nTaiwan). The derivatives were introduced in 1966. Later  better-yielding semi-\n\ndwarf varieties Jaya and Ratna were developed in India.\n\nSugar cane: Saccharum barberi was originally grown in north India, but\n\nhad poor sugar content and yield. Tropical canes grown in south India\n\nSaccharum officinarum had thicker stems and higher sugar content but\n\ndid not grow well in north India. These two species were successfully\n\ncrossed to get sugar cane varieties combining the desirable qualities of\n\nhigh yield, thick stems, high sugar and ability to grow in the sugar cane\n\nareas of north India.\n\nMillets:  Hybrid maize, jowar and bajra have been successfully developed\n\nin India. Hybrid breeding have led to the development of several high\n\nyielding varieties resistant to water stress.\n\n9.2.2 Plant Breeding for Disease Resistance\n\nA wide range of fungal, bacterial and viral pathogens, affect the yield of\n\ncultivated crop species, especially in tropical climates. Crop losses can\n\noften be significant, up to 20-30 per cent, or sometimes even total. In this\n\nsituation, breeding and development of cultivars resistant to disease\n\nenhances food production. This also helps reduce the dependence on\n\nuse of  fungicides and bacteriocides. Resistance of the host plant is the\n\nability to prevent the pathogen from causing disease and is determined\n\nby the genetic constitution of the host plant. Before breeding is\n\nundertaken, it is important to know about the causative organism and\n\nthe mode of transmission. Some of the diseases caused by fungi are rusts,\n\ne.g., brown rust of wheat, red rot of sugarcane and late blight of potato;\n\nby  bacteria – black rot of crucifers; and by viruses – tobacco mosaic,\n\nturnip mosaic, etc.\n\nMethods of breeding for disease resistance: Breeding is carried\n\nout by the conventional breeding techniques (described earlier) or by\n\nmutation breeding. The conventional method of breeding for disease\n\nresistance is that of hybridisation and selection. It’s steps are essentially\n\nidentical to those for breeding for any other agronomic characters such\n\nas high yield. The various sequential steps are : screening germplasm\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n174\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nfor resistance sources, hybridisation of selected parents, selection and\n\nevaluation of the hybrids and testing and release of new varieties.\n\nSome crop varieties bred by hybridisation and selection, for\n\ndisease resistance to fungi, bacteria and viral diseases are released\n\n(Table 9.1).\n\nTable 9.1\n\nCrop Variety Resistance to diseases\n\nWheat Himgiri Leaf and stripe rust, hill bunt\n\nBrassica Pusa swarnim White rust\n\n(Karan rai)\n\nCauliflower Pusa Shubhra, Black rot and Curl\n\nPusa Snowball K-1 blight black rot\n\nCowpea Pusa Komal Bacterial blight\n\nChilli Pusa Sadabahar Chilly mosaic virus,\n\nTobacco mosaic virus\n\nand Leaf curl\n\nConventional breeding is often constrained by the availability of limited\n\nnumber of disease resistance genes that are present and identified in various\n\ncrop varieties or wild relatives.  Inducing mutations in plants through diverse\n\nmeans and then screening the plant materials for resistance sometimes\n\nleads to desirable genes being identified.  Plants having these desirable\n\ncharacters can then be either multiplied directly or can be used in breeding.\n\nOther breeding methods that are used are selection amongst somaclonal\n\nvariants and genetic engineering.\n\nMutation is the process by which genetic variations are created\n\nthrough changes in the base sequence within genes (see Chapter 5)\n\nresulting in the creation of a new character or trait not found in the parental\n\ntype. It is possible to induce mutations artificially through use of chemicals\n\nor radiations (like gamma radiations), and selecting and using the plants\n\nthat have the desirable character as a source in breeding – this process is\n\ncalled mutation breeding. In mung bean, resistance to yellow mosaic\n\nvirus and powdery mildew were induced by mutations.\n\nSeveral wild relatives of different cultivated species of plants have been\n\nshown to have certain resistant characters but have very low yield.  Hence,\n\nthere is a need to introduce the resistant genes into the high-yielding\n\ncultivated varieties. Resistance to yellow mosaic virus in bhindi\n\n(Abelmoschus esculentus) was transferred from a wild species and\n\nresulted in a new variety of A. esculentus called Parbhani kranti.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nSTRATEGIES FOR ENHANCEMENT IN FOOD PRODUCTION\n\n175\n\nAll the above examples involve sources of resistance genes that are in\n\nthe same crop species, which has to be bred for disease resistance, or in a\n\nrelated wild species. Transfer of resistance genes is achieved by sexual\n\nhybridisation between the target and the source plant followed by\n\nselection.\n\n9.2.3 Plant Breeding for Developing Resistance\nto Insect Pests\n\nAnother major cause for large scale destruction of crop plant and crop\n\nproduce is insect and pest infestation. Insect resistance in host crop plants\n\nmay be due to morphological, biochemical or physiological characteristics.\n\nHairy leaves in several plants are associated with resistance to insect pests,\n\ne.g, resistance to jassids in cotton and cereal leaf beetle in wheat. In wheat,\n\nsolid stems lead to non-preference by the stem sawfly and smooth leaved\n\nand nectar-less cotton varieties do not attract bollworms. High aspartic\n\nacid, low nitrogen and sugar content in maize leads to resistance to maize\n\nstem borers.\n\nBreeding methods for insect pest resistance involve the same steps as\n\nthose for any other agronomic trait such as yield or quality and are as\n\ndiscussed earlier. Sources of resistance genes may be  cultivated varieties,\n\ngermplasm collections of the crop or wild relatives.\n\nSome released crop varieties bred by hybridisation and selection, for\n\ninsect pest resistance are given in Table 9.2.\n\nTable 9.2\n\nCrop Variety Insect Pests\n\nBrassica Pusa Gaurav Aphids\n\n(rapeseed mustard)\n\nFlat bean Pusa Sem 2, Jassids, aphids and\n\nPusa Sem 3 fruit borer\n\nOkra (Bhindi) Pusa Sawani Shoot and Fruit borer\n\nPusa A-4\n\n9.2.4 Plant Breeding for Improved Food Quality\n\nMore than 840 million people in the world do not have adequate food to\n\nmeet their daily food and nutritional requirements. A far greater number–\n\nthree billion people – suffer from micronutrient, protein and vitamin\n\ndeficiencies or ‘hidden hunger’ because they cannot afford to buy enough\n\nfruits, vegetables, legumes, fish and meat. Diets lacking essential\n\nmicronutrients – particularly  iron, vitamin A, iodine and zinc – increase\n\nthe risk for disease, reduce lifespan and reduce mental abilities.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n176\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nBiofortification – breeding crops with higher levels of vitamins and\n\nminerals, or higher protein and healthier fats – is the most practical\n\nmeans to improve public health.\n\nBreeding for improved nutritional quality is undertaken with the\n\nobjectives of improving –\n\n(i) Protein content and quality;\n\n(ii) Oil content and quality;\n\n(iii) Vitamin content; and\n\n(iv) Micronutrient and mineral content.\n\nIn 2000, maize hybrids that had twice the amount of the amino acids,\n\nlysine and tryptophan, compared to existing maize hybrids were\n\ndeveloped. Wheat variety, Atlas 66, having a high protein content, has\n\nbeen used as a donor for improving cultivated wheat.  It has been possible\n\nto develop an iron-fortified rice variety containing over five times as much\n\niron as in commonly consumed varieties.\n\nThe Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi has also released\n\nseveral vegetable crops that are rich in vitamins and minerals, e.g., vitamin\n\nA enriched carrots, spinach, pumpkin; vitamin C enriched bitter gourd,\n\nbathua, mustard, tomato; iron and calcium enriched spinach and bathua;\n\nand protein enriched beans – broad, lablab, French and garden peas.\n\n9.3 SINGLE CELL PROTEIN (SCP)\n\nConventional agricultural production of cereals, pulses, vegetables, fruits,\n\netc., may not be able to meet the demand of food at the rate at which\n\nhuman and animal population is increasing. The shift from grain to meat\n\ndiets also creates more demand for cereals as it takes 3-10 Kg of grain to\n\nproduce 1 Kg of meat by animal farming. Can you explain this statement\n\nin the light of your knowledge of food chains?  More than 25 per cent of\n\nhuman population is suffering from hunger and malnutrition. One of the\n\nalternate sources of proteins for animal and human nutrition is Single\n\nCell Protein (SCP).\n\nMicrobes are being grown on an industrial scale as source of good\n\nprotein. Blue-green algae like Spirulina can be grown easily on materials\n\nlike waste water from potato processing plants (containing starch), straw,\n\nmolasses, animal manure and even sewage, to produce large quantities\n\nand can serve as food rich in protein, minerals, fats, carbohydrate and\n\nvitamins. Incidentally such utilisation also reduces environmental\n\npollution.\n\nCertain bacterial species like Methylophilus methylotrophus, because\n\nof its high rate of biomass production and growth, can be expected to\n\nproduce 25 tonnes of protein. The fact that edible mushrooms are eaten\n\nby many people and large scale mushroom culture is a growing industry\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nSTRATEGIES FOR ENHANCEMENT IN FOOD PRODUCTION\n\n177\n\nmakes it believable that microscopic fungi  too would become\n\nacceptable as food.\n\n9.4 TISSUE CULTURE\n\nAs traditional breeding techniques failed to keep pace with demand and\n\nto provide sufficiently fast and efficient systems for crop improvement,\n\nanother technology called tissue culture got developed. What does tissue\n\nculture mean? It was learnt by scientists, during 1950s, that whole\n\nplants could be regenerated from explants, i.e., any part of a plant taken\n\nout and grown in a test tube, under sterile conditions in special nutrient\n\nmedia. This capacity to generate a whole plant from any cell/explant is\n\ncalled totipotency. You will learn how to accomplish this in higher\n\nclasses. It is important to stress here that the nutrient medium must\n\nprovide a carbon source such as sucrose and also inorganic salts,\n\nvitamins, amino acids and growth regulators like auxins, cytokinins\n\netc. By application of these methods it is possible to achieve propagation\n\nof a large number of plants in very short durations. This method of\n\nproducing thousands of plants through tissue culture is called micro-\n\npropagation. Each of these plants will be genetically identical to the\n\noriginal plant from which they were grown, i.e., they are somaclones.\n\nMany important food plants like tomato, banana, apple, etc., have been\n\nproduced on commercial scale using this method. Try to visit a tissue\n\nculture laboratory with your teacher to better understand and appreciate\n\nthe process.\n\nAnother important application of the method is the recovery of\n\nhealthy plants from diseased plants. Even if the plant is infected with a\n\nvirus, the meristem (apical and axillary) is free of virus. Hence, one\n\ncan remove the  meristem and grow it in vitro to obtain virus-free plants.\n\nScientists have succeeded in culturing meristems of banana, sugarcane,\n\npotato, etc.\n\nScientists have even isolated single cells from plants and after\n\ndigesting their cell walls have been able to isolate naked protoplasts\n\n(surrounded by plasma membranes).  Isolated protoplasts from two\n\ndifferent varieties of plants – each having a desirable character – can be\n\nfused to get hybrid protoplasts, which can be further grown to form a\n\nnew plant. These hybrids are called somatic hybrids while the process\n\nis called somatic hybridisation. Imagine a situation when a protoplast\n\nof tomato is fused with that of potato, and then they are grown – to form\n\nnew hybrid plants combining tomato and potato characteristics. Well,\n\nthis has been achieved – resulting in formation of pomato; unfortunately\n\nthis plant did not have all the desired combination of characteristics for\n\nits commercial utilisation.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n178\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1.

The ever-increasing demand\n\nof food from animals and animal products both in terms of quality and\n\nquantity has been met by good animal husbandry practices. These\n\npractices include (i) management of farm and farm animals, and (ii)\n\nanimal breeding. In view of the high nutritive value of honey and its\n\nmedicinal importance, there has been a remarkable growth in the practice\n\nof bee-keeping or apiculture. Fishery is another flourishing industry\n\nmeeting the ever-increasing demand for fish, fish products and other\n\naquatic foods.\n\nPlant breeding may be used to create varieties, which are resistant\n\nto pathogens and to insect pests. This increases the yield of the food.\n\nThis method has also been used to increase the protein content of the\n\nplant foods and thereby enhance the quality of food. In India, several\n\nvarieties of different crop plants have been produced. All these measures\n\nenhance the production of food. Techniques of tissue culture and\n\nsomatic hybridisation offer vast potential for manipulation of plants in\n\nvitro to produce new varieties.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n\n')('status', 200)
