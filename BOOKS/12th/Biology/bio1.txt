While individual\n\norganisms die without fail, species continue to live through\n\nmillions of years unless threatened by natural or anthropogenic\n\nextinction. Reproduction becomes a vital process without\n\nwhich species cannot survive for long. Each individual leaves\n\nits progeny by asexual or sexual means. Sexual mode of\n\nreproduction enables creation of new variants, so that survival\n\nadvantage is enhanced. This unit examines the general\n\nprinciples underlying reproductive processes in living organisms\n\nand then explains the details of this process in flowering plants\n\nand humans as easy to relate representative examples. A related\n\nperspective on human reproductive health and how\n\nreproductive ill health can be avoided is also presented to\n\ncomplete our understanding of biology of reproduction.\n\nChapter 1\n\nReproduction in Organisms\n\nChapter 2\n\nSexual Reproduction in\n\nflowering Plants\n\nChapter 3\n\nHuman Reproduction\n\nChapter 4\n\nReproductive Health\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPANCHANAN MAHESHWARI\n\n(1904-1966)\n\nBorn in November 1904 in Jaipur (Rajasthan) Panchanan Maheshwari\n\nrose to become one of the most distinguished botanists not only of India\n\nbut of the entire world. He moved to Allahabad for higher education\n\nwhere he obtained his D.Sc. During his college days, he was inspired\n\nby Dr W. Dudgeon, an American missionary teacher, to develop interest\n\nin Botany and especially morphology. His teacher once expressed that\n\nif his student progresses ahead of him, it will give him a great satisfaction.\n\nThese words encouraged Panchanan to enquire what he could do for\n\nhis teacher in return.\n\nHe worked on embryological aspects and popularised the use of\n\nembryological characters in taxonomy. He established the Department\n\nof Botany, University of Delhi as an important centre of research in\n\nembryology and tissue culture. He also emphasised the need for initiation\n\nof work on artificial culture of immature embryos. These days, tissue\n\nculture has become a landmark in science. His work on test tube\n\nfertilisation and intra-ovarian pollination won worldwide acclaim.\n\nHe was honoured with fellowship of Royal Society of London (FRS),\n\nIndian National Science Academy and several other institutions of\n\nexcellence. He encouraged general education and made a significant\n\ncontribution to school education by his leadership in bringing out the\n\nvery first textbooks of Biology for Higher Secondary Schools published\n\nby NCERT in 1964.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nEach and every organism can live only for a certain period\n\nof time. The period from birth to the natural death of an\n\norganism represents its life span. Life spans of a few\n\norganisms are given in Figure 1.1. Several other organisms\n\nare drawn for which you should find out their life spans\n\nand write in the spaces provided.  Examine the life spans\n\nof organisms represented in the Figure 1.1. Isn’t it both\n\ninteresting and intriguing to note that it may be as short\n\nas a few days or as long as a few thousand years?  Between\n\nthese two extremes are the life spans of most other living\n\norganisms. You may note that life spans of organisms are\n\nnot necessarily correlated with their sizes; the sizes of\n\ncrows and parrots are not very different yet their life spans\n\nshow a wide difference. Similarly, a mango tree has a much\n\nshorter life span as compared to a peepal tree. Whatever\n\nbe the life span, death of every individual organism is a\n\ncertainty, i.e., no individual is immortal, except single-celled\n\norganisms. Why do we say there is no natural death in\n\nsingle-celled organisms? Given this reality, have you ever\n\nwondered how vast number of plant and animal species\n\nhave existed on earth for several thousands of years?  There\n\nmust be some processes in living organisms that ensure\n\nthis continuity.  Yes, we are talking about reproduction,\n\nsomething that we take for granted.\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nREPRODUCTION IN ORGANISMS\n\n1.1 Asexual\n\nReproduction\n\n1.2 Sexual\n\nReproduction\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n4\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nFigure 1.1 Approximate life spans of some organisms\n\n4\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n5\n\nREPRODUCTION IN ORGANISMS\n\nReproduction is defined as a biological process in which an\n\norganism gives rise to young ones (offspring) similar to itself. The offspring\n\ngrow, mature and in turn produce new offspring. Thus, there is a cycle\n\nof birth, growth and death. Reproduction enables the continuity of the\n\nspecies, generation after generation. You will study later in Chapter 5\n\n(Principles of Inheritance and Variation) how genetic variation is created\n\nand inherited during reproduction.\n\nThere is a large diversity in the biological world and each organism\n\nhas evolved its own mechanism to multiply and produce offspring.\n\nThe organism’s habitat, its internal physiology and several other factors\n\nare collectively responsible for how it reproduces.  Based on whether\n\nthere is participation of one organism or two in the process of\n\nreproduction, it is of two types. When offspring is produced by a single\n\nparent with or without the involvement of gamete formation, the\n\nreproduction is asexual. When two parents (opposite sex) participate in\n\nthe reproductive process and also involve fusion of male and female\n\ngametes, it is called sexual reproduction.\n\n1.1  ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION\n\nIn this method, a single individual (parent) is capable of producing\n\noffspring. As a result, the offspring that are produced are not only\n\nidentical to one another but are also exact copies of their parent.\n\nAre these offspring likely to be genetically identical or different?\n\nThe term clone is used to describe such morphologically and\n\ngenetically similar individuals.\n\nFigure 1.2 Cell division in unicellular organism: (a) Budding in\nyeast; (b) Binary fission in Amoeba\n\n(b)(a)\n\nLet us see how widespread asexual reproduction is, among different\n\ngroups of organisms. Asexual reproduction is common among\n\nsingle-celled organisms, and in plants and animals with relatively simple\n\norganisations. In Protists and Monerans, the organism or the parent\n\ncell divides by mitosis into two to give rise to new individuals (Figure1.2).\n\nThus, in these organisms cell division is itself a mode of reproduction.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n6\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nMany single-celled organisms reproduce by binary fission, where a\n\ncell divides into two halves and each rapidly grows into an adult (e.g.,\n\nAmoeba, Paramecium). In yeast, the division is unequal and small\n\nbuds are produced that remain attached initially to the parent cell\n\nwhich, eventually gets separated and  mature into new yeast\n\norganisms (cells). Under unfavourable condition the Amoeba withdraws\n\nits pseudopodia and secretes a three-layered hard covering or cyst\n\naround itself. This phenomenon is termed as encystation. When\n\nfavourable conditions return, the encysted Amoeba divides by multiple\n\nfission and produces many minute amoeba or pseudopodiospores;\n\nthe cyst wall bursts out, and the spores are liberated in the surrounding\n\nmedium to grow up into many amoebae. This phenomenon is\n\nknown as sporulation.\n\nFigure1.3 Asexual reproductive structures: (a) Zoospores of Chlamydomonas; (b) Conidia of\nPenicillium; (c) Buds in Hydra ; (d) Gemmules in sponge\n\n(d)\n\n(a)\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n7\n\nREPRODUCTION IN ORGANISMS\n\nMembers of the Kingdom Fungi and simple plants such as algae\nreproduce through special asexual reproductive structures (Figure 1.3).\nThe most common of these structures are zoospores that usually are\nmicroscopic motile structures.  Other common asexual reproductive\nstructures are conidia (Penicillium), buds (Hydra) and gemmules (sponge).\n\nYou have learnt about vegetative reproduction in plants in Class XI.\n\nWhat do you think – Is vegetative reproduction also a type of asexual\n\nreproduction? Why do you say so? Is the term clone applicable to the\n\noffspring formed by vegetative reproduction?\n\nWhile in animals and other simple organisms the term asexual is used\nunambiguously, in plants, the term vegetative reproduction is frequently\nused. In plants, the units of vegetative propagation such as runner,\n\nrhizome, sucker, tuber, offset, bulb are all capable of giving rise to new\n\noffspring (Figure1.4). These structures are called vegetative propagules.\n\nFigure 1.4 Vegetative propagules in angiosperms: (a) Eyes of potato; (b) Rhizome of ginger;\n(c) Bulbil of Agave; (d) Leaf buds of Bryophyllum; (e) Offset of water hyacinth\n\nAdventitious\nBuds\n\n(a)\n\n(c) (d)\n(e)\n\n(b)\n\nBuds\n\nNodes\n\nAdventitious\nRoot\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n8\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nObviously, since the formation of these structures does not involve two\n\nparents, the process involved is asexual. In some organisms, if the body\n\nbreaks into distinct pieces (fragments) each fragment grows into an\n\nadult capable of producing offspring (e.g., Hydra). This is also a mode\n\nof asexual reproduction called fragmentation.\n\nYou must have heard about the scourge of the water bodies or about\n\nthe ‘terror of Bengal’. This is nothing but the aquatic plant ‘water hyacinth’\n\nwhich is one of the most invasive weeds found growing wherever there is\n\nstanding water. It drains oxygen from the water, which leads to death of\n\nfishes.  You will learn more about it in Chapters 13 and 14. You may find\n\nit interesting to know that this plant was introduced in India because of\n\nits beautiful flowers and shape of leaves.  Since it can propagate vegetatively\n\nat a phenomenal rate and spread all over the water body in a short period\n\nof time, it is very difficult to get rid off them.\n\nAre you aware how plants like potato, sugarcane, banana, ginger,\n\ndahlia are cultivated?  Have you seen small plants emerging from the\n\nbuds (called eyes) of the potato tuber, from the rhizomes of banana and\n\nginger? When you carefully try to determine the site of origin of the new\n\nplantlets in the plants listed above, you will notice that they invariably\n\narise from the nodes present in the modified stems of these plants. When\n\nthe nodes come in contact with damp soil or water, they produce roots\n\nand new plants. Similarly, adventitious buds arise from the notches\n\npresent at margins of leaves of Bryophyllum.  This ability is fully exploited\n\nby gardeners and farmers for commercial propagation of such plants.\n\nIt is interesting to note that asexual reproduction is the common method\n\nof reproduction in organisms that have a relatively simple organisation,\n\nlike algae and fungi and that they shift to sexual method of reproduction\n\njust before the onset of adverse conditions.  Find out how sexual\n\nreproduction enables these organisms to survive during unfavourable\n\nconditions? Why is sexual reproduction favoured under such conditions?\n\nAsexual (vegetative) as well as sexual modes of reproduction are exhibited\n\nby the higher plants. On the other hand, only sexual mode of reproduction\n\nis present in most of the animals.\n\n1.2 SEXUAL REPRODUCTION\n\nSexual reproduction involves formation of the male and female gametes,\n\neither by the same individual or by different individuals of the opposite\n\nsex. These gametes fuse to form the zygote which develops to form the\n\nnew organism. It is an elaborate, complex and slow process as compared\n\nto asexual reproduction. Because of the fusion of male and female gametes,\n\nsexual reproduction results in offspring that are not identical to the parents\n\nor amongst themselves.\n\nA study of diverse organisms–plants, animals or fungi–show that\n\nthough they differ so greatly in external morphology, internal structure\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n9\n\nREPRODUCTION IN ORGANISMS\n\nand physiology, when it comes to sexual mode of reproduction,\n\nsurprisingly, they share a similar pattern. Let us first discuss what features\n\nare common to these diverse organisms.\n\nAll organisms have to reach a certain stage of growth and maturity in\n\ntheir life, before they can reproduce sexually. That period of growth is\n\ncalled the juvenile phase. It is known as vegetative phase in plants.\n\nThis phase is of variable durations in different organisms.\n\nThe end of juvenile/vegetative phase which marks the beginning of\n\nthe reproductive phase can be seen easily in the higher plants when they\n\ncome to flower. How long does it take for marigold/rice/wheat/coconut/\n\nmango plants to come to flower?  In some plants, where flowering occurs\n\nmore than once, what would you call the inter-flowering period – juvenile\n\nor mature?\n\nObserve a few trees in your area. Do they flower during the same\n\nmonth year after year? Why do you think the availability of fruits like\n\nmango, apple, jackfruit, etc., is seasonal? Are there some plants that flower\n\nthroughout the year and some others that show seasonal flowering?\n\nPlants–the annual and biennial types, show clear cut vegetative,\n\nreproductive and senescent phases, but in the perennial species it is very\n\ndifficult to clearly define these phases. A few plants exhibit unusual\n\nflowering phenomenon; some of them such as bamboo species flower only\n\nonce in their life time, generally after 50-100 years, produce large number\n\nof fruits  and die. Another plant, Strobilanthus kunthiana (neelakuranji),\n\nflowers once in 12 years. As many of you would know, this plant flowered\n\nduring September-October 2006. Its mass flowering transformed large\n\ntracks of hilly areas in Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu into blue\n\nstretches and attracted a large number of tourists. In animals, the juvenile\n\nphase is followed by morphological and physiological changes prior to\n\nactive reproductive behaviour. The reproductive phase is also of variable\n\nduration in different organisms.\n\nCan you list the changes seen in human beings that are indicative\n\nof reproductive maturity?\n\nAmong animals, for example birds, do they lay eggs all through the\n\nyear? Or is it a seasonal phenomenon? What about other animals like\n\nfrogs and lizards? You will notice that, birds living in nature lay eggs only\n\nseasonally. However, birds in captivity (as in poultry farms) can be made\n\nto lay eggs throughout the year. In this case, laying eggs is not related to\n\nreproduction but is a commercial exploitation for human welfare.  The\n\nfemales of placental mammals exhibit cyclical changes in the activities of\n\novaries and accessory ducts as well as hormones during the reproductive\n\nphase. In non-primate mammals like cows, sheep, rats, deers, dogs, tiger,\n\netc., such cyclical changes during reproduction are called oestrus cycle\n\nwhere as in primates (monkeys, apes, and humans) it is called menstrual\n\ncycle. Many mammals, especially those living in natural, wild conditions\n\nexhibit such cycles only during favourable seasons in their reproductive\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n10\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n(a) (b) (c)\n\nFigure 1.5 Types of gametes: (a) Isogametes of Cladophora (an alga); (b) Heterogametes of\nFucus (an alga); (c) Heterogametes of Homo sapiens (Human beings)\n\nphase and are therefore called seasonal breeders. Many other mammals\n\nare reproductively active throughout their reproductive phase and hence\n\nare called continuous breeders.\n\nThat we all grow old (if we live long enough), is something that we\n\nrecognise. But what is meant by growing old? The end of reproductive\n\nphase can be considered as one of the parameters of senescence or old\n\nage. There are concomitant changes in the body (like slowing of\n\nmetabolism, etc.) during this last phase of life span. Old age ultimately\n\nleads to death.\n\nIn both plants and animals, hormones are responsible for the\n\ntransitions between the three phases. Interaction between hormones and\n\ncertain environmental factors regulate the reproductive processes and\n\nthe associated behavioural expressions of organisms.\n\nEvents in sexual reproduction : After attainment of maturity, all sexually\n\nreproducing organisms exhibit events and processes that have remarkable\n\nfundamental similarity, even though the structures associated with sexual\n\nreproduction are indeed very different. The events of sexual reproduction\n\nthough elaborate and complex, follow a regular sequence. Sexual\n\nreproduction is characterised by the fusion (or fertilisation) of the male and\n\nfemale gametes, the formation of zygote and embryogenesis. For convenience\n\nthese sequential events may be grouped into three distinct stages namely,\n\nthe pre-fertilisation, fertilisation and the post-fertilisation events.\n\n1.2.1 Pre-fertilisation Events\n\nThese include all the events of sexual reproduction prior to the fusion of\n\ngametes.  The two main pre-fertilisation events are gametogenesis and\n\ngamete transfer.\n\n1.2.1.1 Gametogenesis\n\nAs you are already aware, gametogenesis refers to the process of formation\n\nof the two types of gametes – male and female. Gametes are haploid cells.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n11\n\nREPRODUCTION IN ORGANISMS\n\nIn some algae the two gametes are so similar in appearance\n\nthat it is not possible to categorise them into male and female gametes.\n\nThey are hence called homogametes (isogametes) (Figure 1.5a).\n\nHowever, in a majority of sexually reproducing organisms the gametes\n\nproduced are of two morphologically distinct types (heterogametes).  In\n\nsuch organisms the male gamete is called the antherozoid or sperm\n\nand the female gamete is called the egg or ovum (Figure1.5 b, c).\n\nSexuality in organisms: Sexual reproduction in organisms generally\n\ninvolves the fusion of gametes from two different individuals. But this\n\nis not always true.  From your recollection of examples studied in\n\nClass XI, can you identify cases where self-fertilisation is observed? Of\n\ncourse, citing such examples in plants is easy.\n\nPlants may have both male and female reproductive structures in the\n\nsame plant (bisexual) (Figure 1.6 c, e) or on different plants  (unisexual)\n\n(Figure 1.6d). In several fungi and plants, terms such as homothallic\n\nand monoecious are used to denote the bisexual condition and\n\nheterothallic and dioecious are the terms used to describe unisexual\n\ncondition. In flowering plants, the unisexual male flower is staminate,\n\ni.e., bearing stamens, while the female is pistillate or bearing pistils. In\n\nsome flowering plants, both male and female flowers  may be present on\n\nthe same individual (monoecious) or on separate individuals (dioecious).\n\nSome examples of monoecious plants are  cucurbits and coconuts and of\n\ndioecious plants are papaya and date palm. Name the type of gametes\n\nthat are formed in staminate and pistillate flowers.\n\nBut what about animals?  Are individuals of all species either male or\n\nfemale (unisexual)? Or are there species which possess both the\n\nreproductive organs (bisexual)? You probably can make a list\n\nof several unisexual animal species. Earthworms, (Figure 1.6a) sponge,\n\ntapeworm and leech, typical examples of bisexual animals that possess\n\nboth male and female reproductive organs, are hermaphrodites.\n\nCockroach (Figure 1.6b) is an example of a unisexual species.\n\nCell division during gamete formation : Gametes in all heterogametic\n\nspecies are of two types namely, male and female. Gametes are haploid\n\nthough the parent plant body from which they arise may be either haploid\n\nor diploid. A haploid parent produces gametes by mitotic division.  Does\n\nthis mean that meiosis never occurs in organisms that are haploid?\n\nCarefully examine the flow charts of life cycles of algae that you have\n\nstudied in Class XI (Chapter 3) to get a suitable answer.\n\nSeveral organisms belonging to monera, fungi, algae and bryophytes\n\nhave haploid plant body, but in organisms belonging to pteridophytes,\n\ngymnosperms, angiosperms and most of the animals including human\n\nbeings, the parental body is diploid.  It is obvious that meiosis, the reduction\n\ndivision, has to occur if a diploid body has to produce haploid gametes.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n12\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nFigure 1.6 Diversity of sexuality in organisms (a) Bisexual animal (Earthworm); (b) Unisexual\nanimal (Cockroach); (c) Monoecious plant (Chara); (d) Dioecious plant (Marchantia);\n(e) Bisexual flower (sweet potato)\n\n(b)\n\nMale\n\nFemale\n\nTestis sac\nwith testis\n\nOvary\n\nClitellum\n\n(a)\n\nTestis\n\nOvary\n\nFemale thallus\n\nAntheridiophore\n\nMale thallus\n\nArchegoniophore\n\n(c)\n\n(d) (e)\n\n\n\n13\n\nREPRODUCTION IN ORGANISMS\n\nTable 1.1: Chromosome Numbers in Meiocytes (diploid, 2n) and Gametes\n\n(haploid, n) of Some Organisms.

At the end of meiosis, only one set of chromosomes\n\ngets incorporated into each gamete.  Carefully study Table 1.1 and fill in\n\nthe diploid and haploid chromosome numbers of organisms.  Is there any\n\nrelationship in the number of chromosomes of meiocytes and gametes?\n\n1.2.1.2 Gamete Transfer\n\nAfter their formation, male and female gametes must be physically\n\nbrought together to facilitate fusion (fertilisation). Have you ever\n\nwondered how the gametes meet? In a majority of organisms, male\n\ngamete is motile and the female gamete is stationary. Exceptions are a\n\nfew fungi and algae in which both types of gametes are motile\n\n(Figure1.7a). There is a need for a medium through which the male\n\ngametes move. In several simple plants like algae, bryophytes and\n\npteridophytes, water is the medium through which this gamete transfer\n\ntakes place. A large number of the male gametes, however, fail to reach\n\nthe female gametes. To compensate this loss of male gametes during\n\ntransport, the number of male gametes produced is several thousand\n\ntimes the number of female gametes produced.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n14\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nIn seed plants, pollen grains are the carriers of male\n\ngametes and  ovule have the egg. Pollen grains\n\nproduced in anthers therefore, have to be transferred\n\nto the stigma before it can lead to fertilisation (Figure\n\n1.7b). In bisexual, self-fertilising plants, e.g., peas,\n\ntransfer of pollen grains to the stigma is relatively easy\n\nas anthers and stigma are located close to each other;\n\npollen grains soon after they are shed, come in contact\n\nwith the stigma. But in cross pollinating plants\n\n(including dioecious plants), a specialised event called\n\npollination facilitates transfer of pollen grains to the\n\nstigma. Pollen grains germinate on the stigma and the\n\npollen tubes carrying the male gametes reach the ovule\n\nand discharge male gametes near the egg.  In dioecious\n\nanimals, since male and female gametes are formed in\n\ndifferent individuals, the organism must evolve a\n\nspecial mechanism for gamete transfer.  Successful\n\ntransfer and coming together of gametes is essential\n\nfor the most critical event in sexual reproduction, the\n\nfertilisation.\n\n1.2.2 Fertilisation\n\nThe most vital event of sexual reproduction is perhaps\n\nthe fusion of gametes. This process called syngamy\n\nresults in the formation of a diploid zygote. The term\n\nfertilisation is also often used for this process. The\n\nterms syngamy and fertilisation are frequently used\n\nthough , interchangeably.\n\nWhat would happen if syngamy does not occur?\n\nHowever, it has to be mentioned here that in some\n\norganisms like rotifers, honeybees and even some lizards\n\nand birds (turkey), the female gamete undergoes\n\ndevelopment to form new organisms without fertilisation. This\n\nphenomenon is called parthenogenesis.\n\nWhere does syngamy occur?  In most aquatic organisms, such  as a\n\nmajority of algae and fishes as well as amphibians, syngamy occurs in\n\nthe external medium (water), i.e., outside the body of the organism.  This\n\ntype of gametic fusion is called external fertilisation. Organisms\n\nexhibiting external fertilisation show great synchrony between the sexes\n\nand release a large number of gametes into the surrounding medium\n\n(water) in order to enhance the chances of syngamy.  This happens in the\n\nbony fishes and frogs where a large number of offspring are produced. A\n\nmajor disadvantage is that the offspring are extremely vulnerable to\n\npredators threatening their survival up to adulthood.\n\nFigure 1.7 (a) Homogametic contact in\nalga; (b) Germinating pollen\ngrains on the stigma of  a flower\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n15\n\nREPRODUCTION IN ORGANISMS\n\nIn many terrestrial organisms, belonging to fungi, higher animals such\n\nas reptiles, birds, mammals and in a majority of plants (bryophytes,\n\npteridophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms), syngamy occurs inside\n\nthe body of the organism, hence the process is called internal fertilisation.\n\nIn all these organisms, egg is formed inside the female body where they\n\nfuse with the male gamete. In organisms exhibiting internal fertilisation,\n\nthe male gamete is motile and has to reach the egg in order to fuse with it.\n\nIn these even though the number of sperms produced is very large, there\n\nis a significant reduction in the number of eggs produced. In seed plants,\n\nhowever, the non-motile male gametes are carried to female gamete by\n\npollen tubes.\n\n1.2.3 Post-fertilisation Events\n\nEvents in sexual reproduction after the formation of zygote are called\n\npost-fertilisation events.\n\n1.2.3.1 The Zygote\n\nFormation of the diploid zygote is universal in all sexually reproducing\n\norganisms. In organisms with external fertilisation, zygote is formed in\n\nthe external medium (usually water), whereas in those exhibiting internal\n\nfertilisation, zygote is formed inside the body of the organism.\n\n Further development of the zygote depends on the type of life cycle\n\nthe organism has and the environment it is exposed to. In organisms\n\nbelonging to fungi and algae, zygote develops a thick wall that is resistant\n\nto dessication and damage. It undergoes a period of rest before\n\ngermination.  In organisms with haplontic life cycle (As you have read\n\nin  Class XI), zygote divides by meiosis to form haploid spores that grow\n\ninto haploid individuals. Consult your Class XI book and find out what\n\nkind of development takes place in the zygote in organisms with diplontic\n\nand haplo-diplontic life cycles.\n\nZygote is the vital link that ensures continuity of species\n\nbetween organisms of one generation and the next. Every sexually\n\nreproducing organism, including human beings begin life as a single\n\ncell–the zygote.\n\n1.2.3.2 Embryogenesis\n\nEmbryogenesis refers to the process of development of embryo from the\n\nzygote.  During embryogenesis, zygote undergoes cell division (mitosis)\n\nand cell differentiation. While cell divisions increase the number of cells\n\nin the developing embryo; cell differentiation helps groups of cells to\n\nundergo certain modifications to form specialised tissues and organs to\n\nform an organism. You have studied about the process of cell division\n\nand differentiation in the previous class.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n16\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nAnimals are categorised into oviparous and viviparous based on\n\nwhether the development of the zygote takes place outside the body of\n\nthe female parent or inside, i.e., whether they lay fertilised/unfertilised\n\neggs or give birth to young ones.  In oviparous animals like reptiles and\n\nbirds, the fertilised eggs covered by hard calcareous shell are laid in a\n\nsafe place in the environment; after a period of incubation young ones\n\nhatch out. On the other hand, in viviparous animals (majority of mammals\n\nincluding human beings), the zygote develops into a young one inside\n\nthe body of the female organism. After attaining a certain stage of growth,\n\nthe young ones are delivered out of the body of the female organism.\n\nBecause of proper embryonic care and protection, the chances of survival\n\nof young ones is greater in viviparous organisms.\n\nIn flowering plants, the zygote is formed inside the ovule. After\n\nfertilisation the sepals, petals and stamens of the flower wither and fall\n\noff. Can you name a plant in which the sepals remain attached? The\n\npistil however, remains attached to the plant.  The zygote develops  into\n\nthe embryo and the ovules develop into the seed. The ovary develops into\n\nthe fruit which develops a thick wall called pericarp that is protective in\n\nfunction (Figure 1.8). After dispersal, seeds germinate under favourable\n\nconditions to produce new plants.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nReproduction enables a species to live generation after generation.\nReproduction in organisms can be broadly classified into asexual and\nsexual reproduction. Asexual reproduction does not involve the fusion\nof gametes. It is common in organisms that have a relatively simple\norganisation such as the fungi, algae and some invertebrate animals.\nThe offspring formed by asexual reproduction are identical and can be\nreferred to as clones. Zoospores, conidia, etc., are the most common\nasexual structures formed in several algae and fungi. Budding\nand gemmule formation are the common asexual methods seen in\nlower animals.\n\nProkaryotes and unicellular organisms reproduce asexually by\ncell division or binary fission of the parent cell. In several aquatic and\n\nFigure 1.8 A few kinds of fruit showing seeds (S) and\nprotective pericarp (P)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n17\n\nREPRODUCTION IN ORGANISMS\n\nterrestrial species of angiosperms, structures such as runners,\nrhizomes, suckers, tubers, offsets, etc., are capable of giving rise to\nnew offspring.  This method of asexual reproduction is generally\nreferred to as vegetative propagation.\n\nSexual reproduction involves the formation and fusion of gametes.\nIt is a complex and slower process as compared to asexual reproduction.\nMost of the higher animals reproduce almost entirely by sexual method.\nEvents of sexual reproduction may be categorised into pre-fertilisation,\nfertilisation and post-fertilisation events.  Pre-fertilisation events include\ngametogenesis and gamete transfer while post-fertilisation events\ninclude the formation of zygote and embryogenesis.\n\nOrganisms may be bisexual or unisexual.  Sexuality in plants is\nvaried, particularly in angiosperms, due to the production of diverse\ntypes of flowers.  Plants are defined as monoecious and dioecious.\nFlowers may be bisexual or unisexual flowers.\n\nGametes are haploid in nature and usually a direct product of meiotic\ndivision except in haploid organisms where gametes are formed by mitosis.\n\nTransfer of male gametes is an essential event in sexual reproduction.\nIt is relatively easy in bisexual organisms. In unisexual animals it occurs\nby copulation or simultaneous release. In angiosperms, a special process\ncalled pollination ensures transfer of pollen grains which carry the pollen\ngrains to the stigma.\n\nSyngamy (fertilisation) occurs between the male and female gametes.\nSyngamy may occur either externally, outside the body of organisms or\ninternally, inside the body. Syngamy leads to formation of a specialised\ncell called zygote.\n\n The process of development of embryo from the zygote is called\nembryogenesis.  In animals, the zygote starts developing soon after its\nformation. Animals may be either oviparous or viviparous.  Embryonal\nprotection and care are better in viviparous organisms.\n\n In flowering plants, after fertilisation, ovary develops into fruit and\novules mature into seeds. Inside the mature seed is the progenitor of\n\nthe next generation, the embryo.\n\nEXERCISES\n1. Why is reproduction essential for organisms?\n\n2.
