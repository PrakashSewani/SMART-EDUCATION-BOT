Many ecologists regard the entire\n\nbiosphere as a global ecosystem, as a composite of all\n\nlocal ecosystems on Earth. Since this system is too much\n\nbig and complex to be studied at one time, it is convenient\n\nto divide it into two basic categories, namely the\n\nterrestrial and the aquatic. Forest, grassland and desert\n\nare some examples of terrestrial ecosystems; pond, lake,\n\nwetland, river and estuary are some examples of aquatic\n\necosystems. Crop fields and an aquarium may also be\n\nconsidered as man-made ecosystems.\n\nWe will first look at the structure of the ecosystem, in\n\norder to appreciate the input (productivity), transfer of\n\nenergy (food chain/web, nutrient cycling) and the output\n\n(degradation and energy loss). We will also look at the\n\nrelationships – cycles, chains, webs – that are created as\n\na result of these energy flows within the system and their\n\ninter- relationship.\n\nCHAPTER 14\n\nECOSYSTEM\n\n14.1 Ecosystem–Structure\n\nand Function\n\n14.2. Productivity\n\n14.3 Decomposition\n\n14.4 Energy Flow\n\n14.5 Ecological Pyramids\n\n14.6 Ecological Succession\n\n14.7 Nutrient Cycling\n\n14.8 Ecosystem Services\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n242\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n14.1 ECOSYSTEM – STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION\n\nIn chapter 13, you have looked at the various components of the\n\nenvironment- abiotic and biotic. You studied how the individual biotic\n\nand abiotic factors affected each other and their surrounding. Let us look\n\nat these components in a more integrated manner and see how the flow of\n\nenergy takes place within these components of the ecosystem.\n\nInteraction of biotic and abiotic components result in a physical\n\nstructure that is characteristic for each type of ecosystem. Identification\n\nand enumeration of plant and animal species of an ecosystem gives its\n\nspecies composition. Vertical distribution of different species occupying\n\ndifferent levels is called stratification. For example, trees occupy top\n\nvertical strata or layer of a forest, shrubs the second and herbs and grasses\n\noccupy the bottom layers.\n\nThe components of the ecosystem are seen to function as a unit when\n\nyou consider the following aspects:\n\n(i) Productivity;\n\n(ii) Decomposition;\n\n(iii) Energy flow; and\n\n(iv) Nutrient cycling.\n\nTo understand the ethos of an aquatic ecosystem let us take a small\n\npond as an example. This is fairly a self-sustainable unit and rather simple\n\nexample that explain even the complex interactions that exist in an aquatic\n\necosystem. A pond is a shallow water body in which all the above\n\nmentioned four basic components of an ecosystem are well exhibited.\n\nThe abiotic component is the water with all the dissolved inorganic and\n\norganic substances and the rich soil deposit at the bottom of the pond.\n\nThe solar input, the cycle of temperature, day-length and other climatic\n\nconditions regulate the rate of function of the entire pond. The autotrophic\n\ncomponents include the phytoplankton, some algae and the floating,\n\nsubmerged and marginal plants found at the edges. The consumers are\n\nrepresented by the zooplankton, the free swimming and bottom dwelling\n\nforms. The decomposers are the fungi, bacteria and flagellates especially\n\nabundant in the bottom of the pond. This system performs all the functions\n\nof any ecosystem and of the biosphere as a whole, i.e., conversion of\n\ninorganic into organic material with the help of the radiant energy of the\n\nsun by the autotrophs; consumption of the autotrophs by heterotrophs;\n\ndecomposition and mineralisation of the dead matter to release them back\n\nfor reuse by the autotrophs, these event are repeated over and over again.\n\nThere is unidirectional movement of energy towards the higher trophic\n\nlevels and its dissipation and loss as heat to the environment.\n\n14.2. PRODUCTIVITY\n\nA constant input of solar energy is the basic requirement for any ecosystem\n\nto function and sustain. Primary production is defined as the amount of\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n243\n\nECOSYSTEM\n\nbiomass or organic matter produced per unit area over a time period by\n\nplants during photosynthesis. It is expressed in terms of weight (gm–2) or\n\nenergy (kcal m–2). The rate of biomass production is called productivity.\n\nIt is expressed in terms of gm–2 yr –1 or (kcal m–2) yr–1 to compare the\n\nproductivity of different ecosystems. It can be divided into gross primary\n\nproductivity (GPP) and net primary productivity (NPP). Gross primary\n\nproductivity of an ecosystem is the rate of production of organic matter\n\nduring photosynthesis. A considerable amount of GPP is utilised by plants\n\nin respiration. Gross primary productivity minus respiration losses (R),\n\nis the net primary productivity (NPP).\n\nGPP – R = NPP\n\nNet primary productivity is the available biomass for the consumption\n\nto heterotrophs (herbiviores and decomposers). Secondary productivity\n\nis defined as the rate of formation of new organic matter by\n\nconsumers.\n\nPrimary productivity depends on the plant species inhabiting a\n\nparticular area. It also depends on a variety of environmental factors,\n\navailability of nutrients and photosynthetic capacity of plants. Therefore,\n\nit varies in different types of ecosystems. The annual net primary\n\nproductivity of the whole biosphere is approximately 170 billion tons\n\n(dry weight) of organic matter. Of this, despite occupying about 70 per\n\ncent of the surface, the productivity of the oceans are only 55 billion tons.\n\nRest of course, is on land. Discuss the main reason for the low\n\nproductivity of ocean with your teacher.\n\n14.3 DECOMPOSITION\n\nYou may have heard of the earthworm being referred to as the farmer’s\n\n‘friend’. This is so because they help in the breakdown of complex organic\n\nmatter as well as in loosening of the soil. Similarly,  decomposers break\n\ndown complex organic matter into inorganic substances like carbon\n\ndioxide, water and nutrients and the process is called decomposition.\n\nDead plant remains such as leaves, bark, flowers and dead remains of\n\nanimals, including fecal matter, constitute detritus, which is the raw\n\nmaterial for decomposition. The important steps in the process of\n\ndecomposition are fragmentation, leaching, catabolism, humification and\n\nmineralisation.\n\nDetritivores (e.g., earthworm) break down detritus into smaller particles.\n\nThis process is called fragmentation. By the process of leaching, water-\n\nsoluble inorganic nutrients go down into the soil horizon and get precipitated\n\nas unavailable salts. Bacterial and fungal enzymes degrade detritus into\n\nsimpler inorganic substances. This process is called as catabolism.\n\nIt is important to note that all the above steps in decomposition  operate\n\nsimultaneously on the detritus (Figure 14.1). Humification and\n\nmineralisation occur during decomposition in the soil. Humification leads\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n244\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nto accumulation of a dark coloured amorphous substance called humus\n\nthat is highly resistant to microbial action and undergoes decomposition\n\nat an extremely slow rate. Being colloidal in nature it serves as a reservoir\n\nof nutrients. The humus is further degraded by some microbes and release\n\nof inorganic nutrients occur by the process  known as mineralisation.\n\nDecomposition is largely an oxygen-requiring process. The rate of\n\ndecomposition is controlled by chemical composition of detritus and\n\nclimatic factors. In a particular climatic condition, decomposition rate\n\nis slower if detritus is rich in lignin and chitin, and quicker, if detritus is\n\nrich in nitrogen and water-soluble substances like sugars. Temperature\n\nand soil moisture are the most important climatic factors that regulate\n\ndecomposition through their effects on the activities of soil microbes.\n\nWarm and moist environment favour decomposition whereas low\n\ntemperature and anaerobiosis inhibit decomposition resulting in build\n\nup of organic materials.\n\nFigure 14.1 Diagrammatic representation of decomposition cycle in a terrestrial ecosystem\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n245\n\nECOSYSTEM\n\n14.4 ENERGY FLOW\n\nExcept for the deep sea hydro-thermal ecosystem, sun is the only source\n\nof energy for all ecosystems on Earth.  Of the incident solar radiation less\n\nthan 50 per cent of it is photosynthetically active radiation (PAR).  We\n\nknow that plants and photosynthetic bacteria (autotrophs), fix Sun’s\n\nradiant energy to make food from simple inorganic materials. Plants\n\ncapture only 2-10  per cent of the PAR and this small amount of energy\n\nsustains the entire living world.  So, it is very important to know how the\n\nsolar energy captured by plants flows through different organisms of an\n\necosystem. All organisms are dependent for their food on producers, either\n\ndirectly or indirectly. So you find unidirectional flow of energy from the\n\nsun to producers and then to consumers. Is this in keeping with the first\n\nlaw of thermodynamics?\n\nFurther, ecosystems are not exempt from the Second Law of\n\nthermodynamics. They need a constant supply of energy to synthesise\n\nthe molecules they require, to counteract the universal tendency toward\n\nincreasing disorderliness.\n\nThe green plant in the ecosystem are called producers. In a terrestrial\n\necosystem, major producers are herbaceous and woody plants. Likewise,\n\nproducers in an aquatic ecosystem are various species like phytoplankton,\n\nalgae and higher plants.\n\nYou have read about the food chains and webs that exist in nature.\n\nStarting from the plants (or producers) food chains or rather webs are\n\nformed such that an animal feeds on a plant or on another animal and in\n\nturn is food for another. The chain or web is formed because of this\n\ninterdependency. No energy that is trapped into an organism remains in\n\nit for ever. The energy trapped by the producer, hence, is either passed on\n\nto a consumer or the organism dies. Death of organism is the beginning\n\nof the detritus food chain/web.\n\nAll animals depend on plants (directly or indirectly) for their food needs.\n\nThey are hence called consumers and also heterotrophs.  If they feed on\n\nthe producers, the plants, they are called primary consumers, and if the\n\nanimals eat other animals which in turn eat the plants (or their produce)\n\nthey are called secondary consumers. Likewise, you could have tertiary\n\nconsumers too.  Obviously the primary consumers will be herbivores.\n\nSome common herbivores are insects, birds and mammals in terrestrial\n\necosystem and molluscs in aquatic ecosystem.\n\nThe consumers that feed on these herbivores are carnivores, or more\n\ncorrectly primary carnivores (though secondary consumers). Those\n\nanimals that depend on the primary carnivores for food are labelled\n\nsecondary carnivores. A simple grazing food chain (GFC) is depicted\n\nbelow:\n\n Grass                            Goat                               Man\n\n   (Producer)                 (Primary Consumer) (Secondary consumer)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n246\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nThe detritus food chain (DFC) begins with dead organic matter. It is\n\nmade up of decomposers which are heterotrophic organisms, mainly\n\nfungi and bacteria. They meet their energy and nutrient requirements by\n\ndegrading dead organic matter or detritus. These are also known as\n\nsaprotrophs (sapro: to decompose). Decomposers secrete digestive\n\nenzymes that breakdown dead and waste materials into simple, inorganic\n\nmaterials, which are subsequently absorbed by them.\n\nIn an aquatic ecosystem, GFC is the major conduit for energy flow.\n\nAs against this, in a terrestrial ecosystem, a much larger fraction of energy\n\nflows through the detritus food chain than through the GFC. Detritus\n\nfood chain may be connected with the grazing food chain at some levels:\n\nsome of the organisms of DFC are prey to the GFC animals, and in a natural\n\necosystem, some animals like cockroaches, crows, etc., are omnivores.\n\nThese natural interconnection of food chains make it a  food web. How\n\nwould you classify human beings!\n\nOrganisms occupy a place in the natural surroundings or in a\n\ncommunity according to their feeding relationship with other organisms.\n\nBased on the source of their nutrition or food, organisms occupy a specific\n\nplace in the food chain that is known as their trophic level. Producers\n\nbelong to the first trophic level, herbivores (primary consumer) to the\n\nsecond and carnivores (secondary consumer) to the third (Figure 14.2).\n\nFigure 14.2 Diagrammatic representation of trophic levels in an ecosystem\n\n246\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n247\n\nECOSYSTEM\n\nFigure 14.3 Energy flow through different trophic levels\n\n247\n\nThe important point to note is that the amount of energy decreases at\n\nsuccessive trophic levels.  When any organism dies it is converted to\n\ndetritus or dead biomass that serves as an energy source for decomposers.\n\nOrganisms at each trophic level depend on those at the lower trophic level\n\nfor their energy demands.\n\nEach trophic level has a certain mass of living material at a particular\n\ntime called as the standing crop. The standing crop is measured as the\n\nmass of living organisms (biomass) or the number in a unit area. The\n\nbiomass of a species is expressed in terms of fresh or dry weight.\n\nMeasurement of biomass in terms of dry weight is more accurate. Why?\n\nThe number of trophic levels in the grazing food chain is restricted as\n\nthe transfer of energy follows 10 per cent law – only 10 per cent of the\n\nenergy is transferred to each trophic level from the lower trophic level.  In\n\nnature, it is possible to have so many levels – producer, herbivore, primary\n\ncarnivore, secondary carnivore in the grazing food chain (Figure 14.3) .\n\nDo you think there is any such limitation in a detritus food chain?\n\n14.5 ECOLOGICAL PYRAMIDS\n\nYou must be familiar with the shape of a pyramid. The base of a pyramid\n\nis broad and it narrows towards the apex. One gets a similar shape,\n\nwhether you express the food or energy relationship between organisms\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n248\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nat different trophic levels. This, relationship is expressed in terms of\n\nnumber, biomass or energy. The base of each pyramid represents the\n\nproducers or the first trophic level while the apex represents tertiary or\n\ntop level consumer. The three types of ecological pyramids that are usually\n\nstudied are (a) pyramid of number; (b) pyramid of biomass and (c) pyramid\n\nof energy. For detail (see Figure 14.4 a, b, c and d).\n\nFigure 14.4 (a) Pyramid of numbers in a grassland ecosystem. Only three top-carnivores are\nsupported in an ecosystem based on production of nearly 6 millions plants\n\nFigure 14.4 (b) Pyramid of biomass shows a sharp decrease in biomass at higher trophic levels\n\nFigure 14.4 (c) Inverted pyramid of biomass-small standing crop of phytoplankton supports large\nstanding crop of zooplankton\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n249\n\nECOSYSTEM\n\nFigure 14.4 (d) An ideal pyramid of energy. Observe that primary producers convert only 1% of\n  the energy in the sunlight available to them into NPP\n\nAny calculations of energy content, biomass or numbers, has to include\n\nall organisms at that trophic level.  No generalisations we make will be\n\ntrue if we take only a few individuals at any trophic level into account.\n\nAlso a given organism may occupy more than one trophic level\n\nsimultaneously. One must remember that the trophic level represents a\n\nfunctional level, not a species as such. A given species may occupy more\n\nthan one trophic level in the same ecosystem at the same time; for example,\n\na sparrow is a primary consumer when it eats seeds, fruits, peas, and a\n\nsecondary consumer when it eats insects and worms. Can you work out\n\nhow many trophic levels human beings function at in a food chain?\n\nIn most ecosystems, all the pyramids, of number, of energy and\n\nbiomass are upright, i.e., producers are more in number and biomass\n\nthan the herbivores, and herbivores are more in number and biomass\n\nthan the carnivores.  Also energy at a lower trophic level is always more\n\nthan at a higher level.\n\nThere are exceptions to this generalisation: If you were to count the\n\nnumber of insects feeding on a big tree what kind of pyramid would you\n\nget?  Now add an estimate of the number of small birds depending on the\n\ninsects, as also the number of larger birds eating the smaller. Draw the\n\nshape you would get.\n\nThe pyramid of biomass in sea is generally inverted because the\n\nbiomass of fishes far exceeds that of phytoplankton. Isn’t that a paradox?\n\nHow would you explain this?\n\nPyramid of energy is always upright, can never be inverted,  because\n\nwhen energy flows from a particular trophic level to the next trophic level,\n\nsome energy is always lost as heat at each step. Each bar in the energy\n\npyramid indicates the amount of energy present at each trophic level in a\n\ngiven time or annually per unit area.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n250\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nHowever, there are certain limitations of ecological pyramids such as\n\nit does not take into account the same species belonging to two or more\n\ntrophic levels. It assumes a simple food chain, something that almost\n\nnever exists in nature; it does not accommodate a food web. Moreover,\n\nsaprophytes are not given any place in ecological pyramids even though\n\nthey play a vital role in the ecosystem.\n\n14.6 ECOLOGICAL SUCCESSION\n\nYou have learnt in Chapter 13, the characteristics of population and\n\ncommunity and also their response to environment and how such\n\nresponses vary from an individual response. Let us examine another aspect\n\nof community response to environment over time.\n\nAn important characteristic of all communities is that their\n\ncomposition and structure constantly change in response to the changing\n\nenvironmental conditions. This change is orderly and sequential, parallel\n\nwith the changes in the physical environment. These changes lead finally\n\nto a community that is in near equilibrium with the environment and\n\nthat is called a climax community. The gradual and fairly predictable\n\nchange in the species composition of a given area is called ecological\n\nsuccession. During succession some species colonise an area and  their\n\npopulation become more numerous whereas populations of other species\n\ndecline and even disappear.\n\nThe entire sequence of communities that successively change in a\n\ngiven area are called sere(s). The individual transitional communities are\n\ntermed seral stages or seral communities. In the successive seral stages\n\nthere is a change in the diversity of species of organisms, increase in the\n\nnumber of species and organisms as well as an increase in the total biomass.\n\nThe present day communities in the world have come to be because\n\nof succession that has occurred over millions of years since life started on\n\nearth. Actually succession and evolution would have been parallel\n\nprocesses at that time.\n\nSuccession is hence a process that starts in an area where no living\n\norganisms are there – these could be areas where no living organisms\n\never existed, say bare rock; or in areas that somehow, lost all the living\n\norganisms that existed there.  The former is called primary succession,\n\nwhile the latter is termed secondary succession.\n\nExamples of areas where primary succession occurs are newly cooled\n\nlava, bare rock, newly created pond or reservoir. The establishment of a\n\nnew biotic community is generally slow. Before a biotic community of\n\ndiverse organisms can become established, there must be soil. Depending\n\nmostly on the climate, it takes natural processes several hundred to several\n\nthousand years to produce fertile soil on bare rock.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n251\n\nECOSYSTEM\n\nSecondary succession begins in areas where natural biotic\n\ncommunities have been destroyed such as in abandoned farm lands,\n\nburned or cut forests, lands that have been flooded. Since some soil or\n\nsediment is present, succession is faster than primary succession.\n\nDescription of ecological succession usually focuses on changes in\n\nvegetation. However, these vegetational changes in turn affect food and\n\nshelter for various types of animals. Thus, as succession proceeds, the\n\nnumbers and types of animals and decomposers also change.\n\nAt any time during primary or secondary succession, natural or\n\nhuman induced disturbances (fire, deforestation, etc.), can convert a\n\nparticular seral stage of succession to an earlier stage. Also such\n\ndisturbances create new conditions that encourage some species and\n\ndiscourage or eliminate other species.\n\n14.6.1 Succession of Plants\n\nBased on the nature of the habitat – whether it is water (or very wet areas)\n\nor it is on very dry areas – succession of plants is called hydrarch or\n\nxerarch, respectively. Hydrarch succession takes place in wet areas and\n\nthe successional series progress from hydric to the mesic conditions. As\n\nagainst this, xerarch succession takes place in dry areas and the series\n\nprogress from xeric to mesic conditions. Hence, both hydrarch and xerarch\n\nsuccessions lead to medium water conditions (mesic) – neither too dry\n\n(xeric) nor too wet (hydric).\n\nThe species that invade a bare area are called pioneer species. In\n\nprimary succession on rocks these are usually lichens which are able to\n\nsecrete acids to dissolve rock, helping in weathering and soil formation.\n\nThese later pave way to some very small plants like bryophytes, which\n\nare able to take hold in the small amount of soil. They are, with time,\n\nsucceeded by higher plants, and after several more stages, ultimately a\n\nstable climax forest community is formed. The climax community remains\n\nstable as long as the environment remains unchanged. With time the\n\nxerophytic habitat gets converted into a mesophytic one.\n\nIn primary succession in water, the pioneers are the small\n\nphytoplanktons, which are replaced with time by rooted-submerged plants,\n\nrooted-floating angiosperms followed by free-floating plants, then reed-\n\nswamp, marsh-meadow, scrub  and finally the trees.  The climax again would\n\nbe a forest. With time the water body is converted into land (Figure 14.5).\n\nIn secondary succession the species that invade depend on the\n\ncondition of the soil, availability of water, the environment as also the\n\nseeds or other propagules present. Since soil is already there, the rate of\n\nsuccession is much faster and hence,  climax is also reached more quickly.\n\nWhat is important to understand is that succession, particularly\n\nprimary succession, is a very slow process, taking maybe thousands of\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n252\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nyears for the climax to be reached. Another important fact is to understand\n\nthat all succession whether taking place in water or on land, proceeds to\n\na similar climax community – the mesic.\n\nFigure 14.5 Diagrammatic representation of primary succession\n\n(a) (d)\n\n(b) (e)\n\n(c)\n(f)\n\n(g)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n253\n\nECOSYSTEM\n\n14.7 NUTRIENT CYCLING\n\nYou have studied in Class XI that organisms need a constant supply of\n\nnutrients to grow, reproduce and regulate various body functions. The\n\namount of nutrients, such as carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, etc.,\n\npresent in the soil at any given time, is referred to as the standing state. It\n\nvaries in different kinds of ecosystems and also on a seasonal basis.\n\nWhat is important is to appreciate that nutrients which are never lost\n\nfrom the ecosystems, rather they are recycled time and again indefinitely.\n\nThe movement of nutrient elements through the various components of\n\nan ecosystem is called nutrient cycling. Another name of nutrient cycling\n\nis biogeochemical cycles (bio: living organism, geo: rocks, air, water).\n\nNutrient cycles are of two types: (a) gaseous and (b) sedimentary. The\n\nFigure 14.6 Simplified model of carbon cycle in the biosphere\n\nreservoir for gaseous type of nutrient cycle (e.g., nitrogen, carbon cycle)\n\nexists in the atmosphere and for the sedimentary cycle (e.g., sulphur and\n\nphosphorus cycle), the reservoir is located in Earth’s crust. Environmental\n\nfactors, e.g., soil, moisture, pH, temperature, etc., regulate the rate of\n\nrelease of nutrients into the atmosphere. The function of the reservoir is\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n254\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nto meet with the deficit which occurs due to imbalance in the rate of influx\n\nand efflux.\n\nYou have made a detailed study of nitrogen cycle in class XI. Here we\n\ndiscuss carbon and phosphorus cycles.\n\n14.7.1 Ecosystem – Carbon Cycle\n\nWhen you study the composition of living organisms, carbon constitutes\n\n49 per cent of dry weight of organisms and is next only to water. If we\n\nlook at the total quantity of global carbon, we find that 71 per cent carbon\n\nis found dissolved in oceans. This oceanic reservoir regulates the amount\n\nof carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (Figure 14.6). Do you know that the\n\natmosphere only contains about 1per cent of total global carbon?\n\nFossil fuel also represent a reservoir of carbon. Carbon cycling occurs\n\nthrough atmosphere, ocean and through living and dead organisms.\n\nAccording to one estimate 4 × 1013 kg of carbon is fixed annually in the\n\nbiosphere through photosynthesis. A considerable amount of carbon\n\nreturns to the atmosphere as CO\n2\n through respiratory activities of the\n\nproducers and consumers. Decomposers also contribute substantially\n\nto CO\n2\n pool by their processing of waste materials and dead organic matter\n\nof land or oceans. Some amount of the fixed carbon is lost to sediments\n\nand removed from circulation. Burning of wood, forest fire and combustion\n\nof organic matter, fossil fuel, volcanic activity are additional sources for\n\nreleasing CO\n2\n in the atmosphere.\n\nHuman activities have significantly influenced the carbon cycle. Rapid\n\ndeforestation and massive burning of fossil fuel for energy and transport\n\nhave significantly increased the rate of release of carbon dioxide into the\n\natmosphere (see greenhouse effect in Chapter 16).\n\n14.7.2 Ecosystem – Phosphorus Cycle\n\nPhosphorus is a major constituent of biological membranes, nucleic acids\n\nand cellular energy transfer systems. Many animals also need large\n\nquantities of this element to make shells, bones and teeth. The natural\n\nreservoir of phosphorus is rock, which contains phosphorus in the form\n\nof phosphates. When rocks are weathered, minute amounts of these\n\nphosphates dissolve in soil solution and are absorbed by the roots of the\n\nplants (Figure 14.7). Herbivores and other animals obtain this element\n\nfrom plants. The waste products and the dead organisms are decomposed\n\nby phosphate-solubilising bacteria releasing phosphorus. Unlike carbon\n\ncycle, there is no respiratory release of phosphorus into atmosphere. Can\n\nyou differentiate between the carbon and the phosphorus cycle?\n\nThe other two major and important differences between carbon and\n\nphosphorus cycle are firstly, atmospheric inputs of phosphorus through\n\nrainfall are much smaller than carbon inputs, and, secondly, gaseous\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n255\n\nECOSYSTEM\n\nexchanges of phosphorus between organism and environment are\n\nnegligible.\n\n14.8 ECOSYSTEM SERVICES\n\nHealthy ecosystems are the base for a wide range of economic,\n\nenvironmental and aesthetic goods and services. The products of\n\necosystem processes are named as ecosystem services, for example,\n\nhealthy forest ecosystems purify air and water, mitigate droughts and\n\nfloods, cycle nutrients, generate fertile soils, provide wildlife habitat,\n\nmaintain biodiversity, pollinate crops, provide storage site for carbon\n\nand also provide aesthetic, cultural and spiritual values. Though value\n\nof such services of biodiversity is difficult to determine, it seems\n\nreasonable to think that biodiversity should carry a hefty price tag.\n\nRobert Constanza and his colleagues have very recently tried to\n\nput price tags on nature’s life-support services. Researchers have put\n\nan average price tag of US $ 33 trillion a year on these fundamental\n\necosystems services, which are largely taken for granted because they\n\nare free. This is nearly twice the value of the global gross national\n\nproduct GNP which is (US $ 18 trillion).\n\nOut of the total cost of various ecosystem services, the soil\n\nformation accounts for about 50 per cent, and contributions of other\n\nservices like recreation and nutrient cycling, are less than 10 per\n\ncent each. The cost of climate regulation and habitat for wildlife are\n\nabout 6 per cent each.\n\nFigure 14.7 A simplified model of phosphorus cycling in a terrestrial\necosystem\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n256\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nSUMMARY\n\nAn ecosystem is a structural and functional unit of nature and it\ncomprises abiotic and biotic components. Abiotic components are\ninorganic materials- air, water and soil, whereas biotic components\nare producers, consumers and decomposers. Each ecosystem has\ncharacteristic physical structure resulting from interaction amongst\nabiotic and biotic components. Species composition and stratification\nare the two main structural features of an ecosystem. Based on source\nof nutrition every organism occupies a place in an ecosystem.\n\nProductivity, decomposition, energy flow, and nutrient cycling are\nthe four important components of an ecosystem. Primary productivity\nis the rate of capture of solar energy or biomass production of the\nproducers. It is divided into two types: gross primary productivity (GPP)\nand net primary productivity (NPP). Rate of capture of solar energy or\ntotal production of organic matter is called as GPP. NPP is the remaining\nbiomass or the energy left after utilisation of producers. Secondary\nproductivity is the rate of assimilation of food energy by the consumers.\nIn decomposition, complex organic compounds of detritus are converted\nto carbon dioxide, water and inorganic nutrients by the decomposers.\nDecomposition involves three processes, namely fragmentation of\ndetritus, leaching and catabolism.\n\nEnergy flow is unidirectional. First, plants capture solar energy\nand then, food is transferred from the producers to decomposers.\nOrganisms of different trophic levels in nature are connected to each\nother for food or energy relationship forming a food chain. The storage\nand movement of nutrient elements through the various components\nof the ecosystem is called nutrient cycling; nutrients are repeatedly\nused through this process. Nutrient cycling is of two types—gaseous\nand sedimentary. Atmosphere or hydrosphere is the reservoir for the\ngaseous type of cycle (carbon), whereas Earth’s crust is the reservoir\nfor sedimentary type (phosphorus). Products of ecosystem processes\nare named as ecosystem services, e.g., purification of air and water by\nforests.\n\nThe biotic community is dynamic and undergoes changes with the\npassage of time. These changes are sequentially ordered and constitute\necological succession. Succession begins with invasion of a bare lifeless\narea by pioneers which later pave way for successors and ultimately a\nstable climax community is formed. The climax community remains\nstable as long as the environment remains unchanged.\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1.
