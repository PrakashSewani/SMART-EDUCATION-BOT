Biology is presented either\n\nas botany, zoology and microbiology or as classical and\n\nmodern. The latter is a euphemism for molecular aspects of\n\nbiology. Luckily we have many threads which weave the\n\ndifferent areas of biological information into a unifying\n\nprinciple. Ecology is one such thread which gives us a holistic\n\nperspective to biology. The essence of biological understanding\n\nis to know how organisms, while remaining an individual,\n\ninteract with other organisms and physical habitats as a group\n\nand hence behave like organised wholes, i.e., population,\n\ncommunity, ecosystem or even as the whole biosphere.\n\nEcology explains to us all this. A particular aspect of this is the\n\nstudy of anthropogenic environmental degradation and the\n\nsocio-political issues it has raised. This unit describes as well as\n\ntakes a critical view of the above aspects.\n\nChapter 13\n\nOrganisms and Populations\n\nChapter 14\n\nEcosystem\n\nChapter 15\n\nBiodiversity and Conservation\n\nChapter 16\n\nEnvironmental  Issues\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nRamdeo Misra is revered as the Father of Ecology in India. Born on 26 August\n\n1908,  Ramdeo Misra obtained Ph.D in Ecology (1937) under Prof. W. H. Pearsall,\n\nFRS, from Leeds University in UK. He established  teaching and research  in\n\necology at the Department of Botany of the Banaras Hindu University,\n\nVaranasi. His research laid the foundations for understanding of tropical\n\ncommunities and their succession, environmental responses of plant\n\npopulations and productivity and nutrient cycling in tropical forest and\n\ngrassland ecosystems. Misra formulated the first postgraduate course in\n\necology in India. Over 50 scholars obtained Ph. D degree under his supervision\n\nand moved on to other universities and research institutes to initiate ecology\n\nteaching and research across the country.\n\nHe was honoured with the Fellowships of the Indian National Science\n\nAcademy and World Academy of Arts and Science, and the prestigious Sanjay\n\nGandhi Award in Environment and Ecology. Due to his efforts, the\n\nGovernment of India established the National Committee for Environmental\n\nPlanning and Coordination (1972) which, in later years, paved the way\n\nfor the establishment of the Ministry of Environment and Forests (1984).\n\nRAMDEO MISRA\n(1908-1998)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nOur living world is fascinatingly diverse and amazingly\n\ncomplex.  We can try to understand its complexity by\n\ninvestigating processes at various levels of biological\n\norganisation–macromolecules, cells, tissues, organs,\n\nindividual organisms, population, communities,\n\necosystems and biomes. At any level of biological\n\norganisation we can ask two types of questions – for\n\nexample, when we hear the bulbul singing early morning\n\nin the garden, we may ask – ‘How does the bird sing?’\n\nOr, ‘Why does the bird sing ?’  The ‘how-type’ questions\n\nseek the mechanism behind the process while the ‘why-\n\ntype’ questions seek the significance of the process. For\n\nthe first question in our example, the answer might be in\n\nterms of the operation of the voice box and the vibrating\n\nbone in the bird, whereas for the second question the\n\nanswer may lie in the bird’s need to communicate with its\n\nmate during breeding season. When you observe nature\n\naround you with a scientific frame of mind you will\n\ncertainly come up with many interesting questions of both\n\ntypes - Why are night-blooming flowers generally white?\n\nHow does the bee know which flower has nectar? Why\n\ndoes cactus have so many thorns? How does the chick\n\nspures recognise her own mother?, and so on.\n\nCHAPTER 13\n\nORGANISMS AND POPULATIONS\n\n13.1 Organism and Its\n\nEnvironment\n\n13.2 Populations\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n220\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nYou have already learnt in previous classes that Ecology is a subject\n\nwhich studies the interactions among organisms and between the\n\norganism and its physical (abiotic) environment.\n\nEcology is basically concerned with four levels of biological\n\norganisation – organisms, populations, communities and biomes.  In this\n\nchapter we explore ecology at organismic and population levels.\n\n13.1 ORGANISM AND ITS ENVIRONMENT\n\nEcology at the organismic level is essentially physiological ecology which\n\ntries to understand how different organisms are adapted to their\n\nenvironments in terms of not only survival but also reproduction.  You\n\nmay have learnt in earlier classes how the rotation of  our planet around\n\nthe Sun and the tilt of its axis cause annual variations in the intensity\n\nand duration of temperature, resulting in distinct seasons.  These\n\nvariations together with annual variation in precipitation (remember\n\nprecipitation includes both rain and snow) account for the formation of\n\nmajor biomes such as desert, rain forest and tundra (Figure 13.1).\n\nFigure 13.1 Biome distribution with respect to annual temperature and precipitation\n\nRegional and local variations within each biome lead to the formation of a\n\nwide variety of habitats. Major biomes of India are shown in Figure 13.2.\n\nOn planet Earth, life exists not just in a few favourable habitats but even\n\nin extreme and harsh habitats – scorching Rajasthan desert, rain-soaked\n\nMeghalaya forests, deep ocean trenches, torrential streams, permafrost\n\n(snow laden) polar regions, high mountain tops, thermal springs, and\n\nstinking compost pits, to name a few.  Even our intestine is a unique\n\nhabitat for hundreds of species of microbes.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n221\n\nORGANISMS AND POPULATIONS\n\nWhat are the key elements that lead to so much variation in the\n\nphysical and chemical conditions of different habitats? The most\n\nimportant ones are temperature, water, light and soil.  We must remember\n\nthat the physico-chemical (abiotic) components alone do not characterise\n\nthe habitat of an organism completely; the habitat includes biotic\n\ncomponents also – pathogens, parasites, predators and competitors – of\n\nthe organism with which they interact constantly.  We assume that over a\n\nperiod of time, the organism had through natural selection, evolved\n\nadaptations to optimise its survival and reproduction in its habitat.\n\nEach organism has an invariably defined range of conditions that it\ncan tolerate, diversity in the resources it utilises and a distinct functional\nrole in the ecological system, all these together comprise its niche.\n\n13.1.1 Major Abiotic Factors\n\nTemperature: Temperature is the most important ecologically relevant\n\nenvironmental factor.  You are aware that the average temperature on\n\nland varies seasonally, decreases progressively from the equator towards\n\nthe poles and from plains to the mountain tops. It ranges from subzero\n\nlevels in polar areas and high altitudes to >500C in tropical deserts in\n\nsummer. There are, however, unique habitats such as thermal springs\n\nand deep-sea hydrothermal vents where average temperatures exceed\n\n1000 C.  It is general knowledge that mango trees do not and cannot grow\n\nFigure 13.2 Major biomes of India : (a) Tropical rain forest; (b) Deciduous forest;\n(c) Desert; (d) Sea coast\n\n (a)  (b)\n\n (c)  (d)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n222\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nin temperate countries like Canada and Germany, snow leopards are not\n\nfound in Kerala forests and tuna fish are rarely caught beyond tropical\n\nlatitudes in the ocean. You can appreciate the significance of temperature\n\nto living organisms when you realise that it affects the kinetics of enzymes\n\nand through it the metabolic activity and other physiological functions of\n\nthe organism. A few organisms can tolerate and thrive in a wide range of\n\ntemperatures (they are called eurythermal ), but, a vast majority of them\n\nare restricted to a narrow range of temperatures (such organisms are called\n\nstenothermal ). The levels of thermal tolerance of different species determine\n\nto a large extent their geographical distribution. Can you think of a few\n\neurythermal and stenothermal animals and plants?\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing concern about the gradually\n\nincreasing average global temperatures (Chapter 16). If this trend continues,\n\nwould you expect the distributional range of some species to be affected?\n\nWater: Water is another the most important factor influencing the life of\n\norganisms. In fact, life on earth originated in water and is unsustainable\n\nwithout water. Its availability is so limited in deserts that only special\n\nadaptations make it possible for organisms to live there. The productivity\n\nand distribution of plants is also heavily dependent on water.  You might\n\nthink that organisms living in oceans, lakes and rivers should not face\n\nany water-related problems, but it is not true.  For aquatic organisms the\n\nquality (chemical composition, pH) of water becomes important. The salt\n\nconcentration (measured as salinity in parts per thousand), is less than\n\n5 in inland waters, 30-35 in the sea and > 100 in some hypersaline\n\nlagoons. Some organisms are tolerant of a wide range of salinities\n\n(euryhaline) but others are restricted to a narrow range (stenohaline).\n\nMany freshwater animals cannot live for long in sea water and vice versa\n\nbecause of the osmotic problems, they would face.\n\nLight: Since plants produce food through photosynthesis, a process which\n\nis only possible when sunlight is available as a source of energy, we can\n\nquickly understand the importance of light for living organisms,\n\nparticularly autotrophs.  Many species of small plants (herbs and shrubs)\n\ngrowing in forests are adapted to photosynthesise optimally under very\n\nlow light conditions because they are constantly overshadowed by tall,\n\ncanopied trees. Many plants are also dependent on sunlight to meet their\n\nphotoperiodic requirement for flowering. For many animals too, light is\n\nimportant in that they use the diurnal and seasonal variations in light\n\nintensity and duration (photoperiod) as cues for timing their foraging,\n\nreproductive and migratory activities. The availability of light on land is\n\nclosely linked with that of temperature since the sun is the source for both.\n\nBut, deep (>500m) in the oceans, the environment is  dark and its inhabitants\n\nare not aware of the existence of a celestial source of energy called Sun.\n\nWhat, then is their source of energy?.  The spectral quality of solar radiation\n\nis also important for life.  The UV component of the spectrum is harmful to\n\nmany organisms while not all the colour components of the visible spectrum\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n223\n\nORGANISMS AND POPULATIONS\n\nare available for marine plants living at different depths of the ocean. Among\n\nthe red, green and brown algae that inhabit the sea, which is likely to\n\nbe found in the deepest waters? Why?\n\nSoil: The nature and properties of soil in different places vary; it is\n\ndependent on the climate, the weathering process, whether soil is\n\ntransported or sedimentary and how soil development occurred. Various\n\ncharacteristics of the soil such as soil composition, grain size and\n\naggregation determine the percolation and water holding capacity of the\n\nsoils. These characteristics along with parameters such as pH, mineral\n\ncomposition and topography determine to a large extent the vegetation in\n\nany area. This in turn dictates the type of animals that can be supported.\n\nSimilarly, in the aquatic environment, the sediment-characteristics often\n\ndetermine the type of benthic animals that can thrive there.\n\n13.1.2 Responses to Abiotic Factors\n\nHaving realised that the abiotic conditions of many habitats may vary\n\ndrastically in time, we now ask–how do the organisms living in such\n\nhabitats cope or manage with stressful conditions? But before attempting\n\nto answer this question, we should perhaps ask first why a highly variable\n\nexternal environment should bother organisms after all.  One would expect\n\nthat during the course of millions of years of their existence, many species\n\nwould have evolved a relatively constant internal (within the body)\n\nenvironment that permits all biochemical reactions and physiological\n\nfunctions to proceed with maximal efficiency\n\nand thus, enhance the overall ‘fitness’ of the\n\nspecies.  This constancy, for example, could\n\nbe in terms of optimal temperature and\n\nosmotic concentration of body fluids. Ideally\n\nthen, the organism should try to maintain\n\nthe constancy of its internal environment (a\n\nprocess called homeostasis) despite varying\n\nexternal environmental conditions that tend\n\nto upset its homeostasis.  Let us take an\n\nanalogy to clarify this important concept.\n\nSuppose a person is able to perform his/her\n\nbest when the temperature is 250C and\n\nwishes to maintain it so, even when it is\n\nscorchingly hot or freezingly cold outside. It\n\ncould be achieved at home, in the car while\n\ntravelling, and at workplace by using an air conditioner in summer and\n\nheater in winter. Then his/her performance would be always maximal\n\nregardless of the weather around him/her. Here the person’s homeostasis\n\nis accomplished, not through physiological, but artificial means. How do\n\nother living organisms cope with the situation? Let us look at various\n\npossibilities (Figure 13.3).\n\nFigure 13.3 Diagrammatic representation of\norganismic response\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n224\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n(i) Regulate: Some organisms are able to maintain homeostasis by\n\nphysiological (sometimes behavioural also) means which ensures\n\nconstant body temperature, constant osmotic concentration, etc.\n\nAll birds and mammals, and a very few lower vertebrate and\n\ninvertebrate species are indeed capable of such regulation\n\n(thermoregulation and osmoregulation).  Evolutionary biologists\n\nbelieve that the ‘success’ of mammals is largely due to their ability\n\nto maintain a constant body temperature and thrive whether they\n\nlive in Antarctica or in the Sahara desert.\n\nThe mechanisms used by most mammals to regulate their body\n\ntemperature are similar to the ones that we humans use. We maintain\n\na constant body temperature of 370C. In summer, when outside\n\ntemperature is more than our body temperature, we sweat profusely.\n\nThe resulting evaporative cooling, similar to what happens with a\n\ndesert cooler in operation, brings down the body temperature. In\n\nwinter when the temperature is much lower than 370C, we start to\n\nshiver, a kind of exercise which produces heat and raises the body\n\ntemperature.  Plants, on the other hand, do not have such\n\nmechanisms to maintain internal temperatures.\n\n(ii) Conform: An overwhelming majority (99 per cent) of animals and\n\nnearly all plants cannot maintain a constant internal environment.\n\nTheir body temperature changes with the ambient temperature. In\n\naquatic animals, the osmotic concentration of the body fluids\n\nchange with that of the ambient air, water osmotic concentration.\n\nThese animals and plants are simply conformers. Considering the\n\nbenefits of a constant internal environment to the organism, we must\n\nask why these conformers had not evolved to become regulators.\n\nRecall the human analogy we used above; much as they like, how\n\nmany people can really afford an air conditioner? Many simply\n\n‘sweat it out’ and resign themselves to suboptimal performance in\n\nhot summer months. Thermoregulation is energetically expensive\n\nfor many organisms. This is particularly true for small animals like\n\nshrews and humming birds.  Heat loss or heat gain is a function of\n\nsurface area. Since small animals have a larger surface area relative\n\nto their volume, they tend to lose body heat very fast when it is cold\n\noutside; then they have to expend much energy to generate body\n\nheat through metabolism. This is the main reason why very small\n\nanimals are rarely found in polar regions. During the course of\n\nevolution, the costs and benefits of maintaining a constant internal\n\nenvironment are taken into consideration. Some species have evolved\n\nthe ability to regulate, but only over a limited range of environmental\n\nconditions, beyond which they simply conform.\n\nIf the stressful external conditions are localised or remain only\n\nfor a short duration, the organism has two other alternatives for\n\nsurvival.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n225\n\nORGANISMS AND POPULATIONS\n\n(iii) Migrate : The organism can move away temporarily from the\n\nstressful habitat to a more hospitable area and return when stressful\n\nperiod is over. In human analogy, this strategy is like a person\n\nmoving from Delhi to Shimla for the duration of summer. Many\n\nanimals, particularly birds, during winter undertake long-distance\n\nmigrations to more hospitable areas. Every winter the famous\n\nKeolado National Park (Bharatpur) in Rajasthan host thousands of\n\nmigratory birds coming from Siberia and other extremely cold\n\nnorthern regions.\n\n(iv) Suspend: In bacteria, fungi and lower plants, various kinds of thick-\n\nwalled spores are formed which help them to survive unfavourable\n\nconditions – these germinate on availability of suitable environment.\n\nIn higher plants, seeds and some other vegetative reproductive\n\nstructures serve as means to tide over periods of stress besides helping\n\nin dispersal – they germinate to form new plants under favourable\n\nmoisture and temperature conditions. They do so by reducing their\n\nmetabolic activity and going into a state of ‘dormancy’.\n\nIn animals, the organism, if unable to migrate, might avoid the\n\nstress by escaping in time. The familiar case of bears going into\n\nhibernation during winter is an example of escape in time. Some\n\nsnails and fish go into aestivation to avoid summer–related\n\nproblems-heat and dessication. Under unfavourable conditions\n\nmany zooplankton species in lakes and ponds are known to enter\n\ndiapause, a stage of suspended development.\n\n13.1.3 Adaptations\n\nWhile considering the various alternatives available to organisms for\n\ncoping with extremes in their environment, we have seen that some are\n\nable to respond through certain physiological adjustments while others\n\ndo so behaviourally (migrating temporarily to a less stressful habitat).\n\nThese responses are also actually, their adaptations. So, we can say that\n\nadaptation is any attribute of the organism (morphological, physiological,\n\nbehavioural) that enables the organism to survive and reproduce in its\n\nhabitat. Many adaptations have evolved over a long evolutionary time\n\nand are genetically fixed. In the absence of an external source of water,\n\nthe kangaroo rat in North American deserts is capable of meeting all its\n\nwater requirements through its internal fat oxidation (in which water is\n\na by product).  It also has the ability to concentrate its urine so that\n\nminimal volume of water is used to remove excretory products.\n\nMany desert plants have a thick cuticle on their leaf surfaces and\n\nhave their stomata arranged in deep pits (sunken) to minimise water loss\n\nthrough transpiration.  They also have a special photosynthetic pathway\n\n(CAM) that enables their stomata to remain closed during day time.  Some\n\ndesert plants like Opuntia, have no leaves – they are reduced to spines–\n\nand the photosynthetic function is taken over by the flattened stems.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n226\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nMammals from colder climates generally have shorter ears and limbs\n\nto minimise heat loss. (This is called the Allen’s Rule.)  In the polar seas\n\naquatic mammals like seals have a thick layer of fat (blubber) below their\n\nskin that acts as an insulator and reduces loss of body heat.\n\nSome organisms possess adaptations that are physiological which\n\nallow them to respond quickly to a stressful situation.  If you had ever\n\nbeen to any high altitude place (>3,500m Rohtang Pass near Manali and\n\nLeh you must have experienced what is called altitude sickness.  Its\n\nsymptoms include nausea, fatigue and heart palpitations. This is because\n\nin the low atmospheric pressure of high altitudes, the body does not get\n\nenough oxygen. But, gradually you get acclimatised and stop experiencing\n\naltitude sickness. How did your body solve this problem? The body\n\ncompensates low oxygen availability by increasing red blood cell\n\nproduction, decreasing the binding affinity of hemoglobin and by\n\nincreasing breathing rate. Many tribes live in the high altitude of\n\nHimalayas. Find out if they normally have a higher red blood cell count\n\n(or total hemoglobin) than people living in the plains.\n\nIn most animals, the metabolic reactions and hence all the\n\nphysiological functions proceed optimally in a narrow temperature range\n\n(in humans, it is 370C). But there are microbes (archaebacteria) that\n\nflourish in hot springs and deep sea hydrothermal vents where\n\ntemperatures far exceed 1000C. How is this possible?\n\nMany fish thrive in Antarctic waters where the temperature is always\n\nbelow zero. How do they manage to prevent their body fluids from freezing?\n\nA large variety of marine invertebrates and fish live at great depths in\n\nthe ocean where the pressure could be >100 times the normal atmospheric\n\npressure that we experience. How do they live under such high  pressures\n\nand do they have any special enzymes? Organisms living in such extreme\n\nenvironments show a fascinating array of biochemical adaptations.\n\nSome organisms show behavioural responses to cope up with\n\nvariations in their environment. Desert lizards lack the physiological ability\n\nthat mammals have to deal with the high temperatures of their habitat,\n\nbut manage to keep their body temperature fairly constant by behavioural\n\nmeans.  They bask in the sun and absorb heat when their body\n\ntemperature drops below the comfort zone, but move into shade when\n\nthe ambient temperature starts increasing. Some species are capable of\n\nburrowing into the soil to hide and escape from the above-ground heat.\n\n13.2 POPULATIONS\n\n13.2.1 Population Attributes\n\nIn nature, we rarely find isolated, single individuals of any species; majority\n\nof them live in groups in a well defined geographical area, share or compete\n\nfor similar resources, potentially interbreed and thus constitute a\n\npopulation. Although the term interbreeding implies sexual reproduction,\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n227\n\nORGANISMS AND POPULATIONS\n\na group of individuals resulting from even asexual reproduction is also\n\ngenerally considered a population for the purpose of ecological studies.\n\nAll the cormorants in a wetland, rats in an abandoned dwelling, teakwood\n\ntrees in a forest tract, bacteria in a culture plate and lotus plants in a\n\npond, are some examples of a population.  In earlier chapters you have\n\nlearnt that although an individual organism is the one that has to cope\n\nwith a changed environment, it is at the population level that natural\n\nselection operates to evolve the desired traits. Population ecology is,\n\ntherefore, an important area  because it links ecology to population genetics\n\nand evolution.\n\nA population has certain attributes whereas, an individual organism\n\ndoes not. An individual may have births and deaths, but a population has\n\nbirth rates and death rates. In a population these rates refer to per capita\n\nbirths and deaths. The rates, hence, expressed are change in numbers\n\n(increase or decrease) with respect to members of the population. Here is an\n\nexample. If in a pond there were 20 lotus plants last year and through\n\nreproduction 8 new plants are added, taking the current population to 28,\n\nwe calculate the birth rate as 8/20 = 0.4 offspring per lotus per year. If 4\n\nindividuals in a laboratory population of 40 fruitflies died during a specified\n\ntime interval, say a week, the death rate in the population during that period\n\nis 4/40 = 0.1 individuals per fruitfly per week.\n\nAnother attribute characteristic of a population is sex ratio. An\n\nindividual is either a male or a female but a population has a sex ratio\n\n(e.g., 60 per cent of the population are females and 40 per cent males).\n\nA population at any given time is composed of individuals of\n\ndifferent ages. If the age distribution (per cent individuals of a given\n\nage or age group) is plotted for the population, the resulting structure\n\nis called an age pyramid (Figure 13.4). For human population, the\n\nage pyramids generally show age distribution of males and females in\n\na  diagram. The shape of the pyramids reflects the growth status of\n\nthe population - (a) whether it is growing, (b) stable or (c) declining.\n\nThe size of the population tells us a lot about its status in the habitat.\n\nWhatever ecological processes we wish to investigate in a population, be\n\nit the outcome of competition with another species, the impact of a\n\nFigure 13.4 Representation of age pyramids for human population\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n228\n\nBIOLOGY\n\npredator or the effect of a pesticide application, we always evaluate them\n\nin terms of any change in the population size. The size, in nature, could\n\nbe as low as <10 (Siberian cranes at Bharatpur wetlands in any year) or\n\ngo into millions (Chlamydomonas in a pond). Population size,  technically\n\ncalled population density (designated as N), need not necessarily be\n\nmeasured in numbers only. Although total number is generally the most\n\nappropriate measure of population density, it is in some cases either\n\nmeaningless or difficult to determine.  In an area,  if there are 200 carrot\n\ngrass (Parthenium hysterophorus) plants but only a single huge banyan\n\ntree with a large canopy, stating that the population density of banyan is\n\nlow relative to that of carrot grass amounts to underestimating the\n\nenormous role of the Banyan in that community. In such cases, the per\n\ncent cover or biomass is a more meaningful measure of the population\n\nsize. Total number is again not an easily adoptable measure if the\n\npopulation is huge and counting is impossible or very time-consuming.\n\nIf you have a dense laboratory culture of bacteria  in a petri dish what is\n\nthe best measure to report its density?  Sometimes, for certain ecological\n\ninvestigations, there is no need to know the absolute population densities;\n\nrelative densities serve the purpose equally well.  For instance, the number\n\nof fish caught per trap is good enough measure of its total population\n\ndensity in the lake.  We are mostly obliged to estimate population sizes\n\nindirectly, without actually counting them or seeing them. The tiger census\n\nin our national parks and tiger reserves is often based on pug marks and\n\nfecal pellets.\n\n13.2.2 Population Growth\n\nThe size of a population for any species is not a static parameter.  It keeps\n\nchanging with time, depending on various factors including food\n\navailability, predation pressure and adverse weather.  In fact, it is these\n\nchanges in population density that give us some idea of what is happening\n\nto the population – whether it is flourishing or declining.  Whatever might\n\nbe the ultimate reasons, the density of a population in a given habitat\n\nduring a given period, fluctuates due to changes in four basic processes,\n\ntwo of which (natality and immigration) contribute to an increase in\n\npopulation density and two (mortality and emigration) to a decrease.\n\n(i) Natality refers to the number of births during a given period in the\n\npopulation that are added to the initial density.\n\n(ii) Mortality is the number of deaths in the population during a given\n\nperiod.\n\n(iii) Immigration is the number of individuals of the same species that\n\nhave come into the habitat from elsewhere during the time period\n\nunder consideration.\n\n(iv) Emigration is the number of individuals of the population who\n\nleft the habitat and gone elsewhere during the time period under\n\nconsideration.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n229\n\nORGANISMS AND POPULATIONS\n\nSo, if N is the population density at time t, then its density at time t +1 is\n\nN\nt+1\n\n = N\nt\n + [(B + I) – (D + E)]\n\nYou can see from the above equation (Fig. 13.5) that population\n\ndensity will increase if the number of births plus the number of\n\nimmigrants (B + I) is more than the number of deaths plus the number\n\nof emigrants (D + E).  Under normal conditions, births and deaths are\n\nthe most important factors influencing population density, the other\n\ntwo factors assuming importance only under special conditions.  For\n\ninstance, if a new habitat is just being colonised, immigration may\n\ncontribute more significantly to population growth than birth rates.\n\nGrowth Models : Does the growth of a population with time show any\n\nspecific and predictable pattern? We have been concerned about\n\nunbridled human population growth and problems created by it in our\n\ncountry and it is therefore natural for us to be curious if different animal\n\npopulations in nature behave the same way or show some restraints on\n\ngrowth. Perhaps we can learn a lesson or two from nature on how to\n\ncontrol population growth.\n\n(i) Exponential growth: Resource (food and space) availability is\n\nobviously essential for the unimpeded growth of a population.\n\nIdeally, when resources in the habitat are unlimited, each species\n\nhas the ability to realise fully its innate potential to grow in number,\n\nas Darwin observed while developing his theory of natural\n\nselection. Then the population grows in an exponential or\n\nFigure 13.5\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n230\n\nBIOLOGY\n\ngeometric fashion. If in a population of size N, the birth rates (not\n\ntotal number but per capita births) are represented as b and death\n\nrates (again, per capita death rates) as d, then the increase or\n\ndecrease in N during a unit time period  t  (dN/dt) will be\n\ndN/dt = (b – d) × N\n\nLet (b–d) = r, then\n\ndN/dt = rN\n\nThe r in this equation is called the ‘intrinsic rate of natural increase’\n\nand is a very important parameter chosen for assessing impacts of\n\nany biotic or abiotic factor on population growth.\n\nTo give you some idea about the magnitude of r values, for the\n\nNorway rat the r is 0.015, and for the flour beetle it is 0.12.  In\n\n1981, the r value for human population in India was 0.0205.  Find\n\nout what the current r value is.  For calculating it, you need to\n\nknow the birth rates and death rates.\n\nThe above equation describes the exponential or geometric growth\n\npattern of a population (Figure 13.6) and results in a J-shaped curve\n\nwhen we plot N in relation to time. If you are familiar with basic\n\ncalculus, you can derive the integral form of the\n\nexponential growth equation as\n\nN\nt\n = N\n\n0\n ert\n\n  where\n\nN\nt\n = Population density after time t\n\nN\n0\n = Population density at time zero\n\nr = intrinsic rate of natural increase\n\ne = the base of natural logarithms (2.71828)\n\nAny species growing exponentially under unlimited\n\nresource conditions can reach enormous population\n\ndensities in a short time. Darwin showed how even\n\na slow growing animal like elephant could reach\n\nenormous numbers in the absence of checks. The\n\nfollowing is an anecdote popularly narrated to\n\ndemonstrate dramatically how fast a huge\n\npopulation could build up when growing\n\nexponentially.\n\nThe king and the minister sat for a chess game. The king, confident\n\nof winning the game, was ready to accept any bet proposed by the\n\nminister. The minister humbly said that if he won, he wanted only\n\nsome wheat grains, the quantity of which is to be calculated by placing\n\non the chess board one grain in Square 1, then two in Square 2,\n\nthen four in Square 3, and eight in Square 4, and so on, doubling each\n\ntime the previous quantity of wheat on the next square until all the 64\n\nsquares were filled.  The king accepted the seemingly silly bet and started\n\nFigure 13.6 Population growth curve\na when responses are not\nlimiting the growth, plot is\nexponential,\nb when responses are limiting\nthe growth, plot is logistic,\nK is carrying capacity\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n231\n\nORGANISMS AND POPULATIONS\n\nthe game, but unluckily for him, the minister won. The king felt that fulfilling\n\nthe minister’s bet was so easy.  He started with a single grain on\n\nthe first square and proceeded to fill the other squares following\n\nminister’s suggested procedure, but by the time he covered half the\n\nchess board, the king realised to his dismay that all the wheat\n\nproduced in his entire kingdom pooled together would still be\n\ninadequate to cover all the 64 squares. Now think of a tiny\n\nParamecium starting with just one individual and through binary\n\nfission, doubling in numbers every day, and imagine what a mind-\n\nboggling population size it would reach in 64 days. (provided food\n\nand space remain unlimited)\n\n(ii) Logistic growth: No population of any species in nature has at its\n\ndisposal unlimited resources to permit exponential growth. This\n\nleads to competition between individuals for limited resources.\n\nEventually, the ‘fittest’ individual will survive and reproduce.  The\n\ngovernments of many countries have also realised this fact and\n\nintroduced various restraints with a view to limit human population\n\ngrowth. In nature, a given habitat has enough resources to support\n\na maximum possible number, beyond which no further growth is\n\npossible. Let us call this limit as nature’s carrying capacity (K) for\n\nthat species in that habitat.\n\nA population growing in a habitat with limited resources show\n\ninitially a lag phase, followed by phases of acceleration and\n\ndeceleration and finally an asymptote, when the population density\n\nreaches the carrying capacity. A plot of N in relation to time (t)\n\nresults in a sigmoid curve. This type of population growth is called\n\nVerhulst-Pearl Logistic Growth (Figure 13.6) and is described by\n\nthe following equation:\n\ndN/dt = \nK N\n\nrN\nK\n\n−\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ed \uf8f8\n\nWhere N = Population density at time t\n\nr = Intrinsic rate of natural increase\n\nK = Carrying capacity\n\nSince resources for growth for most animal populations are finite\n\nand become limiting sooner or later, the logistic growth model is\n\nconsidered a more realistic one.\n\nGather from Government Census data the population figures\n\nfor India for the last 100 years, plot them and check which growth\n\npattern is evident.\n\n13.2.3 Life History Variation\n\nPopulations evolve to maximise their reproductive  fitness, also called\n\nDarwinian fitness (high r value), in the habitat in which they live.  Under\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n232\n\nBIOLOGY\n\na particular set of selection pressures, organisms evolve towards the most\n\nefficient reproductive strategy. Some organisms breed only once in their\n\nlifetime (Pacific salmon fish, bamboo) while others breed many times\n\nduring their lifetime (most birds and mammals). Some produce a large\n\nnumber of small-sized offspring (Oysters, pelagic fishes) while others\n\nproduce a small number of large-sized offspring (birds, mammals).  So,\n\nwhich is desirable for maximising fitness?  Ecologists suggest that life\n\nhistory traits of organisms have evolved in relation to the constraints\n\nimposed by the abiotic and biotic components of the habitat in which\n\nthey live. Evolution of life history traits in different species is currently an\n\nimportant area of research being conducted by ecologists.\n\n13.2.4 Population Interactions\n\nCan you think of any natural habitat on earth that is inhabited just by a\n\nsingle species?  There is no such habitat and such a situation is even\n\ninconceivable.  For any species, the minimal requirement is one more\n\nspecies on which it can feed.  Even a plant species, which makes its own\n\nfood, cannot survive alone; it needs soil microbes to break down the organic\n\nmatter in soil and return the inorganic nutrients for absorption. And then,\n\nhow will the plant manage pollination without an animal agent?  It is\n\nobvious that in nature, animals, plants and microbes do not and cannot\n\nlive in isolation but interact in various ways to form a biological\n\ncommunity.  Even in minimal communities, many interactive linkages\n\nexist, although all may not be readily apparent.\n\nInterspecific interactions arise from the interaction of populations of\n\ntwo different species. They could be beneficial, detrimental or neutral\n\n(neither harm nor benefit) to one of the species or both. Assigning a ‘+’\n\nsign for beneficial interaction, ‘-’ sign for detrimental and 0 for neutral\n\ninteraction, let us look at all the possible outcomes of interspecific\n\ninteractions (Table13.1).\n\nBoth the species benefit in mutualism and both lose in competition in\n\ntheir interactions with each other. In both parasitism and predation only\n\none species benefits (parasite and predator, respectively) and the interaction\n\nSpecies A Species B Name of  Interaction\n\n+ + Mutualism\n\n– – Competition\n\n+ – Predation\n\n+ – Parasitism\n\n+ 0 Commensalism\n\n– 0 Amensalism\n\nTable 13.1 : Population Interactions\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n233\n\nORGANISMS AND POPULATIONS\n\nis detrimental to the other species (host and prey, respectively).\n\nThe interaction where one species is benefitted and the other is neither\n\nbenefitted nor harmed is called commensalism. In amensalism on\n\nthe other hand one species is harmed whereas the other is\n\nunaffected. Predation, parasitism and commensalism share a common\n\ncharacteristic– the interacting species live closely together.\n\n(i) Predation: What would happen to all the energy fixed by\n\nautotrophic organisms if the community has no animals to eat the\n\nplants?  You can think of predation as nature’s way of transferring\n\nto higher trophic levels the energy fixed by plants.  When we think\n\nof predator and prey, most probably it is the tiger and the deer that\n\nreadily come to our mind, but a sparrow eating any seed is no less\n\na predator.  Although animals eating plants are categorised\n\nseparately as herbivores, they are, in a broad ecological context,\n\nnot very different from predators.\n\nBesides acting as ‘conduits’ for energy transfer across trophic\n\nlevels, predators play other important roles.  They keep prey\n\npopulations under control. But for predators, prey species could\n\nachieve very high population densities and cause ecosystem\n\ninstability. When certain exotic species are introduced into a\n\ngeographical area, they become invasive and start spreading fast\n\nbecause the invaded land does not have its natural predators. The\n\nprickly pear cactus introduced into Australia in the early 1920’s\n\ncaused havoc by spreading rapidly into millions of hectares of\n\nrangeland.  Finally, the invasive cactus was brought under control\n\nonly after a cactus-feeding predator (a moth) from its natural habitat\n\nwas introduced into the country. Biological control methods adopted\n\nin agricultural pest control are based on the ability of the predator\n\nto regulate prey population. Predators also help in maintaining\n\nspecies diversity in a community, by reducing the intensity of\n\ncompetition among competing prey species.   In the rocky intertidal\n\ncommunities of the American Pacific Coast the starfish Pisaster is\n\nan important predator. In a field experiment, when all the starfish\n\nwere removed from an enclosed intertidal area, more than 10 species\n\nof invertebrates became extinct within a year, because of inter-\n\nspecific competition.\n\nIf a predator is too efficient and overexploits its prey, then the\n\nprey might become extinct and following it, the predator will also\n\nbecome extinct for lack of food. This is the reason why predators in\n\nnature are ‘prudent’. Prey species have evolved various defenses to\n\nlessen the impact of predation.  Some species of insects and frogs\n\nare cryptically-coloured (camouflaged) to avoid being detected easily\n\nby the predator. Some are poisonous and therefore avoided by the\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n234\n\nBIOLOGY\n\npredators.  The Monarch butterfly is highly distasteful to its predator\n\n(bird) because of a special chemical present in its body.\n\nInterestingly, the butterfly acquires this chemical during its\n\ncaterpillar stage by feeding on a poisonous weed.\n\nFor plants, herbivores are the predators. Nearly 25 per cent of\n\nall insects are known to be phytophagous (feeding on plant sap\n\nand other parts of plants).  The problem is particularly severe for\n\nplants because, unlike animals, they cannot run away from their\n\npredators. Plants therefore have evolved an astonishing variety of\n\nmorphological and chemical defences against herbivores. Thorns\n\n(Acacia, Cactus) are the most common morphological means of\n\ndefence. Many plants produce and store chemicals that make the\n\nherbivore sick when they are eaten, inhibit feeding or digestion,\n\ndisrupt its reproduction or even kill it.  You must have seen the\n\nweed Calotropis growing in abandoned fields.  The plant produces\n\nhighly poisonous cardiac glycosides and that is why you never see\n\nany cattle or goats browsing on this plant.  A wide variety of chemical\n\nsubstances that we extract from plants on a commercial scale\n\n(nicotine, caffeine, quinine, strychnine, opium, etc.,) are produced\n\nby them actually as defences against grazers and browsers.\n\n(ii) Competition: When Darwin spoke of the struggle for existence and\n\nsurvival of the fittest in nature, he was convinced that interspecific\n\ncompetition is a potent force in organic evolution. It is generally\n\nbelieved that competition occurs when closely related species\n\ncompete for the same resources that are limiting, but this is not\n\nentirely true. Firstly, totally unrelated species could also compete\n\nfor the same resource. For instance, in some shallow South\n\nAmerican lakes, visiting flamingoes and resident fishes compete for\n\ntheir common food, the zooplankton in the lake. Secondly,\n\nresources need not be limiting for competition to occur; in\n\ninterference competition, the feeding efficiency of one species might\n\nbe reduced due to the interfering and inhibitory presence of the\n\nother species, even if resources (food and space) are abundant.\n\nTherefore, competition is best defined as a process in which the\n\nfitness of one species (measured in terms of its ‘r’ the intrinsic rate\n\nof increase) is significantly lower in the presence of another species.\n\nIt is relatively easy to demonstrate in laboratory experiments, as\n\nGause and other experimental ecologists did,  when resources are\n\nlimited the competitively superior species will eventually eliminate\n\nthe other species, but evidence for such competitive exclusion\n\noccurring in nature is not always conclusive.  Strong and persuasive\n\ncircumstantial evidence does exist however in some cases. The\n\nAbingdon tortoise in Galapagos Islands became extinct within a\n\ndecade after goats were introduced on the island, apparently due\n\nto the greater browsing efficiency of the goats. Another evidence for\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n235\n\nORGANISMS AND POPULATIONS\n\nthe occurrence of competition in nature comes from what is called\n\n‘competitive release’. A species whose distribution is restricted to a\n\nsmall geographical area because of the presence of a competitively\n\nsuperior species, is found to expand its distributional range\n\ndramatically when the competing species is experimentally removed.\n\nConnell’s elegant field experiments showed that on the rocky sea\n\ncoasts of Scotland, the larger and competitively superior barnacle\n\nBalanus dominates the intertidal area, and excludes the smaller\n\nbarnacle Chathamalus from that zone.  In general, herbivores and\n\nplants appear to be more adversely affected by competition than\n\ncarnivores.\n\nGause’s ‘Competitive Exclusion Principle’ states that two\n\nclosely related species competing for the same resources cannot\n\nco-exist indefinitely and the competitively inferior one will be\n\neliminated eventually. This may be true if resources are limiting,\n\nbut not otherwise. More recent studies do not support such gross\n\ngeneralisations about competition.  While they do not rule out the\n\noccurrence of interspecific competition in nature, they point out\n\nthat species facing competition might evolve mechanisms that\n\npromote co-existence rather than exclusion. One such mechanism\n\nis ‘resource partitioning’. If two species compete for the same\n\nresource, they could avoid competition by choosing, for instance,\n\ndifferent times for   feeding or different foraging patterns.  MacArthur\n\nshowed that five closely related species of warblers living on the\n\nsame tree were able to avoid competition and co-exist due to\n\nbehavioural differences in their foraging activities.\n\n(iii) Parasitism: Considering that the parasitic mode of life ensures\n\nfree lodging and meals, it is not surprising that parasitism has\n\nevolved in so many taxonomic groups from plants to higher\n\nvertebrates.  Many parasites have evolved to be host-specific (they\n\ncan parasitise only a single species of host) in such a way that both\n\nhost and the parasite tend to co-evolve; that is, if the host evolves\n\nspecial mechanisms for rejecting or resisting the parasite, the\n\nparasite has to evolve mechanisms to counteract and neutralise\n\nthem, in order to be successful with the same host species. In\n\naccordance with their life styles, parasites evolved special\n\nadaptations such as the loss of unnecessary sense organs, presence\n\nof adhesive organs or suckers to cling on to the host, loss of digestive\n\nsystem and high reproductive capacity. The life cycles of parasites\n\nare often complex, involving one or two intermediate hosts or vectors\n\nto facilitate parasitisation of its primary host. The human liver fluke\n\n(a trematode parasite) depends on two intermediate hosts (a snail\n\nand a fish) to complete its life cycle.  The malarial parasite needs a\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n236\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nvector (mosquito) to spread to other hosts.  Majority of the parasites\n\nharm the host; they may reduce the survival, growth and\n\nreproduction of the host and reduce its population density. They\n\nmight render the host more vulnerable to predation by making it\n\nphysically weak. Do you believe that an ideal parasite should be\n\nable to thrive within the host without harming it? Then why didn’t\n\nnatural selection lead to the evolution of such totally harmless\n\nparasites?\n\nParasites that feed on the external surface of the host organism\n\nare called ectoparasites. The most familiar examples of this group\n\nare the lice on humans and ticks on dogs. Many marine fish are\n\ninfested with ectoparasitic copepods. Cuscuta, a parasitic plant that\n\nis commonly found growing on hedge plants, has lost its chlorophyll\n\nand leaves in the course of evolution. It derives its nutrition from\n\nthe host plant which it parasitises. The female mosquito is not\n\nconsidered a parasite, although it needs our blood for reproduction.\n\nCan you explain why?\n\nIn contrast, endoparasites are those that live inside the host\n\nbody at different sites (liver, kidney, lungs, red blood cells, etc.).\n\nThe life cycles of endoparasites are more complex because of their\n\nextreme specialisation. Their morphological and anatomical features\n\nare greatly simplified while emphasising their reproductive potential.\n\nBrood parasitism in birds is a fascinating example of parasitism\n\nin which the parasitic bird lays its eggs in the nest of its host and\n\nlets the host incubate them. During the course of evolution, the\n\neggs of the parasitic bird have evolved to resemble the host’s egg in\n\nsize and colour to reduce the chances of the host bird detecting the\n\nforeign eggs and ejecting them from the nest. Try to follow the\n\nmovements of the cuckoo (koel) and the crow in your neighborhood\n\npark during the breeding season (spring to summer) and watch\n\nbrood parasitism in action.\n\n(iv) Commensalism: This is the interaction in which one species benefits\n\nand the other is neither harmed nor benefited. An orchid growing\n\nas an epiphyte on a mango branch, and barnacles growing on the\n\nback of a whale benefit while neither the mango tree nor the whale\n\nderives any apparent benefit.   The cattle egret and grazing cattle in\n\nclose association, a sight you are most likely to catch if you live in\n\nfarmed rural areas, is a classic example of commensalism.  The\n\negrets always forage close to where the cattle are grazing because\n\nthe cattle, as they move, stir up and flush out insects from the\n\nvegetation  that otherwise might be difficult for the egrets to find\n\nand catch.  Another example of commensalism is the interaction\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n237\n\nORGANISMS AND POPULATIONS\n\nbetween sea anemone that has stinging tentacles and the clown\n\nfish that lives among them.  The fish gets protection from predators\n\nwhich stay away from the stinging tentacles. The anemone does\n\nnot appear to derive any benefit by hosting the clown fish.\n\n(v) Mutualism: This interaction confers benefits on both the interacting\n\nspecies. Lichens represent an intimate mutualistic relationship\n\nbetween a fungus and photosynthesising algae or cyanobacteria.\n\nSimilarly, the mycorrhizae are associations between fungi and the\n\nroots of higher plants. The fungi help the plant in the absorption of\n\nessential nutrients from the soil while the plant in turn provides the\n\nfungi with energy-yielding carbohydrates.\n\nThe most spectacular and evolutionarily fascinating examples\n\nof mutualism are found in plant-animal relationships.  Plants need\n\nthe help of animals for pollinating their flowers and dispersing their\n\nseeds.  Animals obviously have to be paid ‘fees’ for the services that\n\nplants expect from them.  Plants offer rewards or fees in the form of\n\npollen and nectar for pollinators and juicy and nutritious fruits for\n\nseed dispersers.  But the mutually beneficial system should also\n\nbe safeguarded against ‘cheaters’, for example, animals that try to\n\nsteal nectar without aiding in pollination. Now you can see why\n\nplant-animal interactions often involve co-evolution of the\n\nmutualists, that is, the evolutions of the flower and its pollinator\n\nspecies are tightly linked with one another. In many species of fig\n\ntrees, there is a tight one-to-one relationship with the pollinator\n\nspecies of wasp (Figure 13.7).  It means that a given fig species can\n\nbe pollinated only by its ‘partner’ wasp species and no other species.\n\nThe female wasp uses the fruit not only as an oviposition (egg-laying)\n\nsite but uses the developing seeds within the fruit for nourishing\n\nFigure 13.7 Mutual relationship between fig tree and wasp: (a) Fig flower is pollinated\nby wasp; (b) Wasp laying eggs in a fig fruit\n\n(a) (b)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n238\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nits larvae.  The wasp pollinates the fig inflorescence while\n\nsearching for suitable egg-laying sites. In return for the\n\nfavour of pollination the fig offers the wasp some of its\n\ndeveloping seeds, as food for the developing wasp larvae.\n\nOrchids show a bewildering diversity of floral\n\npatterns many of which have evolved to attract the right\n\npollinator insect (bees and bumblebees) and ensure\n\nguaranteed pollination by it (Figure 13.8). Not all\n\norchids offer rewards. The Mediterranean orchid\n\nOphrys employs ‘sexual deceit’ to get pollination done\n\nby a species of bee.  One petal of its flower bears an\n\nuncanny resemblance to the female of the bee in size,\n\ncolour and markings. The male bee is attracted to what\n\nit perceives as a female, ‘pseudocopulates’ with the\n\nflower, and during that process is dusted with pollen\n\nfrom the flower. When this same bee ‘pseudocopulates’\n\nwith another flower, it transfers pollen to it and thus,\n\npollinates the flower. Here you can see how co-evolution\n\noperates. If the female bee’s colour patterns change even slightly for any\n\nreason during evolution, pollination success will be reduced unless the\n\norchid flower co-evolves to maintain the resemblance of its petal to the\n\nfemale bee.\n\nFigure 13.8 Showing bee-a pollinator\non orchid flower\n\nSUMMARY\n\nAs a branch of biology, Ecology is the study of the relationships of\n\nliving organisms with the abiotic (physico-chemical factors) and biotic\n\ncomponents (other species) of their environment. It is concerned\n\nwith four levels of biological organisation-organisms, populations,\n\ncommunities and biomes.\n\nTemperature, light, water and soil are the most important\n\nphysical factors of the environment to which the organisms are\n\nadapted in various ways. Maintenance of a constant internal\n\nenvironment (homeostasis) by the organisms contributes to optimal\n\nperformance, but only some organisms (regulators) are capable of\n\nhomeostasis in the face of changing external environment. Others\n\neither partially regulate their internal environment or simply\n\nconform. A few other species have evolved adaptations to avoid\n\nunfavourable conditions in space (migration) or in time (aestivation,\n\nhibernation, and diapause).\n\nEvolutionary changes through natural selection take place at\n\nthe population level and hence, population ecology is an important\n\narea of ecology. A population is a group of individuals of a given\n\nspecies sharing or competing for similar resources in a defined\n\ngeographical area. Populations have attributes that individual\n\norganisms do not- birth rates and death rates, sex ratio and age\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n239\n\nORGANISMS AND POPULATIONS\n\ndistribution. The proportion of different age groups of males and\n\nfemales in a population is often presented graphically as age pyramid;\n\nits shape indicates whether a population is stationary, growing or\n\ndeclining.\n\nEcological effects of any factors on a population are generally\n\nreflected in its size (population density), which may be expressed in\n\ndifferent ways (numbers, biomass, per cent cover, etc.,) depending\n\non the species.\n\nPopulations grow through births and immigration and decline\n\nthrough deaths and emigration.  When resources are unlimited, the\n\ngrowth is usually exponential but when resources become\n\nprogressively limiting, the growth pattern turns logistic. In either\n\ncase, growth is ultimately limited by the carrying capacity of the\n\nenvironment. The intrinsic rate of natural increase (r) is a measure\n\nof the inherent potential of a population to grow.\n\nIn nature populations of different species in a habitat do not live\n\nin isolation but interact in many ways.  Depending on the outcome,\n\nthese interactions between two species are classified as competition\n\n(both species suffer), predation and parasitism (one benefits and the\n\nother suffers), commensalism (one benefits and the other is\n\nunaffected), amensalism (one is harmed, other unaffected) and\n\nmutualism (both species benefit).  Predation is a very important\n\nprocess through which trophic energy transfer is facilitated and some\n\npredators help in controlling their prey populations. Plants have\n\nevolved diverse morphological and chemical defenses against\n\nherbivory.  In competition, it is presumed that the superior competitor\n\neliminates the inferior one (the Competitive Exclusion Principle), but\n\nmany closely related species have evolved various mechanisms which\n\nfacilitate their co-existence. Some of the most fascinating cases of\n\nmutualism in nature are seen in plant-pollinator interactions.\n\nEXERCISES\n1. How is diapause different from hibernation?\n\n2.
