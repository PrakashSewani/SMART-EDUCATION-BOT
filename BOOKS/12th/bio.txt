While individual\n\norganisms die without fail, species continue to live through\n\nmillions of years unless threatened by natural or anthropogenic\n\nextinction. Reproduction becomes a vital process without\n\nwhich species cannot survive for long. Each individual leaves\n\nits progeny by asexual or sexual means. Sexual mode of\n\nreproduction enables creation of new variants, so that survival\n\nadvantage is enhanced. This unit examines the general\n\nprinciples underlying reproductive processes in living organisms\n\nand then explains the details of this process in flowering plants\n\nand humans as easy to relate representative examples. A related\n\nperspective on human reproductive health and how\n\nreproductive ill health can be avoided is also presented to\n\ncomplete our understanding of biology of reproduction.\n\nChapter 1\n\nReproduction in Organisms\n\nChapter 2\n\nSexual Reproduction in\n\nflowering Plants\n\nChapter 3\n\nHuman Reproduction\n\nChapter 4\n\nReproductive Health\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPANCHANAN MAHESHWARI\n\n(1904-1966)\n\nBorn in November 1904 in Jaipur (Rajasthan) Panchanan Maheshwari\n\nrose to become one of the most distinguished botanists not only of India\n\nbut of the entire world. He moved to Allahabad for higher education\n\nwhere he obtained his D.Sc. During his college days, he was inspired\n\nby Dr W. Dudgeon, an American missionary teacher, to develop interest\n\nin Botany and especially morphology. His teacher once expressed that\n\nif his student progresses ahead of him, it will give him a great satisfaction.\n\nThese words encouraged Panchanan to enquire what he could do for\n\nhis teacher in return.\n\nHe worked on embryological aspects and popularised the use of\n\nembryological characters in taxonomy. He established the Department\n\nof Botany, University of Delhi as an important centre of research in\n\nembryology and tissue culture. He also emphasised the need for initiation\n\nof work on artificial culture of immature embryos. These days, tissue\n\nculture has become a landmark in science. His work on test tube\n\nfertilisation and intra-ovarian pollination won worldwide acclaim.\n\nHe was honoured with fellowship of Royal Society of London (FRS),\n\nIndian National Science Academy and several other institutions of\n\nexcellence. He encouraged general education and made a significant\n\ncontribution to school education by his leadership in bringing out the\n\nvery first textbooks of Biology for Higher Secondary Schools published\n\nby NCERT in 1964.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nEach and every organism can live only for a certain period\n\nof time. The period from birth to the natural death of an\n\norganism represents its life span. Life spans of a few\n\norganisms are given in Figure 1.1. Several other organisms\n\nare drawn for which you should find out their life spans\n\nand write in the spaces provided.  Examine the life spans\n\nof organisms represented in the Figure 1.1. Isn’t it both\n\ninteresting and intriguing to note that it may be as short\n\nas a few days or as long as a few thousand years?  Between\n\nthese two extremes are the life spans of most other living\n\norganisms. You may note that life spans of organisms are\n\nnot necessarily correlated with their sizes; the sizes of\n\ncrows and parrots are not very different yet their life spans\n\nshow a wide difference. Similarly, a mango tree has a much\n\nshorter life span as compared to a peepal tree. Whatever\n\nbe the life span, death of every individual organism is a\n\ncertainty, i.e., no individual is immortal, except single-celled\n\norganisms. Why do we say there is no natural death in\n\nsingle-celled organisms? Given this reality, have you ever\n\nwondered how vast number of plant and animal species\n\nhave existed on earth for several thousands of years?  There\n\nmust be some processes in living organisms that ensure\n\nthis continuity.  Yes, we are talking about reproduction,\n\nsomething that we take for granted.\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nREPRODUCTION IN ORGANISMS\n\n1.1 Asexual\n\nReproduction\n\n1.2 Sexual\n\nReproduction\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n4\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nFigure 1.1 Approximate life spans of some organisms\n\n4\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n5\n\nREPRODUCTION IN ORGANISMS\n\nReproduction is defined as a biological process in which an\n\norganism gives rise to young ones (offspring) similar to itself. The offspring\n\ngrow, mature and in turn produce new offspring. Thus, there is a cycle\n\nof birth, growth and death. Reproduction enables the continuity of the\n\nspecies, generation after generation. You will study later in Chapter 5\n\n(Principles of Inheritance and Variation) how genetic variation is created\n\nand inherited during reproduction.\n\nThere is a large diversity in the biological world and each organism\n\nhas evolved its own mechanism to multiply and produce offspring.\n\nThe organism’s habitat, its internal physiology and several other factors\n\nare collectively responsible for how it reproduces.  Based on whether\n\nthere is participation of one organism or two in the process of\n\nreproduction, it is of two types. When offspring is produced by a single\n\nparent with or without the involvement of gamete formation, the\n\nreproduction is asexual. When two parents (opposite sex) participate in\n\nthe reproductive process and also involve fusion of male and female\n\ngametes, it is called sexual reproduction.\n\n1.1  ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION\n\nIn this method, a single individual (parent) is capable of producing\n\noffspring. As a result, the offspring that are produced are not only\n\nidentical to one another but are also exact copies of their parent.\n\nAre these offspring likely to be genetically identical or different?\n\nThe term clone is used to describe such morphologically and\n\ngenetically similar individuals.\n\nFigure 1.2 Cell division in unicellular organism: (a) Budding in\nyeast; (b) Binary fission in Amoeba\n\n(b)(a)\n\nLet us see how widespread asexual reproduction is, among different\n\ngroups of organisms. Asexual reproduction is common among\n\nsingle-celled organisms, and in plants and animals with relatively simple\n\norganisations. In Protists and Monerans, the organism or the parent\n\ncell divides by mitosis into two to give rise to new individuals (Figure1.2).\n\nThus, in these organisms cell division is itself a mode of reproduction.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n6\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nMany single-celled organisms reproduce by binary fission, where a\n\ncell divides into two halves and each rapidly grows into an adult (e.g.,\n\nAmoeba, Paramecium). In yeast, the division is unequal and small\n\nbuds are produced that remain attached initially to the parent cell\n\nwhich, eventually gets separated and  mature into new yeast\n\norganisms (cells). Under unfavourable condition the Amoeba withdraws\n\nits pseudopodia and secretes a three-layered hard covering or cyst\n\naround itself. This phenomenon is termed as encystation. When\n\nfavourable conditions return, the encysted Amoeba divides by multiple\n\nfission and produces many minute amoeba or pseudopodiospores;\n\nthe cyst wall bursts out, and the spores are liberated in the surrounding\n\nmedium to grow up into many amoebae. This phenomenon is\n\nknown as sporulation.\n\nFigure1.3 Asexual reproductive structures: (a) Zoospores of Chlamydomonas; (b) Conidia of\nPenicillium; (c) Buds in Hydra ; (d) Gemmules in sponge\n\n(d)\n\n(a)\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n7\n\nREPRODUCTION IN ORGANISMS\n\nMembers of the Kingdom Fungi and simple plants such as algae\nreproduce through special asexual reproductive structures (Figure 1.3).\nThe most common of these structures are zoospores that usually are\nmicroscopic motile structures.  Other common asexual reproductive\nstructures are conidia (Penicillium), buds (Hydra) and gemmules (sponge).\n\nYou have learnt about vegetative reproduction in plants in Class XI.\n\nWhat do you think – Is vegetative reproduction also a type of asexual\n\nreproduction? Why do you say so? Is the term clone applicable to the\n\noffspring formed by vegetative reproduction?\n\nWhile in animals and other simple organisms the term asexual is used\nunambiguously, in plants, the term vegetative reproduction is frequently\nused. In plants, the units of vegetative propagation such as runner,\n\nrhizome, sucker, tuber, offset, bulb are all capable of giving rise to new\n\noffspring (Figure1.4). These structures are called vegetative propagules.\n\nFigure 1.4 Vegetative propagules in angiosperms: (a) Eyes of potato; (b) Rhizome of ginger;\n(c) Bulbil of Agave; (d) Leaf buds of Bryophyllum; (e) Offset of water hyacinth\n\nAdventitious\nBuds\n\n(a)\n\n(c) (d)\n(e)\n\n(b)\n\nBuds\n\nNodes\n\nAdventitious\nRoot\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n8\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nObviously, since the formation of these structures does not involve two\n\nparents, the process involved is asexual. In some organisms, if the body\n\nbreaks into distinct pieces (fragments) each fragment grows into an\n\nadult capable of producing offspring (e.g., Hydra). This is also a mode\n\nof asexual reproduction called fragmentation.\n\nYou must have heard about the scourge of the water bodies or about\n\nthe ‘terror of Bengal’. This is nothing but the aquatic plant ‘water hyacinth’\n\nwhich is one of the most invasive weeds found growing wherever there is\n\nstanding water. It drains oxygen from the water, which leads to death of\n\nfishes.  You will learn more about it in Chapters 13 and 14. You may find\n\nit interesting to know that this plant was introduced in India because of\n\nits beautiful flowers and shape of leaves.  Since it can propagate vegetatively\n\nat a phenomenal rate and spread all over the water body in a short period\n\nof time, it is very difficult to get rid off them.\n\nAre you aware how plants like potato, sugarcane, banana, ginger,\n\ndahlia are cultivated?  Have you seen small plants emerging from the\n\nbuds (called eyes) of the potato tuber, from the rhizomes of banana and\n\nginger? When you carefully try to determine the site of origin of the new\n\nplantlets in the plants listed above, you will notice that they invariably\n\narise from the nodes present in the modified stems of these plants. When\n\nthe nodes come in contact with damp soil or water, they produce roots\n\nand new plants. Similarly, adventitious buds arise from the notches\n\npresent at margins of leaves of Bryophyllum.  This ability is fully exploited\n\nby gardeners and farmers for commercial propagation of such plants.\n\nIt is interesting to note that asexual reproduction is the common method\n\nof reproduction in organisms that have a relatively simple organisation,\n\nlike algae and fungi and that they shift to sexual method of reproduction\n\njust before the onset of adverse conditions.  Find out how sexual\n\nreproduction enables these organisms to survive during unfavourable\n\nconditions? Why is sexual reproduction favoured under such conditions?\n\nAsexual (vegetative) as well as sexual modes of reproduction are exhibited\n\nby the higher plants. On the other hand, only sexual mode of reproduction\n\nis present in most of the animals.\n\n1.2 SEXUAL REPRODUCTION\n\nSexual reproduction involves formation of the male and female gametes,\n\neither by the same individual or by different individuals of the opposite\n\nsex. These gametes fuse to form the zygote which develops to form the\n\nnew organism. It is an elaborate, complex and slow process as compared\n\nto asexual reproduction. Because of the fusion of male and female gametes,\n\nsexual reproduction results in offspring that are not identical to the parents\n\nor amongst themselves.\n\nA study of diverse organisms–plants, animals or fungi–show that\n\nthough they differ so greatly in external morphology, internal structure\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n9\n\nREPRODUCTION IN ORGANISMS\n\nand physiology, when it comes to sexual mode of reproduction,\n\nsurprisingly, they share a similar pattern. Let us first discuss what features\n\nare common to these diverse organisms.\n\nAll organisms have to reach a certain stage of growth and maturity in\n\ntheir life, before they can reproduce sexually. That period of growth is\n\ncalled the juvenile phase. It is known as vegetative phase in plants.\n\nThis phase is of variable durations in different organisms.\n\nThe end of juvenile/vegetative phase which marks the beginning of\n\nthe reproductive phase can be seen easily in the higher plants when they\n\ncome to flower. How long does it take for marigold/rice/wheat/coconut/\n\nmango plants to come to flower?  In some plants, where flowering occurs\n\nmore than once, what would you call the inter-flowering period – juvenile\n\nor mature?\n\nObserve a few trees in your area. Do they flower during the same\n\nmonth year after year? Why do you think the availability of fruits like\n\nmango, apple, jackfruit, etc., is seasonal? Are there some plants that flower\n\nthroughout the year and some others that show seasonal flowering?\n\nPlants–the annual and biennial types, show clear cut vegetative,\n\nreproductive and senescent phases, but in the perennial species it is very\n\ndifficult to clearly define these phases. A few plants exhibit unusual\n\nflowering phenomenon; some of them such as bamboo species flower only\n\nonce in their life time, generally after 50-100 years, produce large number\n\nof fruits  and die. Another plant, Strobilanthus kunthiana (neelakuranji),\n\nflowers once in 12 years. As many of you would know, this plant flowered\n\nduring September-October 2006. Its mass flowering transformed large\n\ntracks of hilly areas in Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu into blue\n\nstretches and attracted a large number of tourists. In animals, the juvenile\n\nphase is followed by morphological and physiological changes prior to\n\nactive reproductive behaviour. The reproductive phase is also of variable\n\nduration in different organisms.\n\nCan you list the changes seen in human beings that are indicative\n\nof reproductive maturity?\n\nAmong animals, for example birds, do they lay eggs all through the\n\nyear? Or is it a seasonal phenomenon? What about other animals like\n\nfrogs and lizards? You will notice that, birds living in nature lay eggs only\n\nseasonally. However, birds in captivity (as in poultry farms) can be made\n\nto lay eggs throughout the year. In this case, laying eggs is not related to\n\nreproduction but is a commercial exploitation for human welfare.  The\n\nfemales of placental mammals exhibit cyclical changes in the activities of\n\novaries and accessory ducts as well as hormones during the reproductive\n\nphase. In non-primate mammals like cows, sheep, rats, deers, dogs, tiger,\n\netc., such cyclical changes during reproduction are called oestrus cycle\n\nwhere as in primates (monkeys, apes, and humans) it is called menstrual\n\ncycle. Many mammals, especially those living in natural, wild conditions\n\nexhibit such cycles only during favourable seasons in their reproductive\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n10\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n(a) (b) (c)\n\nFigure 1.5 Types of gametes: (a) Isogametes of Cladophora (an alga); (b) Heterogametes of\nFucus (an alga); (c) Heterogametes of Homo sapiens (Human beings)\n\nphase and are therefore called seasonal breeders. Many other mammals\n\nare reproductively active throughout their reproductive phase and hence\n\nare called continuous breeders.\n\nThat we all grow old (if we live long enough), is something that we\n\nrecognise. But what is meant by growing old? The end of reproductive\n\nphase can be considered as one of the parameters of senescence or old\n\nage. There are concomitant changes in the body (like slowing of\n\nmetabolism, etc.) during this last phase of life span. Old age ultimately\n\nleads to death.\n\nIn both plants and animals, hormones are responsible for the\n\ntransitions between the three phases. Interaction between hormones and\n\ncertain environmental factors regulate the reproductive processes and\n\nthe associated behavioural expressions of organisms.\n\nEvents in sexual reproduction : After attainment of maturity, all sexually\n\nreproducing organisms exhibit events and processes that have remarkable\n\nfundamental similarity, even though the structures associated with sexual\n\nreproduction are indeed very different. The events of sexual reproduction\n\nthough elaborate and complex, follow a regular sequence. Sexual\n\nreproduction is characterised by the fusion (or fertilisation) of the male and\n\nfemale gametes, the formation of zygote and embryogenesis. For convenience\n\nthese sequential events may be grouped into three distinct stages namely,\n\nthe pre-fertilisation, fertilisation and the post-fertilisation events.\n\n1.2.1 Pre-fertilisation Events\n\nThese include all the events of sexual reproduction prior to the fusion of\n\ngametes.  The two main pre-fertilisation events are gametogenesis and\n\ngamete transfer.\n\n1.2.1.1 Gametogenesis\n\nAs you are already aware, gametogenesis refers to the process of formation\n\nof the two types of gametes – male and female. Gametes are haploid cells.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n11\n\nREPRODUCTION IN ORGANISMS\n\nIn some algae the two gametes are so similar in appearance\n\nthat it is not possible to categorise them into male and female gametes.\n\nThey are hence called homogametes (isogametes) (Figure 1.5a).\n\nHowever, in a majority of sexually reproducing organisms the gametes\n\nproduced are of two morphologically distinct types (heterogametes).  In\n\nsuch organisms the male gamete is called the antherozoid or sperm\n\nand the female gamete is called the egg or ovum (Figure1.5 b, c).\n\nSexuality in organisms: Sexual reproduction in organisms generally\n\ninvolves the fusion of gametes from two different individuals. But this\n\nis not always true.  From your recollection of examples studied in\n\nClass XI, can you identify cases where self-fertilisation is observed? Of\n\ncourse, citing such examples in plants is easy.\n\nPlants may have both male and female reproductive structures in the\n\nsame plant (bisexual) (Figure 1.6 c, e) or on different plants  (unisexual)\n\n(Figure 1.6d). In several fungi and plants, terms such as homothallic\n\nand monoecious are used to denote the bisexual condition and\n\nheterothallic and dioecious are the terms used to describe unisexual\n\ncondition. In flowering plants, the unisexual male flower is staminate,\n\ni.e., bearing stamens, while the female is pistillate or bearing pistils. In\n\nsome flowering plants, both male and female flowers  may be present on\n\nthe same individual (monoecious) or on separate individuals (dioecious).\n\nSome examples of monoecious plants are  cucurbits and coconuts and of\n\ndioecious plants are papaya and date palm. Name the type of gametes\n\nthat are formed in staminate and pistillate flowers.\n\nBut what about animals?  Are individuals of all species either male or\n\nfemale (unisexual)? Or are there species which possess both the\n\nreproductive organs (bisexual)? You probably can make a list\n\nof several unisexual animal species. Earthworms, (Figure 1.6a) sponge,\n\ntapeworm and leech, typical examples of bisexual animals that possess\n\nboth male and female reproductive organs, are hermaphrodites.\n\nCockroach (Figure 1.6b) is an example of a unisexual species.\n\nCell division during gamete formation : Gametes in all heterogametic\n\nspecies are of two types namely, male and female. Gametes are haploid\n\nthough the parent plant body from which they arise may be either haploid\n\nor diploid. A haploid parent produces gametes by mitotic division.  Does\n\nthis mean that meiosis never occurs in organisms that are haploid?\n\nCarefully examine the flow charts of life cycles of algae that you have\n\nstudied in Class XI (Chapter 3) to get a suitable answer.\n\nSeveral organisms belonging to monera, fungi, algae and bryophytes\n\nhave haploid plant body, but in organisms belonging to pteridophytes,\n\ngymnosperms, angiosperms and most of the animals including human\n\nbeings, the parental body is diploid.  It is obvious that meiosis, the reduction\n\ndivision, has to occur if a diploid body has to produce haploid gametes.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n12\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nFigure 1.6 Diversity of sexuality in organisms (a) Bisexual animal (Earthworm); (b) Unisexual\nanimal (Cockroach); (c) Monoecious plant (Chara); (d) Dioecious plant (Marchantia);\n(e) Bisexual flower (sweet potato)\n\n(b)\n\nMale\n\nFemale\n\nTestis sac\nwith testis\n\nOvary\n\nClitellum\n\n(a)\n\nTestis\n\nOvary\n\nFemale thallus\n\nAntheridiophore\n\nMale thallus\n\nArchegoniophore\n\n(c)\n\n(d) (e)\n\n\n\n13\n\nREPRODUCTION IN ORGANISMS\n\nTable 1.1: Chromosome Numbers in Meiocytes (diploid, 2n) and Gametes\n\n(haploid, n) of Some Organisms.

At the end of meiosis, only one set of chromosomes\n\ngets incorporated into each gamete.  Carefully study Table 1.1 and fill in\n\nthe diploid and haploid chromosome numbers of organisms.  Is there any\n\nrelationship in the number of chromosomes of meiocytes and gametes?\n\n1.2.1.2 Gamete Transfer\n\nAfter their formation, male and female gametes must be physically\n\nbrought together to facilitate fusion (fertilisation). Have you ever\n\nwondered how the gametes meet? In a majority of organisms, male\n\ngamete is motile and the female gamete is stationary. Exceptions are a\n\nfew fungi and algae in which both types of gametes are motile\n\n(Figure1.7a). There is a need for a medium through which the male\n\ngametes move. In several simple plants like algae, bryophytes and\n\npteridophytes, water is the medium through which this gamete transfer\n\ntakes place. A large number of the male gametes, however, fail to reach\n\nthe female gametes. To compensate this loss of male gametes during\n\ntransport, the number of male gametes produced is several thousand\n\ntimes the number of female gametes produced.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n14\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nIn seed plants, pollen grains are the carriers of male\n\ngametes and  ovule have the egg. Pollen grains\n\nproduced in anthers therefore, have to be transferred\n\nto the stigma before it can lead to fertilisation (Figure\n\n1.7b). In bisexual, self-fertilising plants, e.g., peas,\n\ntransfer of pollen grains to the stigma is relatively easy\n\nas anthers and stigma are located close to each other;\n\npollen grains soon after they are shed, come in contact\n\nwith the stigma. But in cross pollinating plants\n\n(including dioecious plants), a specialised event called\n\npollination facilitates transfer of pollen grains to the\n\nstigma. Pollen grains germinate on the stigma and the\n\npollen tubes carrying the male gametes reach the ovule\n\nand discharge male gametes near the egg.  In dioecious\n\nanimals, since male and female gametes are formed in\n\ndifferent individuals, the organism must evolve a\n\nspecial mechanism for gamete transfer.  Successful\n\ntransfer and coming together of gametes is essential\n\nfor the most critical event in sexual reproduction, the\n\nfertilisation.\n\n1.2.2 Fertilisation\n\nThe most vital event of sexual reproduction is perhaps\n\nthe fusion of gametes. This process called syngamy\n\nresults in the formation of a diploid zygote. The term\n\nfertilisation is also often used for this process. The\n\nterms syngamy and fertilisation are frequently used\n\nthough , interchangeably.\n\nWhat would happen if syngamy does not occur?\n\nHowever, it has to be mentioned here that in some\n\norganisms like rotifers, honeybees and even some lizards\n\nand birds (turkey), the female gamete undergoes\n\ndevelopment to form new organisms without fertilisation. This\n\nphenomenon is called parthenogenesis.\n\nWhere does syngamy occur?  In most aquatic organisms, such  as a\n\nmajority of algae and fishes as well as amphibians, syngamy occurs in\n\nthe external medium (water), i.e., outside the body of the organism.  This\n\ntype of gametic fusion is called external fertilisation. Organisms\n\nexhibiting external fertilisation show great synchrony between the sexes\n\nand release a large number of gametes into the surrounding medium\n\n(water) in order to enhance the chances of syngamy.  This happens in the\n\nbony fishes and frogs where a large number of offspring are produced. A\n\nmajor disadvantage is that the offspring are extremely vulnerable to\n\npredators threatening their survival up to adulthood.\n\nFigure 1.7 (a) Homogametic contact in\nalga; (b) Germinating pollen\ngrains on the stigma of  a flower\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n15\n\nREPRODUCTION IN ORGANISMS\n\nIn many terrestrial organisms, belonging to fungi, higher animals such\n\nas reptiles, birds, mammals and in a majority of plants (bryophytes,\n\npteridophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms), syngamy occurs inside\n\nthe body of the organism, hence the process is called internal fertilisation.\n\nIn all these organisms, egg is formed inside the female body where they\n\nfuse with the male gamete. In organisms exhibiting internal fertilisation,\n\nthe male gamete is motile and has to reach the egg in order to fuse with it.\n\nIn these even though the number of sperms produced is very large, there\n\nis a significant reduction in the number of eggs produced. In seed plants,\n\nhowever, the non-motile male gametes are carried to female gamete by\n\npollen tubes.\n\n1.2.3 Post-fertilisation Events\n\nEvents in sexual reproduction after the formation of zygote are called\n\npost-fertilisation events.\n\n1.2.3.1 The Zygote\n\nFormation of the diploid zygote is universal in all sexually reproducing\n\norganisms. In organisms with external fertilisation, zygote is formed in\n\nthe external medium (usually water), whereas in those exhibiting internal\n\nfertilisation, zygote is formed inside the body of the organism.\n\n Further development of the zygote depends on the type of life cycle\n\nthe organism has and the environment it is exposed to. In organisms\n\nbelonging to fungi and algae, zygote develops a thick wall that is resistant\n\nto dessication and damage. It undergoes a period of rest before\n\ngermination.  In organisms with haplontic life cycle (As you have read\n\nin  Class XI), zygote divides by meiosis to form haploid spores that grow\n\ninto haploid individuals. Consult your Class XI book and find out what\n\nkind of development takes place in the zygote in organisms with diplontic\n\nand haplo-diplontic life cycles.\n\nZygote is the vital link that ensures continuity of species\n\nbetween organisms of one generation and the next. Every sexually\n\nreproducing organism, including human beings begin life as a single\n\ncell–the zygote.\n\n1.2.3.2 Embryogenesis\n\nEmbryogenesis refers to the process of development of embryo from the\n\nzygote.  During embryogenesis, zygote undergoes cell division (mitosis)\n\nand cell differentiation. While cell divisions increase the number of cells\n\nin the developing embryo; cell differentiation helps groups of cells to\n\nundergo certain modifications to form specialised tissues and organs to\n\nform an organism. You have studied about the process of cell division\n\nand differentiation in the previous class.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n16\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nAnimals are categorised into oviparous and viviparous based on\n\nwhether the development of the zygote takes place outside the body of\n\nthe female parent or inside, i.e., whether they lay fertilised/unfertilised\n\neggs or give birth to young ones.  In oviparous animals like reptiles and\n\nbirds, the fertilised eggs covered by hard calcareous shell are laid in a\n\nsafe place in the environment; after a period of incubation young ones\n\nhatch out. On the other hand, in viviparous animals (majority of mammals\n\nincluding human beings), the zygote develops into a young one inside\n\nthe body of the female organism. After attaining a certain stage of growth,\n\nthe young ones are delivered out of the body of the female organism.\n\nBecause of proper embryonic care and protection, the chances of survival\n\nof young ones is greater in viviparous organisms.\n\nIn flowering plants, the zygote is formed inside the ovule. After\n\nfertilisation the sepals, petals and stamens of the flower wither and fall\n\noff. Can you name a plant in which the sepals remain attached? The\n\npistil however, remains attached to the plant.  The zygote develops  into\n\nthe embryo and the ovules develop into the seed. The ovary develops into\n\nthe fruit which develops a thick wall called pericarp that is protective in\n\nfunction (Figure 1.8). After dispersal, seeds germinate under favourable\n\nconditions to produce new plants.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nReproduction enables a species to live generation after generation.\nReproduction in organisms can be broadly classified into asexual and\nsexual reproduction. Asexual reproduction does not involve the fusion\nof gametes. It is common in organisms that have a relatively simple\norganisation such as the fungi, algae and some invertebrate animals.\nThe offspring formed by asexual reproduction are identical and can be\nreferred to as clones. Zoospores, conidia, etc., are the most common\nasexual structures formed in several algae and fungi. Budding\nand gemmule formation are the common asexual methods seen in\nlower animals.\n\nProkaryotes and unicellular organisms reproduce asexually by\ncell division or binary fission of the parent cell. In several aquatic and\n\nFigure 1.8 A few kinds of fruit showing seeds (S) and\nprotective pericarp (P)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n17\n\nREPRODUCTION IN ORGANISMS\n\nterrestrial species of angiosperms, structures such as runners,\nrhizomes, suckers, tubers, offsets, etc., are capable of giving rise to\nnew offspring.  This method of asexual reproduction is generally\nreferred to as vegetative propagation.\n\nSexual reproduction involves the formation and fusion of gametes.\nIt is a complex and slower process as compared to asexual reproduction.\nMost of the higher animals reproduce almost entirely by sexual method.\nEvents of sexual reproduction may be categorised into pre-fertilisation,\nfertilisation and post-fertilisation events.  Pre-fertilisation events include\ngametogenesis and gamete transfer while post-fertilisation events\ninclude the formation of zygote and embryogenesis.\n\nOrganisms may be bisexual or unisexual.  Sexuality in plants is\nvaried, particularly in angiosperms, due to the production of diverse\ntypes of flowers.  Plants are defined as monoecious and dioecious.\nFlowers may be bisexual or unisexual flowers.\n\nGametes are haploid in nature and usually a direct product of meiotic\ndivision except in haploid organisms where gametes are formed by mitosis.\n\nTransfer of male gametes is an essential event in sexual reproduction.\nIt is relatively easy in bisexual organisms. In unisexual animals it occurs\nby copulation or simultaneous release. In angiosperms, a special process\ncalled pollination ensures transfer of pollen grains which carry the pollen\ngrains to the stigma.\n\nSyngamy (fertilisation) occurs between the male and female gametes.\nSyngamy may occur either externally, outside the body of organisms or\ninternally, inside the body. Syngamy leads to formation of a specialised\ncell called zygote.\n\n The process of development of embryo from the zygote is called\nembryogenesis.  In animals, the zygote starts developing soon after its\nformation. Animals may be either oviparous or viviparous.  Embryonal\nprotection and care are better in viviparous organisms.\n\n In flowering plants, after fertilisation, ovary develops into fruit and\novules mature into seeds. Inside the mature seed is the progenitor of\n\nthe next generation, the embryo.\n\nEXERCISES\n1. Why is reproduction essential for organisms?\n\n2.

The\n\nmyriads of flowers that we enjoy gazing at, the scents and\n\nthe perfumes that we swoon over, the rich colours that\n\nattract us, are all there as an aid to sexual reproduction.\n\nFlowers do not exist only for us to be used for our own\n\nselfishness. All flowering plants show sexual reproduction.\n\nA look at the diversity of structures of the inflorescences,\n\nflowers and floral parts, shows an amazing range of\n\nadaptations to ensure formation of the end products of\n\nsexual reproduction, the fruits and seeds.  In this chapter,\n\nlet us understand the morphology, structure and the\n\nprocesses of sexual reproduction in flowering plants\n\n(angiosperms).\n\n2.1 FLOWER – A FASCINATING ORGAN OF\nANGIOSPERMS\n\nHuman beings have had an intimate relationship with\n\nflowers since time immemorial.  Flowers are objects of\n\naesthetic, ornamental, social, religious and cultural value\n\n– they have always been used as symbols for conveying\n\nimportant human feelings such as love, affection,\n\nhappiness, grief, mourning, etc.  List at least five flowers\n\nof ornamental value that are commonly cultivated at\n\n2.1 Flower – A Fascinating\n\nOrgan of Angiosperms\n\n2.2 Pre-fertilisation : Structures\n\nand Events\n\n2.3 Double Fertilisation\n\n2.4 Post-fertilisation: Structures\n\nand Events\n\n2.5 Apomixis and\n\nPolyembryony\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nSEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN\n\nFLOWERING PLANTS\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n20\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nhomes and in gardens. Find out the names of five more flowers that are\n\nused in social and cultural celebrations in your family.  Have you heard\n\nof floriculture – what does it refer to?\n\nTo a biologist, flowers are morphological and embryological marvels\n\nand the sites of sexual reproduction.  In class XI, you have read the various\n\nparts of a flower.  Figure 2.1 will help you recall the parts of a typical\n\nflower. Can you name the two parts in a flower in which the two most\n\nimportant units of sexual reproduction develop?\n\n2.2 PRE-FERTILISATION: STRUCTURES AND EVENTS\n\nMuch before the actual flower is seen on a plant, the decision that the plant\n\nis going to flower has taken place. Several hormonal and structural changes\n\nare initiated which lead to the differentiation and further development of\n\nthe floral primordium. Inflorescences are formed which bear the floral buds\n\nand then the flowers. In the flower the male and female reproductive\n\nstructures, the androecium and the gynoecium differentiate and develop.\n\nYou would recollect that the androecium consists of a whorl of stamens\n\nrepresenting the male reproductive organ and the gynoecium represents\n\nthe female reproductive organ.\n\nFigure 2.1 A diagrammatic representation of L.S. of a flower\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n21\n\nHUMAN REPRODUCTIONSEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN FLOWERING PLANTS\n\n2.2.1 Stamen, Microsporangium and Pollen Grain\n\nFigure 2.2a shows the two parts of a typical stamen – the long and slender\n\nstalk called the filament, and the terminal generally bilobed structure\n\ncalled the anther. The proximal end of the filament\n\nis attached to the thalamus or the petal of the flower.\n\nThe number and length of stamens are variable in\n\nflowers of different species.  If you were to collect a\n\nstamen each from ten flowers (each from different\n\nspecies) and arrange them on a slide, you would\n\nbe able to appreciate the large variation in size seen\n\nin nature.  Careful observation of each stamen\n\nunder a dissecting microscope and making neat\n\ndiagrams would elucidate the range in shape and\n\nattachment of anthers in different flowers.\n\nA typical angiosperm anther is bilobed with\n\neach lobe having two theca, i.e., they are dithecous\n\n(Figure 2.2 b). Often a longitudinal groove runs\n\nlengthwise separating the theca. Let us\n\nunderstand the various types of tissues and their\n\norganisation in the transverse section of an anther\n\n(Figure 2.3 a). The bilobed nature of an anther is\n\nvery distinct in the transverse section of the anther.\n\nThe anther is a four-sided (tetragonal) structure\n\nconsisting of four microsporangia located at the\n\ncorners, two in each lobe.\n\nThe microsporangia develop further and\n\nbecome pollen sacs.  They extend longitudinally\n\nall through the length of an anther and are packed\n\nwith pollen grains.\n\nStructure of microsporangium: In a transverse\n\nsection, a typical microsporangium appears near\n\ncircular in outline.  It is generally surrounded by four wall layers (Figure\n\n2.3 b)– the epidermis, endothecium, middle layers and the tapetum. The\n\nouter three wall layers perform the function of protection and help in\n\ndehiscence of anther to release the pollen.  The innermost wall layer is\n\nthe tapetum.  It nourishes the developing pollen grains. Cells of the\n\ntapetum possess dense cytoplasm and generally have more than one\n\nnucleus.  Can you think of how tapetal cells could become bi-nucleate?\n\nWhen the anther is young, a group of compactly arranged homogenous\n\ncells called the sporogenous tissue occupies the centre of each\n\nmicrosporangium.\n\nMicrosporogenesis : As the anther develops, the cells of the sporogenous\n\ntissue undergo meiotic divisions to form microspore tetrads.  What would\n\nbe the ploidy of the cells of the tetrad?\n\nFigure 2.2 (a) A typical stamen;\n(b) three–dimensional cut section\n of an anther\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n22\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nAs each cell of the sporogenous tissue is capable of giving rise to a\n\nmicrospore tetrad. Each one is a potential pollen or microspore mother\n\ncell. The process of formation of microspores from a pollen mother cell (PMC)\n\nthrough meiosis is called microsporogenesis. The microspores, as they\n\nare formed, are arranged in a cluster of four cells–the microspore tetrad\n\n(Figure 2.3 a).  As the anthers mature and dehydrate, the microspores\n\ndissociate from each other and develop into pollen grains (Figure 2.3 b).\n\nInside each microsporangium several thousands of microspores or pollen\n\ngrains are formed that are released with the dehiscence of anther\n\n(Figure 2.3 c).\n\nPollen grain: The pollen grains represent the male gametophytes.  If you\n\ntouch the opened anthers of Hibiscus or any other flower you would find\n\ndeposition of yellowish powdery pollen grains on your fingers. Sprinkle\n\nthese grains on a drop of water taken on a glass slide and observe under\n\n(c)\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 2.3 (a) Transverse section of a young anther; (b) Enlarged view of one microsporangium\nshowing wall layers; (c) A mature dehisced anther\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n23\n\nHUMAN REPRODUCTIONSEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN FLOWERING PLANTS\n\na microscope.  You will really be amazed at the variety of architecture –\n\nsizes, shapes, colours, designs – seen on the pollen grains\n\nfrom different species (Figure 2.4).\n\nPollen grains are generally spherical measuring about\n\n25-50 micrometers in diameter. It has a prominent two-layered\n\nwall.  The hard outer layer called the exine is made up of\n\nsporopollenin which is one of the most resistant organic material\n\nknown. It can withstand high temperatures and strong acids\n\nand alkali. No enzyme that degrades sporopollenin is so far\n\nknown. Pollen grain exine has prominent apertures called germ\n\npores where sporopollenin is absent.  Pollen grains are well-\n\npreserved as fossils because of the presence of sporopollenin.\n\nThe exine exhibits a fascinating array of patterns and designs.\n\nWhy do you think the exine should be hard?  What is the\n\nfunction of germ pore?  The inner wall of the pollen grain is\n\ncalled the intine.  It is a thin and continuous layer made up of\n\ncellulose and pectin.  The cytoplasm of pollen grain is\n\nsurrounded by a plasma membrane.  When the pollen grain is\n\nmature it contains two cells, the vegetative cell and generative\n\ncell (Figure 2.5b).  The vegetative cell is bigger, has abundant\n\nfood reserve and a large irregularly shaped nucleus. The\n\ngenerative cell is small and floats in the cytoplasm of the\n\nvegetative cell.  It is spindle shaped with dense cytoplasm and\n\na nucleus.  In over 60 per cent of angiosperms, pollen grains\n\nare shed at this 2-celled stage. In the remaining species, the\n\ngenerative cell divides mitotically to give rise to the two male\n\ngametes before pollen grains are shed (3-celled stage).\n\nPollen grains of many species cause severe allergies and bronchial\n\nafflictions in some people often leading to chronic respiratory\n\ndisorders– asthma, bronchitis, etc. It may be mentioned that Parthenium\n\nor carrot grass that came into India as a contaminant with imported wheat,\n\nhas become ubiquitous in occurrence and causes pollen allergy.\n\nFigure 2.5 (a) Enlarged view of\na pollen grain tetrad; (b) stages\nof a microspore maturing into a\npollen grain\n\nFigure 2.4 Scanning electron micrographs of a few pollen grains\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n24\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nWhen once they are shed, pollen grains have to land on the stigma\n\nbefore they lose viability if they have to bring about fertilisation. How long\n\ndo you think the pollen grains retain viability? The period for which pollen\n\ngrains remain viable is highly variable and to some extent depends on the\n\nprevailing temperature and humidity. In some cereals such as rice and\n\nwheat, pollen grains lose viability within 30 minutes of their release, and\n\nin some members of Rosaceae, Leguminoseae and Solanaceae, they\n\nmaintain viability for months. You may have heard of storing semen/\n\nsperms of many animals including humans for artificial insemination. It\n\nis possible to store pollen grains of a large number of species for years in\n\nliquid nitrogen (-1960C). Such stored pollen can be used as pollen banks,\n\nsimilar to seed banks, in crop breeding programmes.\n\n2.2.2 The Pistil, Megasporangium (ovule) and Embryo sac\n\nThe gynoecium represents the female reproductive part of the flower.  The\n\ngynoecium may consist of a single pistil (monocarpellary) or may have\n\nmore than one pistil (multicarpellary).  When there are more than one,\n\nthe pistils may be fused together (syncarpous) (Figure 2.7b) or may be\n\nfree (apocarpous) (Figure 2.7c). Each pistil has three parts (Figure 2.7a),\n\nthe stigma, style and ovary. The stigma serves as a landing platform\n\nfor pollen grains.  The style is the elongated slender part beneath the\n\nstigma.  The basal bulged part of the pistil is the ovary.  Inside the ovary\n\nis the ovarian cavity ( ( ( ( (locule).  The placenta is located inside the ovarian\ncavity.  Recall the definition and types of placentation that you studied in\n\nFigure 2.6 Pollen products\n\nPollen grains are rich in nutrients. It has become a fashion in recent\n\nyears to use pollen tablets as food supplements. In western countries, a\n\nlarge number of  pollen products in the form of tablets and syrups are\n\navailable in the market. Pollen consumption has been claimed to increase\n\nthe performance of athletes and race horses (Figure 2.6).\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n25\n\nHUMAN REPRODUCTIONSEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN FLOWERING PLANTS\n\nClass XI.  Arising from the placenta are the megasporangia, commonly\n\ncalled ovules.  The number of ovules in an ovary may be one (wheat,\n\npaddy, mango) to many (papaya, water melon, orchids).\n\nThe Megasporangium (Ovule) : Let us familiarise ourselves with the\n\nstructure of a typical angiosperm ovule (Figure 2.7d). The ovule is a small\n\nstructure attached to the placenta by means of a stalk called funicle.\n\nThe body of the ovule fuses with funicle in the region called hilum. Thus,\n\nhilum represents the junction between ovule and funicle. Each ovule has\n\none or two protective envelopes called integuments. Integuments encircle\n\nthe nucellus except at the tip where a small opening called the micropyle\n\nis organised. Opposite the micropylar end, is the chalaza, representing\n\nthe basal part of the ovule.\n\nEnclosed within the integuments is a mass of cells called the nucellus.\n\nCells of the nucellus have abundant reserve food materials.  Located in the\n\nnucellus is the embryo sac or female gametophyte. An ovule generally has\n\na single embryo sac formed from a megaspore.\n\nMegasporogenesis : The process of formation of megaspores from the\n\nmegaspore mother cell is called megasporogenesis. Ovules generally\n\ndifferentiate a single megaspore mother cell (MMC) in the micropylar region\n\nStigma\n\nStyle\n\nOvary\n\nThalamus\n\nFigure 2.7 (a) A dissected flower of Hibiscus showing pistil (other floral parts have been removed);\n(b) Multicarpellary, syncarpous pistil of Papaver ; (c) A multicarpellary, apocarpous\ngynoecium of Michelia; (d) A diagrammatic view of a typical anatropous ovule\n\n(a) (b) (c) (d)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n26\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nFigure 2.8 (a) Parts of the ovule showing a large megaspore mother cell, a dyad and a tetrad of\nmegaspores; (b) 2, 4, and 8-nucleate stages of embryo sac and a mature embryo sac; (c) A\ndiagrammatic representation of the mature embryo sac.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nof the nucellus. It is a large cell containing dense cytoplasm and a\n\nprominent nucleus. The MMC undergoes meiotic division. What is the\n\nimportance of the MMC undergoing meiosis? Meiosis results in the\n\nproduction of four megaspores (Figure 2.8a).\n\nFemale gametophyte : In a majority of flowering plants, one of the\n\nmegaspores is functional while the other three degenerate. Only the\n\nfunctional megaspore develops into the female gametophyte (embryo\n\nsac). This method of embryo sac formation from a single megaspore is termed\n\nmonosporic development. What will be the ploidy of the cells of the nucellus,\n\nMMC, the functional megaspore and female gametophyte?\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n27\n\nHUMAN REPRODUCTIONSEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN FLOWERING PLANTS\n\nLet us study formation of the embryo sac in a little more detail.\n\n(Figure 2.8b). The nucleus of the functional megaspore divides mitotically\n\nto form two nuclei which move to the opposite poles, forming the\n\n2-nucleate embryo sac. Two more sequential mitotic nuclear divisions\n\nresult in the formation of the 4-nucleate and later the 8-nucleate stages\n\nof the embryo sac. It is of interest to note that these mitotic divisions are\n\nstrictly free nuclear, that is, nuclear divisions are not followed immediately\n\nby cell wall formation. After the 8-nucleate stage, cell walls are laid down\n\nleading to the organisation of the typical female gametophyte\n\nor embryo sac. Observe the distribution of cells inside the embryo sac\n\n(Figure 2.8b, c).  Six of the eight nuclei are surrounded by cell walls and\n\norganised into cells; the remaining two nuclei, called polar nuclei are\n\nsituated below the egg apparatus in the large central cell.\n\nThere is a characteristic distribution of the cells within the embryo\n\nsac. Three cells are grouped together at the micropylar end and constitute\n\nthe egg apparatus.  The egg apparatus, in turn, consists of two synergids\n\nand one egg cell. The synergids have special cellular thickenings at the\n\nmicropylar tip called filiform apparatus, which play an important role in\n\nguiding the pollen tubes into the synergid. Three cells are at the chalazal\n\nend and are called the antipodals. The large central cell, as mentioned\n\nearlier, has two polar nuclei. Thus, a typical angiosperm embryo sac, at\n\nmaturity, though 8-nucleate is 7-celled.\n\n2.2.3 Pollination\n\nIn the preceding sections you have learnt that the male and female gametes\n\nin flowering plants are produced in the pollen grain and embryo sac,\n\nrespectively. As both types of gametes are non-motile, they have to be\n\nbrought together for fertilisation to occur. How is this achieved?\n\nPollination is the mechanism to achieve this objective. Transfer\n\nof pollen grains (shed from the anther) to the stigma of a pistil is\n\ntermed pollination. Flowering plants have evolved an amazing array\n\nof adaptations to achieve pollination. They make use of  external\n\nagents to achieve pollination. Can you list the possible external\n\nagents?\n\nKinds of Pollination : Depending on the source of pollen, pollination\n\ncan be divided into three types.\n\n(i) Autogamy : In this type, pollination is achieved within the same\n\nflower. Transfer of pollen grains from the anther to the stigma of the\n\nsame flower (Figure 2.9a). In a normal flower which opens and\n\nexposes the anthers and the stigma, complete autogamy is rather\n\nrare. Autogamy in such flowers requires synchrony in pollen release\n\nand stigma receptivity and also, the anthers and the stigma should\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n28\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nlie close to each other so that self-pollination\n\ncan occur. Some plants such as Viola\n\n(common pansy), Oxalis, and Commelina\n\nproduce two types of flowers –\n\nchasmogamous flowers which are similar to\n\nflowers of other species with exposed anthers\n\nand stigma, and cleistogamous flowers which\n\ndo not open at all (Figure 2.9c). In such flowers,\n\nthe anthers and stigma lie close to each other.\n\nWhen anthers dehisce in the flower buds,\n\npollen grains come in contact with the stigma\n\nto effect pollination. Thus, cleistogamous\n\nflowers are invariably autogamous as there is\n\nno chance of cross-pollen landing on the\n\nstigma. Cleistogamous flowers produce\n\nassured seed-set even in the absence of\n\npollinators. Do you think that cleistogamy is\n\nadvantageous or disadvantageous to the\n\nplant? Why?\n\n(ii) Geitonogamy – Transfer of pollen grains from\n\nthe anther to the stigma of another flower of\n\nthe same plant. Although geitonogamy is\n\nfunctionally cross-pollination involving a\n\npollinating agent, genetically it is similar to\n\nautogamy since the pollen grains come from\n\nthe same plant.\n\n(iii) Xenogamy – Transfer of pollen grains from\n\nanther to the stigma of a different plant (Figure\n\n2.9b). This is the only type of pollination which\n\nduring pollination brings genetically different\n\ntypes of pollen grains to the stigma.\n\nAgents of Pollination : Plants use two abiotic (wind\n\nand water) and one biotic (animals) agents to achieve\n\npollination. Majority of plants use biotic agents for\n\npollination. Only a small proportion of plants use\n\nabiotic agents. Pollen grains coming in contact with\n\nthe stigma is a chance factor in both wind and water\n\npollination. To compensate for this uncertainties and\n\nassociated loss of pollen grains, the flowers produce\n\nenormous amount of pollen when compared to the\n\nnumber of ovules available for pollination.\n\nFigure 2.9 (a) Self-pollinated flowers;\n(b) Cross pollinated flowers;\n(c) Cleistogamous flowers\n\n(a)\n\n(c)\n\n(b)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n29\n\nHUMAN REPRODUCTIONSEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN FLOWERING PLANTS\n\nPollination by wind is more common\n\namongst abiotic pollinations. Wind pollination\n\nalso requires that the pollen grains are light\n\nand non-sticky so that they can be\n\ntransported in wind currents. They often\n\npossess well-exposed stamens (so that the\n\npollens are easily dispersed into wind currents,\n\nFigure 2.10) and large often-feathery stigma\n\nto easily trap air-borne pollen grains. Wind-\n\npollinated flowers often have a single ovule in\n\neach ovary and numerous flowers packed into\n\nan inflorescence; a familiar example is the corn\n\ncob – the tassels you see are nothing but the\n\nstigma and style which wave in the wind to\n\ntrap pollen grains.  Wind-pollination is quite\n\ncommon in grasses.\n\nPollination by water is quite rare in\n\nflowering plants and is limited to about 30\n\ngenera, mostly monocotyledons. As against\n\nthis, you would recall that water is a regular\n\nmode of transport for the male gametes among\n\nthe lower plant groups such as algae,\n\nbryophytes and pteridophytes. It is believed,\n\nparticularly for some bryophytes and\n\npteridophytes, that their distribution is limited\n\nbecause of the need for water for the transport\n\nof male gametes and fertilisation. Some\n\nexamples of water pollinated plants are  Vallisneria and Hydrilla which\n\ngrow  in  fresh water and several marine sea-grasses such as Zostera. Not\n\nall aquatic plants use water for pollination. In a majority of aquatic plants\n\nsuch as water hyacinth and water lily, the flowers emerge above the level\n\nof water and are pollinated by insects or wind as in most of the land\n\nplants. In Vallisneria, the female flower reach the surface of water by the\n\nlong stalk and the male flowers or pollen grains are released on to the\n\nsurface of water. They are carried passively by water currents (Figure\n\n2.11a);  some of them eventually reach the female flowers and the stigma.\n\nIn another group of water pollinated plants such as seagrasses, female\n\nflowers remain submerged in water and the pollen grains are released\n\ninside the water. Pollen grains in many such species are long, ribbon like\n\nand they are carried passively inside the water; some of them reach the\n\nstigma and achieve pollination. In most of the water-pollinated species,\n\npollen grains are protected from wetting by a mucilaginous covering.\n\nBoth wind and water pollinated flowers are not very colourful and do\n\nnot produce nectar. What would be the reason for this?\n\nFigure 2.10 A wind-pollinated plant showing\ncompact inflorecence and well-\nexposed stamens\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n30\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nMajority of flowering plants use\n\na range of animals as pollinating\n\nagents. Bees, butterflies, flies,\n\nbeetles, wasps, ants, moths, birds\n\n(sunbirds and humming birds)  and\n\nbats are the common pollinating\n\nagents. (Figure 2.11b). Among the\n\nanimals, insects, particularly bees\n\nare the dominant biotic pollinating\n\nagents.  Even larger animals such\n\nas some primates (lemurs), arboreal\n\n(tree-dwelling) rodents, or even\n\nreptiles (gecko lizard and garden\n\nlizard) have also been reported as\n\npollinators in some species.\n\nOften flowers of animal-\n\npollinated plants are specifically\n\nadapted for a particular species of\n\nanimal.\n\nMajority of insect-pollinated\n\nflowers are large, colourful, fragrant\n\nand rich in nectar. When the flowers\n\nare small, a number of flowers are\n\nclustered into an inflorescence to\n\nmake them conspicuous. Animals\n\nare attracted to flowers by colour\n\nand/or fragrance. The flowers\n\npollinated by flies and beetles\n\nsecrete foul odours to attract these\n\nanimals. To sustain animal visits,\n\nthe flowers have to provide rewards\n\nto the animals. Nectar and pollen\n\ngrains are the usual floral rewards.\n\nFor harvesting the reward(s) from\n\nthe flower the animal visitor comes\n\nin contact with the anthers and the\n\nstigma. The body of the animal gets\n\na coating of pollen grains, which are\n\ngenerally sticky in animal pollinated flowers. When the animal carrying\n\npollen on its body comes in contact with the stigma, it brings about\n\npollination.\n\nIn some species floral rewards are in providing safe places to lay eggs;\n\nan example is that of the tallest flower of Amorphophallus (the flower\n\nitself is about 6 feet in height). A similar relationship exists between a\n\nspecies of moth and the plant Yucca where both species – moth and the\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 2.11 (a) Pollination by water in Vallisneria ;\n(b) Insect pollination\n\n\n\n31\n\nHUMAN REPRODUCTIONSEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN FLOWERING PLANTS\n\nplant – cannot complete their life cycles without each other. The moth\n\ndeposits its eggs in the locule of the ovary and the flower, in turn, gets\n\npollinated by the moth.  The larvae of the moth come out of the eggs as\n\nthe seeds start developing.\n\nWhy don’t you observe some flowers of the following plants (or any\n\nothers available to you): Cucumber, Mango, Peepal, Coriander, Papaya,\n\nOnion, Lobia, Cotton, Tobacco, Rose, Lemon, Eucalyptus, Banana? Try to\n\nfind out which animals visit them and whether they could be\n\npollinators.You’ll have to patiently observe the flowers over a few days\n\nand at different times of the day.  You could also try to see whether there\n\nis any correlation in the characteristics of a flower to the animal that\n\nvisits it. Carefully observe if any of the visitors come in contact with the\n\nanthers and the stigma as only such visitors can bring about pollination.\n\nMany insects may consume pollen or the nectar without bringing about\n\npollination. Such floral visitors are referred to as pollen/nectar robbers.\n\nYou may or may not be able to identify the pollinators, but you will surely\n\nenjoy your efforts!\n\nOutbreeding Devices : Majority of flowering plants produce hermaphrodite\n\nflowers and pollen grains are likely to come in contact with the stigma of\n\nthe same flower. Continued self-pollination result in inbreeding depression.\n\nFlowering plants have developed many devices to discourage self-\n\npollination and to encourage cross-pollination. In some species, pollen\n\nrelease and stigma receptivity are not synchronised. Either the pollen is\n\nreleased before the stigma becomes receptive or stigma becomes receptive\n\nmuch before the release of pollen. In some other species, the anther and\n\nstigma are placed at different positions so that the pollen cannot come in\n\ncontact with the stigma of the same flower. Both these devices prevent\n\nautogamy. The third device to prevent inbreeding is self-incompatibility.\n\nThis is a genetic mechanism and prevents self-pollen (from the same flower\n\nor other flowers of the same plant) from fertilising the ovules by inhibiting\n\npollen germination or pollen tube growth in the pistil.  Another device to\n\nprevent self-pollination is the production of unisexual flowers. If both male\n\nand female flowers are present on the same plant such as castor and maize\n\n(monoecious), it prevents autogamy but not geitonogamy. In several species\n\nsuch as papaya, male and female flowers are present on different plants,\n\nthat is each plant is either male or female (dioecy). This condition prevents\n\nboth autogamy and geitonogamy.\n\nPollen-pistil Interaction : Pollination does not guarantee the transfer\n\nof the right type of pollen (compatible pollen of the same species as the\n\nstigma). Often, pollen of the wrong type, either from other species or from\n\nthe same plant (if it is self-incompatible), also land on the stigma. The\n\npistil has the ability to recognise the pollen, whether it is of the right type\n\n(compatible) or of the wrong type (incompatible). If it is of the right type,\n\nthe pistil accepts the pollen and promotes post-pollination events that\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n32\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nleads to fertilisation. If the pollen is of the wrong type, the pistil rejects the\n\npollen by preventing pollen germination on the stigma or the pollen tube\n\ngrowth in the style. The ability of the pistil to recognise the pollen followed\n\nby its acceptance or rejection is the result of a continuous dialogue\n\nbetween pollen grain and the pistil. This dialogue is mediated by chemical\n\ncomponents of the pollen interacting with those of the pistil. It is only in\n\nrecent years that botanists have been able to identify some of the pollen\n\nand pistil components and the interactions leading to the recognition,\n\nfollowed by acceptance or rejection.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, following compatible pollination, the pollen grain\n\ngerminates on the stigma to produce a pollen tube through one of the\n\ngerm pores (Figure 2.12a). The contents of the pollen grain move into the\n\nFigure 2.12 (a) Pollen grains germinating on the stigma; (b) Pollen tubes growing through the\nstyle; (c) L.S. of pistil showing path of pollen tube growth; (d) enlarged view of an\negg apparatus showing entry of pollen tube into a synergid; (e) Discharge of male\ngametes into a synergid and the movements of the sperms, one into the egg and\nthe other into the central cell\n\n(e)\n(d)\n\n(a) (b) (c)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n33\n\nHUMAN REPRODUCTIONSEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN FLOWERING PLANTS\n\npollen tube. Pollen tube grows through the tissues of the stigma and\n\nstyle and reaches the ovary (Figure 2.12b, c). You would recall that in\n\nsome plants, pollen grains are shed at two-celled condition (a vegetative\n\ncell and a generative cell).  In such plants, the generative cell divides and\n\nforms the two male gametes during the growth of pollen tube in the stigma.\n\nIn plants which shed pollen in the three-celled condition, pollen tubes\n\ncarry the two male gametes from the beginning. Pollen tube, after reaching\n\nthe ovary, enters the ovule through the micropyle and then enters one of\n\nthe synergids through the filiform apparatus (Figure 2.12d, e). Many recent\n\nstudies have shown that filiform apparatus present at the micropylar part\n\nof the synergids guides the entry of pollen tube.  All these events–from\n\npollen deposition on the stigma until pollen tubes enter the ovule–are\n\ntogether referred to as pollen-pistil interaction. As pointed out earlier,\n\npollen-pistil interaction is a dynamic process involving pollen recognition\n\nfollowed by promotion or inhibition of the pollen. The knowledge gained\n\nin this area would help the plant breeder in manipulating pollen-pistil\n\ninteraction, even in incompatible pollinations, to get desired hybrids.\n\nYou can easily study pollen germination by dusting some pollen from\n\nflowers such as  pea, chickpea, Crotalaria, balsam and Vinca on a glass slide\n\ncontaining a drop of sugar solution (about 10 per cent). After about 15–30\n\nminutes, observe the slide under the low power lens of the microscope.  You\n\nare likely to see pollen tubes coming out of the pollen grains.\n\nAs you shall learn in the chapter on plant breeding (Chapter 9), a\n\nbreeder is interested in crossing different species and often genera to\n\ncombine desirable characters to produce commercially ‘superior’ varieties.\n\nArtificial hybridisation is one of the major approaches of crop\n\nimprovement programme. In such crossing experiments it is important\n\nto make sure that only the desired pollen grains are used for pollination\n\nand the stigma is protected from contamination (from unwanted pollen).\n\nThis is achieved by emasculation and bagging techniques.\n\nIf the female parent bears bisexual flowers, removal of anthers from\n\nthe flower bud before the anther dehisces using a pair of forceps is\n\nnecessary. This step is referred to as emasculation. Emasculated flowers\n\nhave to be covered with a bag of suitable size, generally made up of butter\n\npaper, to prevent contamination of its stigma with unwanted pollen. This\n\nprocess is called bagging. When the stigma of bagged flower attains\n\nreceptivity, mature pollen grains collected from anthers of the male parent\n\nare dusted on the stigma, and the flowers are rebagged, and the fruits\n\nallowed to develop.\n\nIf the female parent produces unisexual flowers, there is no need for\n\nemasculation. The female flower buds are bagged before the flowers open.\n\nWhen the stigma becomes receptive, pollination is carried out using the\n\ndesired pollen and the flower rebagged.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n34\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n2.4  POST-FERTILISATION : STRUCTURES AND EVENTS\n\nFollowing double fertilisation, events of  endosperm and embryo\n\ndevelopment, maturation of ovule(s) into seed(s) and ovary into fruit, are\n\ncollectively termed post-fertilisation events.\n\n2.4.1 Endosperm\n\nEndosperm development precedes embryo development. Why? The\n\nprimary endosperm cell divides repeatedly and forms a triploid\n\nFigure 2.13 (a) Fertilised embryo sac showing zygote and Primary Endosperm Nucleus (PEN);\n(b) Stages in embryo development in a dicot [shown in reduced size as compared to (a)]\n\n(a) (b)\n\n2.3 DOUBLE FERTILISATION\n\nAfter entering one of the synergids, the pollen tube releases the two male\n\ngametes into the cytoplasm of the synergid.  One of the male gametes\n\nmoves towards the egg cell and fuses with its nucleus thus completing the\n\nsyngamy.  This results in the formation of a diploid cell, the zygote. The\n\nother male gamete moves towards the two polar nuclei located in the central\n\ncell and fuses with them to produce a triploid primary endosperm nucleus\n\n(PEN) (Figure 2.13a).  As this involves the fusion of three haploid nuclei it\n\nis termed triple fusion. Since two types of fusions, syngamy and triple\n\nfusion take place in an embryo sac the phenomenon is termed double\n\nfertilisation, an event unique to flowering plants. The central cell after\n\ntriple fusion becomes the primary endosperm cell (PEC) and develops\n\ninto the endosperm while the zygote develops into an embryo.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n35\n\nHUMAN REPRODUCTIONSEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN FLOWERING PLANTS\n\nendosperm tissue. The cells of this tissue are filled with\n\nreserve food materials and are used for the nutrition of\n\nthe developing embryo. In the most common type of\n\nendosperm development, the PEN undergoes successive\n\nnuclear divisions to give rise to free nuclei. This stage of\n\nendosperm development is called free-nuclear endosperm.\n\nSubsequently cell  wall formation occurs and the\n\nendosperm becomes cellular. The number of free nuclei\n\nformed before cellularisation varies greatly. The coconut\n\nwater from tender coconut that you are familiar with, is\n\nnothing but free-nuclear endosperm (made up of\n\nthousands of nuclei) and the surrounding white kernel is\n\nthe cellular endosperm.\n\nEndosperm may either be completely consumed by the\n\ndeveloping embryo (e.g., pea, groundnut, beans) before seed\n\nmaturation or it may persist in the mature seed (e.g. castor\n\nand coconut) and be used up during seed germination. Split\n\nopen some seeds of castor, peas, beans, groundnut, fruit of\n\ncoconut and look for the endosperm in each case.  Find out\n\nwhether the endosperm is persistent in cereals – wheat, rice\n\nand maize.\n\n2.4.2 Embryo\n\nEmbryo develops at the micropylar end of the embryo sac where\n\nthe zygote is situated. Most zygotes divide only after certain\n\namount of endosperm is formed. This is an adaptation to\n\nprovide assured nutrition to the developing embryo. Though\n\nthe seeds differ greatly, the early stages of embryo development\n\n(embryogeny) are similar in both monocotyledons and\n\ndicotyledons. Figure 2.13 depicts the stages of embryogeny in\n\na dicotyledonous embryo.  The zygote gives rise to the\n\nproembryo and subsequently to the globular, heart-shaped\n\nand mature embryo.\n\nA typical dicotyledonous embryo (Figure 2.14a), consists\n\nof an embryonal axis and two cotyledons. The portion of\n\nembryonal axis above the level of cotyledons is the epicotyl,\n\nwhich terminates with the plumule or stem tip. The cylindrical\n\nportion below the level of cotyledons is hypocotyl that\n\nterminates at its lower end in the radicle or root tip.  The root\n\ntip is covered with a root cap.\n\nEmbryos of monocotyledons (Figure 2.14 b) possess only\n\none cotyledon. In the grass family the cotyledon is called\n\nscutellum that is situated towards one side (lateral) of the\n\nembryonal axis. At its lower end, the embryonal axis has the\n\nFigure 2.14 (a) A typical dicot\nembryo; (b)  L.S. of an\nembryo of grass\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n36\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nradical and root cap enclosed in an undifferentiated sheath called\n\ncoleorrhiza. The portion of the embryonal axis above the level of\n\nattachment of scutellum is the epicotyl. Epicotyl has a shoot apex and a\n\nfew leaf primordia enclosed in a hollow foliar structure, the coleoptile.\n\nSoak a few seeds in water (say of wheat, maize, peas, chickpeas,\n\nground nut) overnight.  Then split the seeds and observe the various\n\nparts of the embryo and the seed.\n\n2.4.3 Seed\n\nIn angiosperms, the seed is the final product of sexual reproduction.  It is\n\noften described as a fertilised ovule. Seeds are formed inside fruits. A\n\nseed typically consists of seed coat(s), cotyledon(s) and an embryo axis.\n\nThe cotyledons (Figure 2.15a) of the embryo are simple structures,\n\ngenerally thick and swollen due to storage of food reserves (as in legumes).\n\nMature seeds may be non-albuminous or ex-albuminous. Non-\n\nalbuminous seeds have no residual endosperm as it is completely\n\nconsumed during embryo development (e.g., pea, groundnut).\n\nAlbuminous seeds retain a part of endosperm as it is not completely used\n\nup during embryo development (e.g., wheat, maize, barley, castor).\n\nOccasionally, in some seeds such as black pepper and beet, remnants of\n\nnucellus are also persistent.  This residual, persistent nucellus is the\n\nperisperm.\n\nInteguments of ovules harden as tough protective seed coats\n\n(Figure 2.15a). The micropyle remains as a small pore in the seed coat.\n\nThis facilitates entry of oxygen and water into the seed during germination.\n\nAs the seed matures, its water content is reduced and seeds become\n\nrelatively dry (10-15 per cent moisture by mass). The general metabolic\n\nactivity of the embryo slows down.  The embryo may  enter a state of\n\ninactivity called dormancy, or if favourable conditions are available\n\n(adequate moisture, oxygen and suitable temperature), they germinate.\n\nAs ovules mature into seeds, the ovary develops into a fruit, i.e., the\n\ntransformation of ovules into seeds and ovary into fruit proceeds\n\nsimultaneously.  The wall of the ovary develops into the wall of fruit called\n\npericarp.  The fruits may be fleshy as in guava, orange, mango, etc., or\n\nmay be dry, as in groundnut, and  mustard, etc.  Many fruits have evolved\n\nmechanisms for dispersal of seeds.  Recall the classification of fruits and\n\ntheir dispersal mechanisms that you have studied in an earlier class. Is\n\nthere any relationship between number of ovules in an ovary and the\n\nnumber of seeds present in a fruit?\n\nIn most plants, by the time the fruit develops from the ovary, other\n\nfloral parts degenerate and fall off. However, in a few species such as apple,\n\nstrawberry, cashew, etc., the thalamus  also contributes to fruit formation.\n\nSuch fruits are called false fruits (Figure 2.15b).  Most fruits however\n\ndevelop only from the ovary and are called true fruits. Although in most\n\nof the species, fruits are the results of fertilisation, there are a few species\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n37\n\nHUMAN REPRODUCTIONSEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN FLOWERING PLANTS\n\nin which fruits develop without fertilisation. Such fruits are called\n\nparthenocarpic fruits. Banana is one such example. Parthenocarpy can\n\nbe induced through the application of growth hormones and such fruits\n\nare seedless.\n\nSeeds offer several advantages to angiosperms. Firstly, since\n\nreproductive processes such as pollination and fertilisation are\n\nindependent of water, seed formation is more dependable. Also seeds have\n\nbetter adaptive strategies for dispersal to new habitats and help the species\n\nFigure 2.15 (a) Structure of some seeds. (b) False fruits of apple and strawberry\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n38\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nto colonise in other areas. As they have  sufficient food reserves, young\n\nseedlings are nourished until they are capable of photosynthesis on their\n\nown. The hard seed coat provides protection to the young embryo. Being\n\nproducts of sexual reproduction, they generate new genetic combinations\n\nleading to variations.\n\nSeed is the basis of our agriculture. Dehydration and dormancy of\n\nmature seeds are crucial for storage of seeds which can be used as food\n\nthroughout the year and also to raise crop in the next season. Can you\n\nimagine agriculture in the absence of seeds, or in the presence of seeds\n\nwhich germinate straight away soon after formation and cannot be stored?\n\nHow long do the seeds remain alive after they are dispersed? This\n\nperiod again varies greatly. In a few species the seeds lose viability within\n\na few months. Seeds of a large number of species live for several years.\n\nSome seeds can remain alive for hundreds of years. There are several\n\nrecords of very old yet viable seeds. The oldest is that of a lupine, Lupinus\n\narcticus excavated from Arctic Tundra. The seed germinated and flowered\n\nafter an estimated record of 10,000 years of dormancy. A recent record of\n\n2000 years old viable seed is of the date palm, Phoenix dactylifera\n\ndiscovered during the archeological excavation at King Herod’s palace\n\nnear the Dead Sea.\n\nAfter completing a brief account of sexual reproduction of flowering\n\nplants it would be worth attempting to comprehend the enormous\n\nreproductive capacity of some flowering plants by asking  the following\n\nquestions:  How many eggs are present in an embryo sac? How many\n\nembryo sacs are present in an ovule? How many ovules are present in\n\nan ovary? How many ovaries are present in a typical flower? How many\n\nflowers are present on a tree? And so on...\n\nCan you think of some plants in which fruits contain very large\n\nnumber of seeds. Orchid fruits are one such category and each fruit\n\ncontain thousands of tiny seeds. Similar is the case in fruits of some\n\nparasitic species such as Orobanche and Striga.  Have you seen a tiny\n\nseed of Ficus? How large is the tree of Ficus developed from that tiny\n\nseed. How many billions of seeds does each Ficus tree produce? Can\n\nyou imagine any other example in which such a tiny structure can\n\nproduce such a large biomass over the years?\n\n2.5  APOMIXIS AND POLYEMBRYONY\n\nAlthough seeds, in general are the products of fertilisation, a few flowering\n\nplants such as some species of Asteraceae and grasses, have evolved a\n\nspecial mechanism, to produce seeds without fertilisation, called apomixis.\n\nWhat is fruit production without fertilisation called? Thus, apomixis is a\n\nform of asexual reproduction that mimics sexual reproduction. There are\n\nseveral ways of development of apomictic seeds. In some species, the\n\ndiploid egg cell is formed without reduction division and develops into\n\nthe embryo without fertilisation. More often, as in many Citrus and Mango\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n39\n\nHUMAN REPRODUCTIONSEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN FLOWERING PLANTS\n\nSUMMARY\n\nFlowers are the seat of sexual reproduction in angiosperms.  In the flower,\nandroecium consisting of stamens represents the male reproductive\norgans and gynoecium consisting of pistils represents the female\nreproductive organs.\n\nA typical anther is bilobed, dithecous and tetrasporangiate.  Pollen\ngrains develop inside the microsporangia.  Four wall layers, the\nepidermis, endothecium, middle layers and the tapetum surround the\nmicrosporangium. Cells of the  sporogenous tissue lying in the centre of\nthe microsporangium, undergo meiosis (microsporogenesis) to form\ntetrads of microspores.  Individual microspores mature into pollen grains.\n\nPollen grains represents the male gametophytic generation.  The\npollen grains have a two-layered wall, the outer exine and inner intine.\nThe exine is made up of sporopollenin and has germ pores.  Pollen grains\nmay have two cells (a vegetative cell and generative cell) or three cells (a\nvegetative cell and two male gametes) at the time of shedding.\n\nThe pistil has three parts – the stigma, style and the ovary.  Ovules\nare present in the ovary. The ovules have a stalk called funicle, protective\nintegument(s), and an opening called micropyle. The central tissue is\nthe nucellus in which the archesporium differentiates. A cell of the\narchesporium, the megaspore mother cell divides meiotically and one of\nthe megaspores forms the embryo sac (the female gametophyte). The\nmature embryo sac is 7-celled and 8-nucleate.  At the micropylar end is\n\nvarieties some of the nucellar cells surrounding the embryo sac start\n\ndividing, protrude into the embryo sac and develop into the embryos. In\n\nsuch species each ovule contains many embryos. Occurrence of more\n\nthan one embryo in a seed is referred to as polyembryony. Take out\n\nsome seeds of orange and squeeze them. Observe the many embryos of\n\ndifferent sizes and shapes from each seed. Count the number of embryos\n\nin each seed. What would be the genetic nature of apomictic embryos?\n\nCan they be called clones?\n\nHybrid varieties of several of our food and vegetable crops are being\n\nextensively cultivated. Cultivation of hybrids has tremendously increased\n\nproductivity. One of the problems of hybrids is that hybrid seeds have\n\nto be produced every year. If the seeds collected from hybrids are sown,\n\nthe plants in the progeny will segregate and do not maintain hybrid\n\ncharacters. Production of hybrid seeds is costly and hence the cost of\n\nhybrid seeds become too expensive for the farmers. If  these hybrids are\n\nmade into apomicts, there is no segregation of characters in the hybrid\n\nprogeny. Then the farmers can keep on using the hybrid seeds to raise\n\nnew crop year after year and he does not have to buy hybrid seeds every\n\nyear. Because of the importance of apomixis in hybrid seed industry,\n\nactive research is going on in many laboratories around the world to\n\nunderstand the genetics of apomixis and to transfer apomictic genes\n\ninto hybrid varieties.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n40\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1.

At the centre is a large central cell\nwith two polar nuclei.\n\nPollination is the mechanism to transfer pollen grains from the\nanther to the stigma.  Pollinating agents are either abiotic (wind and\nwater) or biotic (animals).\n\nPollen-pistil interaction involves all events from the landing of pollen\ngrains on the stigma until the pollen tube enters the embryo sac (when\nthe pollen is compatible) or pollen inhibition (when the pollen is\nincompatible).  Following compatible pollination, pollen grain germinates\non the stigma and the resulting  pollen tube grow through the style,\nenter the ovules and finally discharges two male gametes in one of the\nsynergids.  Angiosperms exhibit double fertilisation because two fusion\nevents occur in each embryo sac, namely syngamy and triple fusion.\nThe products of these fusions are the diploid zygote and the triploid\nprimary endosperm nucleus (in the primary endosperm cell). Zygote\ndevelops into the embryo and the primary endosperm cell forms the\nendosperm tissue. Formation of endosperm always precedes\ndevelopment of the embryo.\n\nThe developing embryo passes through different stages such as\nthe proembryo, globular and heart-shaped stages before maturation.\nMature dicotyledonous embryo has two cotyledons and an embryonal\naxis with epicotyl and hypocotyl.  Embryos of monocotyledons have a\nsingle cotyledon.  After fertilisation, ovary develops into fruit and ovules\ndevelop into seeds.\n\nA phenomenon called apomixis is found in some angiosperms,\nparticularly in grasses. It results in the formation of seeds without\nfertilisation.  Apomicts have several advantages in horticulture and\nagriculture.\n\nSome angiosperms produce more than one embryo in their seed.\n\nThis phenomenon is called polyembryony.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n41\n\nHUMAN REPRODUCTIONSEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN FLOWERING PLANTS\n\n7.

This\n\nis followed by formation and development of blastocyst\n\nand its attachment to the uterine wall (implantation),\n\nembryonic development (gestation) and delivery of the\n\nbaby (parturition). You have learnt that these reproductive\n\nevents occur after puberty. There are remarkable\n\ndifferences between the reproductive events in the male\n\nand in the female, for example, sperm formation continues\n\neven in old men, but formation of ovum ceases in women\n\naround the age of fifty years. Let us examine the male and\n\nfemale reproductive systems in human.\n\n3.1 THE MALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM\n\nThe male reproductive system is located in the pelvis region\n\n(Figure 3.1a). It includes a pair of testes alongwith\n\naccessory ducts, glands and the external genitalia.\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\nHUMAN REPRODUCTION\n\n3.1 The Male Reproductive\n\nSystem\n\n3.2 The Female Reproductive\n\nSystem\n\n3.3 Gametogenesis\n\n3.4 Menstrual Cycle\n\n3.5 Fertilisation and\n\nImplantation\n\n3.6 Pregnancy and\n\nEmbryonic Development\n\n3.7 Parturition and Lactation\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nThe testes are situated outside the\n\nabdominal cavity within a pouch\n\ncalled scrotum. The scrotum helps\n\nin maintaining the low temperature\n\nof the testes (2–2.5o C lower than\n\nthe normal internal body\n\ntemperature) necessary for\n\nspermatogenesis. In adults, each\n\ntestis is oval in shape, with a length\n\nof about 4 to 5 cm and a width of\n\nabout 2 to 3 cm. The testis is\n\ncovered by a dense covering. Each\n\ntestis has about 250 compartments\n\ncalled testicular lobules\n\n(Figure 3.1b).\n\nEach lobule contains one to\n\nthree highly coiled seminiferous\n\ntubules in which sperms are\n\nproduced. Each seminiferous tubule\n\nis lined on its inside by two types\n\nof cells called male germ cells\n\n(spermatogonia) and Sertoli cells\n\n(Figure 3.2 ). The male germ cells\n\nundergo meiotic divisions finally\n\nleading to sperm formation, while\n\nSertoli cells provide nutrition to the\n\ngerm cells. The regions outside the\n\nseminiferous tubules called\n\ninterstitial spaces, contain small\n\nblood vessels and interstitial cells\n\nor Leydig cells (Figure 3.2). Leydig\n\ncells synthesise and secrete\n\ntesticular hormones called\n\nandrogens. Other  immunologically\n\ncompetent cells are also present.\n\nThe male sex accessory ducts include rete testis, vasa efferentia,\n\nepididymis and vas deferens (Figure 3.1b). The seminiferous tubules of\n\nthe testis open into the vasa efferentia through rete testis. The vasa efferentia\n\nleave the testis and open into epididymis located along the posterior surface\n\nof each testis. The epididymis leads to vas deferens that ascends to the\n\nabdomen and loops over the urinary bladder. It receives a duct from seminal\n\nvesicle and opens into urethra as the ejaculatory duct (Figure 3.1a). These\n\nducts store and transport the sperms from the testis to the outside through\n\nurethra. The urethra originates from the urinary bladder and extends\n\nthrough the penis to its external opening called urethral meatus.\n\nFigure 3.1(a) Diagrammatic sectional view of male pelvis\nshowing reproductive system\n\nFigure 3.1(b) Diagrammatic view of male reproductive system\n(part of testis is open to show inner details)\n\n43\n\nHUMAN REPRODUCTION\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n44\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nThe penis is the male external genitalia (Figure 3.1a, b). It is made up\n\nof special tissue that helps in erection of the penis to facilitate insemination.\n\nThe enlarged end of penis called the glans penis is covered by a loose fold\n\nof skin called foreskin.\n\nThe male accessory glands (Figure 3.1a, b) include paired seminal\n\nvesicles, a prostate and paired bulbourethral glands. Secretions of these\n\nglands constitute the seminal plasma which is rich in fructose, calcium\n\nand certain enzymes. The secretions of bulbourethral glands also helps\n\nin the lubrication of the penis.\n\n3.2 THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM\n\nThe female reproductive system consists of a pair of ovaries alongwith a pair\n\nof oviducts, uterus, cervix, vagina and the external genitalia located in\n\npelvic region (Figure 3.3a). These parts of the system alongwith a pair of the\n\nmammary glands are integrated structurally and functionally to support\n\nthe processes of ovulation, fertilisation, pregnancy, birth and child care.\n\nOvaries are the primary female sex organs that produce the female\n\ngamete (ovum) and several steroid hormones (ovarian hormones).\n\nThe ovaries are located one on each side of the lower abdomen\n\n(Figure 3.3b). Each ovary is about 2 to 4 cm in length and is connected to\n\nthe pelvic wall and uterus by ligaments. Each ovary is covered by a thin\n\nepithelium which encloses the ovarian stroma. The stroma is divided into\n\ntwo zones – a peripheral cortex and an inner medulla.\n\nFigure 3.2 Diagrammatic sectional view of seminiferous tubule\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n45\n\nHUMAN REPRODUCTION\n\nThe oviducts (fallopian tubes), uterus and vagina constitute the female\n\naccessory ducts. Each fallopian tube is about 10-12 cm long and extends\n\nfrom the periphery of each ovary to the uterus (Figure 3.3b), the part closer\n\nto the ovary is the funnel-shaped infundibulum. The edges of the\n\ninfundibulum possess finger-like projections called fimbriae, which help in\n\ncollection of the ovum after ovulation. The infundibulum leads to a wider\n\nFigure 3.3 (b) Diagrammatic sectional view of the female reproductive system\n\nFigure 3.3 (a) Diagrammatic sectional view of female pelvis showing\nreproductive system\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n46\n\nBIOLOGY\n\npart of the oviduct called ampulla. The last part of the oviduct, isthmus has\n\na narrow lumen and it joins the uterus.\n\nThe uterus is single and it is also called womb. The shape of the uterus\n\nis like an inverted pear. It is supported by ligaments attached to the pelvic\n\nwall. The uterus opens into vagina through a narrow cervix. The cavity of\n\nthe cervix is called cervical canal (Figure 3.3b) which alongwith vagina\n\nforms the birth canal. The wall of the uterus has three layers of tissue. The\n\nexternal thin membranous perimetrium, middle thick layer of smooth\n\nmuscle, myometrium and inner glandular layer called endometrium that\n\nlines the uterine cavity. The endometrium undergoes cyclical changes during\n\nmenstrual cycle while the myometrium exhibits strong contraction during\n\ndelivery of the baby.\n\nThe female external genitalia include mons pubis, labia majora, labia\n\nminora, hymen and clitoris (Figure 3.3a). Mons pubis is a cushion of fatty\n\ntissue covered by skin and pubic hair. The labia majora are fleshy folds of\n\ntissue, which extend down from the mons pubis and surround the vaginal\n\nopening. The labia minora are paired folds of tissue under the labia majora.\n\nThe opening of the vagina is often covered partially by a membrane called\n\nhymen. The clitoris is a tiny finger-like structure which lies at the upper\n\njunction of the two labia minora above the urethral opening.  The hymen is\n\noften torn during the first coitus (intercourse). However, it can also be broken\n\nby a sudden fall or jolt, insertion of a vaginal tampon, active participation\n\nin some sports like horseback riding, cycling, etc. In some women the hymen\n\npersists even after coitus. In fact, the presence or absence of hymen is not\n\na reliable indicator of virginity or sexual experience.\n\nFigure 3.4 A diagrammatic sectional view of Mammary gland\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n47\n\nHUMAN REPRODUCTION\n\nA functional mammary gland is characteristic of all female mammals.\n\nThe mammary glands are paired structures (breasts) that contain\n\nglandular tissue and variable amount of fat. The glandular tissue of each\n\nbreast is divided into 15-20 mammary lobes containing clusters of cells\n\ncalled alveoli (Figure 3.4). The cells of alveoli secrete milk, which is stored\n\nin the cavities (lumens) of alveoli. The alveoli open into mammary tubules.\n\nThe tubules of each lobe join to form a mammary duct. Several mammary\n\nducts join to form a wider mammary ampulla which is connected to\n\nlactiferous duct through which milk is sucked out.\n\n3.3 GAMETOGENESIS\n\nThe primary sex organs – the testis in the males and the ovaries in the\n\nfemales – produce gametes, i.e, sperms and ovum, respectively, by the\n\nprocess called gametogenesis. In testis, the immature male germ cells\n\n(spermatogonia) produce sperms by spermatogenesis that begins at\n\npuberty.  The spermatogonia (sing. spermatogonium) present on the\n\ninside wall of seminiferous tubules multiply by mitotic division and\n\nincrease in numbers. Each spermatogonium is diploid and contains 46\n\nchromosomes. Some of the spermatogonia called primary\n\nspermatocytes periodically undergo meiosis. A primary spermatocyte\n\ncompletes the first meiotic division (reduction division) leading to\n\nformation of two equal,  haploid cells called\n\nsecondary spermatocytes, which have only\n\n23 chromosomes each. The secondary\n\nspermatocytes undergo the second meiotic\n\ndivision to produce four equal, haploid\n\nspermatids (Figure 3.5). What would be the\n\nnumber of chromosome in the spermatids?\n\nThe spermatids are transformed into\n\nspermatozoa (sperms) by the process called\n\nspermiogenesis. After spermiogenesis,\n\nsperm heads become embedded in the\n\nSertoli cells, and are finally released from\n\nthe seminiferous tubules by the process\n\ncalled spermiation.\n\nSpermatogenesis starts at the age of\n\npuberty due to significant increase in the\n\nsecretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone\n\n(GnRH). This, if you recall, is a hypothalamic hormone. The increased\n\nlevels of GnRH then acts at the anterior pituitary gland and stimulates\n\nsecretion of two gonadotropins – luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle\n\nstimulating hormone (FSH).  LH acts at the Leydig cells and stimulates\n\nsynthesis and secretion of androgens. Androgens, in turn, stimulate the\n\nprocess of spermatogenesis. FSH acts on the Sertoli cells and stimulates\n\nFigure 3.5 Diagrammatic sectional view of a\nseminiferous tubule (enlarged)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n48\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nsecretion of some factors which help in the\n\nprocess of spermiogenesis.\n\nLet us examine the structure of a sperm. It\n\nis a microscopic structure composed of a head,\n\nneck, a middle piece and a tail (Figure 3.6). A\n\nplasma membrane envelops the whole body of\n\nsperm. The sperm head contains an elongated\n\nhaploid nucleus, the anterior portion of which\n\nis covered by a cap-like structure, acrosome.\n\nThe acrosome is filled with enzymes that help\n\nfertilisation of the ovum. The middle piece\n\npossesses numerous mitochondria, which\n\nproduce energy for the movement of  tail that\n\nfacilitate sperm motility essential for fertilisation.\n\nThe human male ejaculates about 200 to 300\n\nmillion sperms during a coitus of which, for\n\nnormal fertility, at least 60 per cent sperms\n\nmust have normal shape and size and at least\n\n40 per cent of them must show vigorous\n\nmotility.\n\nSperms released from the seminiferous\n\ntubules, are transported by the accessory\n\nducts. Secretions of epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicle and\n\nprostate are essential for maturation and motility of sperms. The seminal\n\nplasma along with the sperms constitute the semen. The functions of\n\nmale sex accessory ducts and glands are maintained by the testicular\n\nhormones (androgens).\n\nThe process of formation of a mature female gamete is called oogenesis\n\nwhich is markedly different from spermatogenesis. Oogenesis is initiated\n\nduring the embryonic development stage when a couple of million gamete\n\nmother cells (oogonia) are formed within each fetal ovary; no more oogonia\n\nare formed and added after birth. These cells start division and enter into\n\nprophase-I of the meiotic division and get temporarily arrested at that stage,\n\ncalled primary oocytes. Each primary oocyte then gets surrounded by a\n\nlayer of granulosa cells and is called the primary follicle (Figure 3.7). A\n\nlarge number of these follicles degenerate during the phase from birth to\n\npuberty. Therefore, at puberty only 60,000-80,000 primary follicles are\n\nleft in each ovary. The primary follicles get surrounded by more layers of\n\ngranulosa cells and a new theca and are called secondary follicles.\n\nThe secondary follicle soon transforms into a tertiary follicle which is\n\ncharacterised by a fluid filled cavity called antrum. The theca layer is\n\norganised into an inner theca interna and an outer theca externa. It is\n\nimportant to draw your attention that it is at this stage that the primary\n\noocyte within the tertiary follicle grows in size and completes its first meiotic\n\ndivision. It is an unequal division resulting in the formation of a large\n\nhaploid secondary oocyte and a tiny first polar body (Figure 3.8b). The\n\nFigure 3.6 Structure of a sperm\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n49\n\nHUMAN REPRODUCTION\n\nsecondary oocyte retains bulk of the\n\nnutrient rich cytoplasm of the primary\n\noocyte. Can you think of any advantage\n\nfor this? Does the first polar body born\n\nout of first meiotic division divide further\n\nor degenerate?  At present we are not\n\nvery certain about this. The tertiary\n\nfollicle further changes into the mature\n\nfollicle or Graafian follicle (Figure 3.7).\n\nThe secondary oocyte forms a new\n\nmembrane called zona pellucida\n\nsurrounding it. The Graafian follicle now\n\nruptures to release the secondary oocyte\n\n(ovum) from the ovary by the\n\nprocess called ovulation. Can you\n\nidentify major differences between\n\nspermatogenesis and oogenesis?  A diagrammatic representation of\n\nspermatogenesis and oogenesis is given below (Figure 3.8).\n\nFigure 3.7 Diagrammatic Section view of ovary\n\nFigure 3.8 Schematic representation of (a) Spermatogenesis; (b) Oogenesis\n\n(a) (b)\n\n3.4 MENSTRUAL CYCLE\n\nThe reproductive cycle in the female primates (e.g. monkeys, apes and\n\nhuman beings) is called menstrual cycle. The first menstruation begins\n\nat puberty and is called menarche. In human females, menstruation\n\nis repeated at an average interval of about 28/29 days, and the cycle of\n\nevents starting from one menstruation till the next one is called the\n\nmenstrual cycle. One ovum is released (ovulation) during the middle\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n50\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nFigure 3.9 Diagrammatic presentation of various events during a menstrual cycle\n\nof each menstrual cycle. The major events of the menstrual cycle are\n\nshown in Figure 3.9. The cycle starts with the menstrual phase, when\n\nmenstrual flow occurs and it lasts for 3-5 days. The menstrual flow\n\nresults due to breakdown of endometrial lining of the uterus and its\n\nblood vessels which forms liquid that comes out through vagina.\n\nMenstruation only occurs if the released ovum is not fertilised. Lack of\n\nmenstruation may be indicative of pregnancy. However, it may also be\n\ncaused due to some other underlying causes like stress, poor health etc.\n\nThe menstrual phase is followed by the follicular phase. During\n\nthis phase, the primary follicles in the ovary grow to become a\n\nfully mature Graafian follicle and simultaneously the endometrium\n\nof uterus regenerates through proliferation. These changes in the\n\novary and the uterus are induced by changes in the levels of\n\npituitary and ovarian hormones (Figure 3.9). The secretion of\n\n\n\n51\n\nHUMAN REPRODUCTION\n\ngonadotropins (LH and FSH) increases gradually during the follicular\n\nphase, and stimulates follicular development as well as secretion of\n\nestrogens by the growing follicles. Both LH and FSH attain a peak level\n\nin the middle of cycle (about 14th day). Rapid secretion of LH leading to\n\nits maximum level during the mid-cycle called LH surge induces rupture\n\nof Graafian follicle and thereby the release of ovum (ovulation). The\n\novulation (ovulatory phase) is followed by the luteal phase during which\n\nthe remaining parts of the Graafian follicle transform as the corpus\n\nluteum (Figure 3.9). The corpus luteum secretes large amounts of\n\nprogesterone which is essential for maintenance of the endometrium.\n\nSuch an endometrium is necessary for implantation of the fertilised\n\novum and other events of pregnancy. During pregnancy all events of\n\nthe menstrual cycle stop and there is no menstruation.  In the absence\n\nof fertilisation, the corpus luteum degenerates. This causes disintegration\n\nof the endometrium leading to menstruation, marking a new cycle.  In\n\nhuman beings, menstrual cycles ceases around 50 years of age; that is\n\ntermed as menopause. Cyclic menstruation is an indicator of normal\n\nreproductive phase and extends between menarche and menopause.\n\n3.5 FERTILISATION AND IMPLANTATION\n\nDuring copulation (coitus) semen is released by the penis into the vagina\n\n(insemination). The motile sperms swim rapidly, pass through the cervix,\n\nenter into the uterus and finally reach the ampullary region of the\n\nfallopian tube (Figure 3.11b). The ovum released by the ovary is also\n\ntransported to the ampullary region\n\nwhere fertilisation takes place.\n\nFertilisation can only occur if the\n\novum and sperms are transported\n\nsimultaneously to the ampullary\n\nregion.  This is the reason why not all\n\ncopulations lead to fertilisation and\n\npregnancy.\n\nThe process of fusion of a sperm\n\nwith an ovum is called fertilisation.\n\nDuring fertilisation, a sperm comes in\n\ncontact with the zona pellucida layer\n\nof the ovum  (Figure 3.10) and induces\n\nchanges in the membrane  that block\n\nthe entry of additional sperms.  Thus,\n\nit ensures that only one sperm can\n\nfertilise an ovum.  The secretions of the\n\nacrosome help the sperm enter into the\n\ncytoplasm of the ovum through the\n\nzona pellucida and the plasma\nFigure 3.10 Ovum surrounded by few sperms\n\n51\n\nMaintenance of\nhygiene and sanitation\nduring menstruation is\nvery important. Take\nbath and clean yourself\nregulary. Use sanitary\nnapkins or clean\nhomemade pads.\nChange sanitary\nnapkins or homemade\npads after every 4–5 hrs\nas per the requirement.\nDispose of the used\nsanitary napkins\nproperly wrapping it\nwith a used paper. Do\nnot throw the used\nnapkins in the\ndrainpipe of toilets or\nin the open area. After\nhandling the napkin\nwash hands with soap.\n\nMenstrual  Hygiene\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n52\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nFigure 3.11 Transport of ovum, fertilisation and passage of growing embryo through fallopian tube\n\nmembrane. This induces the completion of the meiotic division of the\n\nsecondary oocyte. The second meiotic division is also unequal and results\n\nin the formation of a second polar body and a haploid ovum (ootid). Soon\n\nthe haploid nucleus of the sperms and that of the ovum fuse together to\n\nform a diploid zygote.  How many chromosomes will be there in the zygote?\n\nOne has to remember that the sex of the baby has been decided at this\n\nstage itself. Let us see how? As you know the chromosome pattern in the\n\nhuman female is XX and that in the male is XY. Therefore, all the haploid\n\ngametes (ova) produced by the female have the sex chromosome X whereas\n\nin the male gametes (sperms) the sex chromosome could be either X or Y,\n\nhence, 50 per cent of sperms carry the X chromosome while the other 50 per\n\ncent carry the Y. After fusion of the male and female gametes the zygote\n\nwould carry either XX or XY depending on whether the sperm carrying X\n\nor Y fertilised the ovum. The zygote carrying XX would develop into a female\n\nbaby and XY would form a male (you will learn more about the chromosomal\n\npatterns in Chapter 5). That is why, scientifically it is correct to say that the\n\nsex of the baby is determined by the father and not by the mother!\n\nThe mitotic division  starts as the zygote moves through the isthmus\n\nof the oviduct called cleavage towards the uterus (Figure 3.11) and forms\n\n2, 4, 8, 16 daughter cells called blastomeres. The embryo with 8 to 16\n\n\n\n53\n\nHUMAN REPRODUCTION\n\nblastomeres is called a morula (Figure 3.11e). The morula continues to\n\ndivide and transforms into blastocyst (Figure 3.11g) as it moves further\n\ninto the uterus. The blastomeres in the blastocyst are arranged into an\n\nouter layer called trophoblast and an inner group of cells attached to\n\ntrophoblast called the inner cell mass. The trophoblast layer then gets\n\nattached to the endometrium and the inner cell mass gets differentiated\n\nas the embryo. After attachment, the uterine cells divide rapidly and covers\n\nthe blastocyst. As a result, the blastocyst becomes embedded in the\n\nendometrium of the uterus (Figure 3.11h). This is called implantation\n\nand it leads to pregnancy.\n\n3.6 PREGNANCY AND EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT\n\nAfter implantation, finger-like projections appear on the trophoblast called\n\nchorionic villi which are surrounded by the uterine tissue and maternal\n\nblood. The chorionic villi and uterine tissue become interdigitated with\n\neach other and jointly form a structural and functional unit between\n\ndeveloping embryo (foetus) and maternal body called placenta (Figure 3.12).\n\nThe placenta facilitate the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the\n\nembryo and also removal of carbon dioxide and excretory/waste materials\n\nproduced by the embryo. The placenta is connected to the embryo through\n\nan umbilical cord which helps in the transport of substances to and from\n\nthe embryo. Placenta also acts as an endocrine tissue and produces\n\nseveral hormones like human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), human\n\nplacental lactogen (hPL), estrogens, progestogens, etc. In the later\n\nphase of pregnancy, a hormone called relaxin is also secreted by\n\nthe ovary. Let us remember\n\nthat hCG, hPL and relaxin\n\nare produced in women\n\nonly during pregnancy. In\n\naddition, during pregnancy\n\nthe levels of other hormones\n\nlike estrogens, progestogens,\n\ncortisol, prolactin, thyroxine,\n\netc., are increased several-\n\nfolds in the maternal blood.\n\nIncreased production of these\n\nhormones is essential for\n\nsupporting the fetal growth,\n\nmetabolic changes in the\n\nmother and maintenance of\n\npregnancy.\n\nImmediately after\n\nimplantation, the inner cell\n\nmass (embryo) differentiates Figure 3.12 The human foetus within the uterus\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n54\n\nBIOLOGY\n\ninto an outer layer called ectoderm and an inner layer called endoderm. A\n\nmesoderm soon appears between the ectoderm and the endoderm. These\n\nthree layers give rise to all tissues (organs) in adults. It needs to be mentioned\n\nhere that the inner cell mass contains certain cells called stem cells which\n\nhave the potency to give rise to all the tissues and organs.\n\nWhat are the major features of embryonic development at various\n\nmonths of pregnancy?  The human pregnancy lasts 9 months. Do you\n\nknow for  how many months pregnancy last in dogs, elephants, cats?\n\nFind out. In human beings, after one month of pregnancy, the embryo’s\n\nheart is formed. The first sign of growing foetus may be noticed by listening\n\nto the  heart sound carefully through the stethoscope. By the end of the\n\nsecond month of pregnancy, the foetus develops limbs and digits. By the\n\nend of 12 weeks (first trimester), most of the major organ systems are\n\nformed, for example, the limbs and external genital organs are well-\n\ndeveloped. The first movements of the foetus and appearance of hair on\n\nthe head are usually observed during the fifth month. By the end of about\n\n24 weeks (end of second trimester), the body is covered with fine hair,\n\neye-lids separate, and eyelashes are formed.  By the end of nine months\n\nof pregnancy, the foetus is fully developed and is ready for delivery.\n\n3.7 PARTURITION AND LACTATION\n\nThe average duration of human pregnancy is about 9 months\n\nwhich is called the gestation period. Vigorous contraction of the uterus at\n\nthe end of pregnancy causes expulsion/delivery of the foetus. This process\n\nof delivery of the foetus (childbirth) is called parturition. Parturition is\n\ninduced by a complex neuroendocrine mechanism. The signals for\n\nparturition originate from the fully developed foetus and the placenta\n\nwhich induce mild uterine contractions called foetal ejection reflex. This\n\ntriggers release of oxytocin from the maternal pituitary. Oxytocin acts on\n\nthe uterine muscle and causes stronger uterine contractions, which in\n\nturn stimulates further secretion of oxytocin. The stimulatory reflex between\n\nthe uterine contraction and oxytocin secretion continues resulting in\n\nstronger and stronger contractions. This leads to expulsion of the baby\n\nout of the uterus through the birth canal – parturition. Soon after the\n\ninfant is delivered, the placenta is also expelled out of the uterus. What do\n\nyou think the doctors inject to induce delivery?\n\nThe mammary glands of the female undergo differentiation during\n\npregnancy and starts producing milk towards the end of pregnancy by\n\nthe process called lactation. This helps the mother in feeding the new-\n\nborn. The milk produced during the initial few days of lactation is called\n\ncolostrum which contains several antibodies absolutely essential to\n\ndevelop resistance for the new-born babies. Breast-feeding during the\n\ninitial period of infant growth is recommended by doctors for bringing up\n\na healthy baby.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n55\n\nHUMAN REPRODUCTION\n\nSUMMARY\n\nHumans are sexually reproducing and viviparous. The male\nreproductive system is composed of a pair of testes, the male sex\naccessory ducts and the accessory glands and external genitalia. Each\ntestis has about 250 compartments called testicular lobules, and each\nlobule contains one to three highly coiled seminiferous tubules. Each\nseminiferous tubule is lined inside by spermatogonia and Sertoli cells.\nThe spermatogonia undergo meiotic divisions leading to sperm formation,\nwhile Sertoli cells provide nutrition to the dividing germ cells. The Leydig\ncells outside the seminiferous tubules, synthesise and secrete testicular\nhormones called androgens. The male external genitalia is called penis.\n\nThe female reproductive system consists of a pair of ovaries, a pair\nof oviducts, a uterus, a vagina, external genitalia, and a pair of\nmammary glands. The ovaries produce the female gamete (ovum) and\nsome steroid hormones (ovarian hormones). Ovarian follicles in different\nstages of development are embedded in the stroma. The oviducts, uterus\nand vagina are female accessory ducts. The uterus has three layers\nnamely perimetrium, myometrium and endometrium. The female\nexternal genitalia includes mons pubis, labia majora, labia minora,\nhymen and clitoris. The mammary glands are one of the female\nsecondary sexual characteristics.\n\nSpermatogenesis results in the formation of sperms that are\ntransported by the male sex accessory ducts. A normal human sperm\nis composed of a head, neck, a middle piece and tail. The process of\nformation of mature female gametes is called oogenesis. The\nreproductive cycle of female primates is called menstrual cycle.\nMenstrual cycle starts only after attaining sexual maturation (puberty).\nDuring ovulation only one ovum is released per menstrual cycle. The\ncyclical changes in the ovary and the uterus during menstrual cycle\nare induced by changes in the levels of pituitary and ovarian hormones.\nAfter coitus, sperms are transported to the junction of the isthmus and\nampulla, where the sperm fertilises the ovum leading to formation of a\ndiploid zygote. The presence of X or Y chromosome in the sperm\ndetermines the sex of the embryo. The zygote undergoes repeated mitotic\ndivision to form a blastocyst, which is implanted in the uterus resulting\nin pregnancy. After nine months of pregnancy, the fully developed  foetus\nis ready for delivery. The process of childbirth is called parturition which\nis induced by a complex neuroendocrine mechanism involving cortisol,\nestrogens and oxytocin. Mammary glands differentiate during pregnancy\nand secrete milk after child-birth. The new-born baby is fed milk by the\nmother (lactation) during the initial few months of growth.\n\nEXERCISES\n1.

Now, let’s discuss a closely related\ntopic – reproductive health. What do we understand by\nthis term?  The term simply refers to healthy reproductive\norgans with normal functions. However, it has a broader\nperspective and includes the emotional and social aspects\nof reproduction also. According to the World Health\nOrganisation (WHO), reproductive health means a total\nwell-being in all aspects of reproduction, i.e., physical,\nemotional, behavioural and social. Therefore, a society with\npeople having physically and functionally normal\nreproductive organs and normal emotional and behavioural\ninteractions among them in all sex-related aspects might\nbe called reproductively healthy. Why is it significant to\nmaintain reproductive health and what are the methods\ntaken up to achieve it? Let us examine them.\n\n4.1 REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH – PROBLEMS AND\nSTRATEGIES\n\nIndia was amongst the first countries in the world to\n\ninitiate action plans and programmes at a national level\n\nto attain total reproductive health as a social goal.\n\nThese programmes called ‘family planning’ were\n\ninitiated in 1951 and were periodically assessed over\n\nthe past decades. Improved programmes covering wider\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\nREPRODUCTIVE HEALTH\n\n4.1 Reproductive Health –\n\nProblems and Strategies\n\n4.2 Population Explosion\n\nand Birth Control\n\n4.3 Medical Termination of\n\nPregnancy\n\n4.4 Sexually Transmitted\n\nDiseases\n\n4.5 Infertility\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n58\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nreproduction-related areas are currently in operation under the\n\npopular name ‘Reproductive and Child Health Care (RCH) programmes’.\n\nCreating awareness among people about various reproduction related\n\naspects and providing facilities and support for building up a\n\nreproductively healthy society are the major tasks under these\n\nprogrammes.\n\nWith the help of audio-visual and the print-media governmental and\n\nnon-governmental agencies have taken various steps to create awareness\n\namong the people about reproduction-related aspects. Parents, other\n\nclose relatives, teachers and friends, also have a major role in the\n\ndissemination of the above information. Introduction of sex education\n\nin schools should also be encouraged to provide right information to\n\nthe young so as to discourage children from believing in myths and\n\nhaving misconceptions about sex-related aspects. Proper information\n\nabout reproductive organs, adolescence and related changes, safe and\n\nhygienic sexual practices, sexually transmitted diseases (STD), AIDS,\n\netc., would help people, especially those in the adolescent age group to\n\nlead a reproductively healthy life. Educating people, especially fertile\n\ncouples and those in marriageable age group, about available birth\n\ncontrol options, care of pregnant mothers, post-natal care of the mother\n\nand child, importance of breast feeding, equal opportunities for the male\n\nand the female child, etc., would address the importance of bringing up\n\nsocially conscious healthy families of desired size. Awareness of problems\n\ndue to uncontrolled population growth, social evils like sex-abuse and\n\nsex-related crimes, etc., need to be created to enable people to think\n\nand take up necessary steps to prevent them and thereby build up a\n\nsocially responsible and healthy society.\n\nSuccessful implementation of various action plans to attain\n\nreproductive health requires strong infrastructural facilities, professional\n\nexpertise and material support. These are essential to provide medical\n\nassistance and care to people in reproduction-related problems like\n\npregnancy, delivery, STDs, abortions, contraception, menstrual problems,\n\ninfertility, etc. Implementation of better techniques and new strategies\n\nfrom time to time are also required to provide more efficient care\n\nand assistance to people. Statutory ban on amniocentesis for\n\nsex-determination to legally check increasing menace of female foeticides,\n\nmassive child immunisation, etc., are some programmes that merit\n\nmention in this connection. In aminocentesis some of the amniotic fluid\n\nof the developing foetus is taken to analyse the fetal cells and dissolved\n\nsubstances. This procedure is used to test for the presence of certain\n\ngenetic disorders such as, down syndrome, haemoplilia, sickle-cell\n\nanemia, etc., determine the survivability of the foetus.\n\nResearch on various reproduction-related areas are encouraged and\n\nsupported by governmental and non-governmental agencies to find out\n\nnew methods and/or to improve upon the existing ones. Do you know\n\nthat ‘Saheli’–a new oral contraceptive for the females–was developed\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n59\n\nREPRODUCTIVE HEALTH\n\nby scientists at Central Drug Research Institute (CDRI) in Lucknow, India?\n\nBetter awareness about sex related matters, increased number of medically\n\nassisted deliveries and better post-natal care leading to decreased maternal\n\nand infant mortality rates, increased number of couples with small\n\nfamilies, better detection and cure of STDs and overall increased medical\n\nfacilities for all sex-related problems, etc. all indicate improved reproductive\n\nhealth of the society.\n\n4.2 POPULATION STABILISATION AND BIRTH CONTROL\n\nIn the last century an all-round development in various fields significantly\n\nimproved the quality of life of the people. However, increased health\n\nfacilities along with better living conditions had an explosive impact on\n\nthe growth of population. The world population which was around\n\n2 billion (2000 million) in 1900 rocketed to about 6 billion  by 2000 and\n\n7.2 billion in 2011. A similar trend was observed in India too. Our\n\npopulation which was approximately 350 million at the time of our\n\nindependence reached close to the billion mark by 2000 and crossed\n\n1.2 billion in May 2011. A rapid decline in death rate, maternal mortality\n\nrate (MMR) and infant mortality rate (IMR) as well as an increase in\n\nnumber of people in reproducible age are probable reasons for this.\n\nThrough our Reproductive Child Health (RCH) programme, though we\n\ncould bring down the population growth rate, it was only marginal.\n\nAccording to the 2011 census report, the population growth rate was\n\nless than 2 per cent, i.e., 20/1000/year, a rate at which our population\n\ncould increase rapidly. Such an alarming growth rate could lead to an\n\nabsolute scarcity of even the basic requirements, i.e., food, shelter and\n\nclothing, in spite of significant progress made in those areas. Therefore,\n\nthe government was forced to take up serious measures to check this\n\npopulation growth rate.\n\nThe most important step to overcome this problem is to motivate smaller\n\nfamilies by using various contraceptive methods. You might have seen\n\nadvertisements in the media as well as posters/bills, etc., showing a happy\n\ncouple with two children with a slogan Hum Do Hamare Do (we two, our\n\ntwo). Many couples, mostly the young, urban, working ones have even\n\nadopted an ‘one child norm’. Statutory raising of marriageable age of the\n\nfemale to 18 years and that of males to 21 years, and incentives given to\n\ncouples with small families are two of the other measures taken to tackle\n\nthis problem. Let us describe some of the commonly used contraceptive\n\nmethods, which help prevent unwanted pregnancies.\n\nAn ideal contraceptive should be user-friendly, easily available,\n\neffective and reversible with no or least side-effects. It also should in no\n\nway interfere with the sexual drive, desire and/or the sexual act of the\n\nuser. A wide range of contraceptive methods are presently available which\n\ncould be broadly grouped into the following categories, namely\n\nNatural/Traditional, Barrier, IUDs, Oral contraceptives, Injectables,\n\nImplants and Surgical methods.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n60\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nFigure 4.2. Copper T (CuT)\n\nNatural methods work on the principle of avoiding chances of ovum\n\nand sperms meeting. Periodic abstinence is one such method in which\n\nthe couples avoid or abstain from coitus from day 10 to 17 of the menstrual\n\ncycle when ovulation could be expected. As chances of fertilisation are\n\nvery high during this period, it is called the fertile period. Therefore, by\n\nabstaining from coitus during this period, conception could\n\nbe prevented. Withdrawal or coitus interruptus is another\n\nmethod in which the male partner withdraws his penis from\n\nthe vagina just before ejaculation so as to avoid\n\ninsemination. Lactational amenorrhea (absence of\n\nmenstruation) method is based on the fact that ovulation\n\nand therefore the cycle do not occur during the period of\n\nintense lactation following parturition. Therefore, as long\n\nas the mother breast-feeds the child fully, chances of\n\nconception are almost nil. However, this method has been\n\nreported to be effective only upto a maximum period of six\n\nmonths following parturition. As no medicines or devices\n\nare used in these methods, side effects are almost nil.\n\nChances of failure, though, of this method are also high.\n\nIn barrier methods, ovum and sperms are prevented\n\nfrom physically meeting with the help of barriers. Such\n\nmethods  are available for both males and females.\n\nCondoms (Figure 4.1 a, b) are barriers made of thin rubber/\n\nlatex sheath that are used to cover the penis in the male or\n\nvagina and cervix in the female, just before coitus so that\n\nthe ejaculated semen would not enter into the female\n\nreproductive tract. This can prevent conception. ‘Nirodh’ is\n\na popular brand of condom for the male. Use of condoms\n\nhas increased in recent years due to its additional benefit of\n\nprotecting the user from contracting STIs and AIDS. Both\n\nthe male and the female condoms are disposable, can be\n\nself-inserted and thereby gives privacy to the user.\n\nDiaphragms, cervical caps and vaults are also barriers\n\nmade of rubber that are inserted into the female reproductive\n\ntract to cover the cervix during coitus. They prevent\n\nconception by blocking the entry of sperms through the\n\ncervix. They are reusable. Spermicidal creams, jellies and\n\nfoams are usually used alongwith these barriers to increase\n\ntheir contraceptive efficiency.\n\nAnother effective and popular method is the use of Intra Uterine\n\nDevices (IUDs). These devices are inserted by doctors or expert nurses\n\nin the uterus through vagina.  These Intra Uterine Devices are presently\n\navailable as the non-medicated IUDs (e.g., Lippes loop), copper releasing\n\nIUDs (CuT, Cu7, Multiload 375) and the hormone releasing IUDs\n\n(Progestasert, LNG-20) (Figure 4.2). IUDs increase phagocytosis of sperms\n\nwithin the uterus and the Cu ions released suppress sperm motility and\n\nthe fertilising capacity of sperms. The hormone releasing IUDs, in addition,\n\nFigure 4.1(b) Condom for female\n\nFigure 4.1(a) Condom for male\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n61\n\nREPRODUCTIVE HEALTH\n\nmake the uterus unsuitable for implantation and the\n\ncervix hostile to the sperms. IUDs are ideal contraceptives\n\nfor the females who want to delay pregnancy and/or space\n\nchildren. It is one of most widely accepted methods of\n\ncontraception in India.\n\nOral administration of small doses of either progestogens\n\nor progestogen–estrogen combinations is another\n\ncontraceptive method used by the females. They are used\n\nin the form of tablets and hence are popularly called the\n\npills. Pills have to be taken daily for a period of 21 days\n\nstarting preferably within the first five days of menstrual\n\ncycle. After a gap of 7 days (during which menstruation\n\noccurs) it has to be repeated in the same pattern till the female desires to\n\nprevent conception. They inhibit ovulation and implantation as well as\n\nalter the quality of cervical mucus to prevent/retard entry of sperms. Pills\n\nare very effective with lesser side effects and are well accepted by the females.\n\nSaheli –the new oral contraceptive for the females contains a non-steroidal\n\npreparation. It is a ‘once a week’ pill with very few side effects and high\n\ncontraceptive value.\n\nProgestogens alone or in combination with estrogen can also be used\n\nby females as injections or implants under the skin (Figure 4.3). Their\n\nmode of action is similar to that of pills and their effective periods are\n\nmuch longer. Administration of progestogens or progestogen-estrogen\n\ncombinations or IUDs within 72 hours of coitus have been found to be\n\nvery effective as emergency contraceptives as they could be used to avoid\n\npossible pregnancy due to rape or casual unprotected intercourse.\n\nSurgical methods, also called sterilisation, are generally advised for\n\nthe male/female partner as a terminal method to prevent any more\n\nFigure 4.3 Implants\n\nFigure 4.4 (a) Vasectomy\nFigure 4.4 (b) Tubectomy\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n62\n\nBIOLOGY\n\npregnancies. Surgical intervention blocks gamete transport and thereby\n\nprevent conception. Sterilisation procedure in the male is called ‘vasectomy’\n\nand that in the female, ‘tubectomy’. In vasectomy, a small part of the vas\n\ndeferens is removed or tied up through a small incision on the scrotum\n\n(Figure 4.4a) whereas in tubectomy, a small part of the fallopian tube is\n\nremoved (Figure 4.4b) or tied up through a small incision in the abdomen\n\nor through vagina. These techniques are highly effective but their\n\nreversibility is very poor.\n\nIt needs to be emphasised that the selection of a suitable contraceptive\n\nmethod and its use should always be undertaken in consultation with\n\nqualified medical professionals. One must also remember that\n\ncontraceptives are not regular requirements for the maintenance of\n\nreproductive health. In fact, they are practiced against a natural\n\nreproductive event, i.e., conception/pregnancy. One is forced to use these\n\nmethods either to prevent pregnancy or to delay or space pregnancy due\n\nto personal reasons. No doubt, the widespread use of these methods have\n\na significant role in checking uncontrolled growth of population. However,\n\ntheir possible ill-effects like nausea, abdominal pain, breakthrough\n\nbleeding, irregular menstrual bleeding or even breast cancer, though not\n\nvery significant, should not be totally ignored.\n\n4.3 MEDICAL TERMINATION OF PREGNANCY (MTP)\n\nIntentional or voluntary termination of pregnancy before full term is called\n\nmedical termination of pregnancy (MTP) or induced abortion. Nearly\n\n45 to 50 million MTPs are performed in a year all over the world which\n\naccounts to 1/5th of the total number of conceived pregnancies in a year.\n\nWhether to accept / legalise MTP or not is being debated upon in many\n\ncountries due to emotional, ethical, religious and social issues involved\n\nin it. Government of India legalised MTP in 1971 with some strict conditions\n\nto avoid its misuse. Such restrictions are all the more important to check\n\nindiscriminate and illegal female foeticides which are reported to be high\n\nin India.\n\nWhy MTP? Obviously the answer is –to get rid of unwanted\n\npregnancies either due to casual unprotected intercourse or failure of the\n\ncontraceptive used during coitus or rapes. MTPs are also essential in\n\ncertain cases where continuation of the pregnancy could be harmful or\n\neven fatal either to the mother or to the foetus or both.\n\nMTPs are considered relatively safe during the first trimester, i.e., upto\n\n12 weeks of pregnancy. Second trimester abortions are much more riskier.\n\nOne disturbing trend observed is that a majority of the MTPs are performed\n\nillegally by unqualified quacks which are not only unsafe but could be\n\nfatal too. Another dangerous trend is the misuse of amniocentesis to\n\ndetermine the sex of the unborn child.  Frequently, if the foetus is found\n\nto be female, it is followed by MTP- this is totally against what is legal.\n\nThe Medical Termination\nof Pregnancy\n(Amendment) Act, 2017\nwas enacted by the\ngovernment of India with\nthe intension of\nreducing the incidence of\nillegal abortion and\nconsequent maternal\nmortality and morbidity.\nAccording to this Act, a\npregnancy may be\nterminated on certain\nconsidered grounds\nwithin the first 12 weeks\nof pregnancy on the\nopinion of one registered\nmedical practitioner. If\nthe pregnancy has lasted\nmore than 12 weeks, but\nfewer than 24 weeks, two\nregistered medical\npractitioners must be of\nthe opinion, formed in\ngood faith, that the\nrequired ground exist.\nThe grounds for such\ntermination of\npregnancies are:\n(i) The continuation of\n\nthe pregnancy would\ninvolve a risk to the\nlife of the pregnant\nwoman or of grave\ninjury physical or\nmental health; or\n\n(ii There is a\nsubstantial risk that\nof the child were\nborn, it would suffer\nfrom such physical\nor mental\nabnormalities as to\nbe seriously\nhandicapped.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n63\n\nREPRODUCTIVE HEALTH\n\nSuch practices should be avoided because these are dangerous both for\n\nthe young mother and the foetus. Effective counselling on the need to\n\navoid unprotected coitus and the risk factors involved in illegal abortions\n\nas well as providing more health care facilities could reverse the mentioned\n\nunhealthy trend.\n\n4.4 SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS (STIS)\n\nInfections or diseases which are transmitted through sexual intercourse\n\nare collectively called sexually transmitted infections  (STI) or venereal\n\ndiseases (VD) or reproductive tract infections (RTI). Gonorrhoea, syphilis,\n\ngenital herpes, chlamydiasis, genital warts, trichomoniasis, hepatitis-B\n\nand of course, the most discussed infection in the recent years, HIV leading\n\nto AIDS are some of the common STIs. Among these, HIV infection is\n\nmost dangerous and is discussed in detail in Chapter 8.\n\nSome of these infections like hepatitis–B and HIV can also be\n\ntransmitted by sharing of injection needles, surgical instruments, etc.,\n\nwith infected persons, transfusion of blood, or from an infected mother to\n\nthe foetus too. Except for hepatitis-B, genital herpes and HIV infections,\n\nother diseases are completely curable if detected early and treated\n\nproperly. Early symptoms of most of these are minor and include itching,\n\nfluid discharge, slight pain, swellings, etc., in the genital region. Infected\n\nfemales may often be asymptomatic and hence, may remain undetected\n\nfor long. Absence or less significant symptoms in the early stages of\n\ninfection and the social stigma attached to the STIs, deter the infected\n\npersons from going for timely detection and proper treatment. This could\n\nlead to complications later, which include pelvic inflammatory diseases\n\n(PID), abortions, still births, ectopic pregnancies, infertility or even cancer\n\nof the reproductive tract. STIs are a major threat to a healthy society.\n\nTherefore, prevention or early detection and cure of these diseases are\n\ngiven prime consideration under the reproductive health-care\n\nprogrammes. Though all persons are vulnerable to these infections, their\n\nincidences are reported to be very high among persons in the age group\n\nof 15-24 years – the age group to which you also belong. There is no\n\nreason to panic because prevention is possible. One could be free of these\n\ninfections by following the simple principles given below:\n\n(i) Avoid sex with unknown partners/multiple partners.\n\n(ii) Always try to use condoms during coitus.\n\n(iii) In case of doubt, one should go to a qualified doctor for early\n\ndetection and get complete treatment if diagnosed with infection.\n\n4.5 INFERTILITY\n\nA discussion on reproductive health is incomplete without a mention of\n\ninfertility. A large number of couples all over the world including India\n\nare infertile, i.e., they are unable to produce children inspite of unprotected\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n64\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nsexual co-habitation. The reasons for this could be many–physical,\n\ncongenital, diseases, drugs, immunological or even psychological.\n\nIn India, often the female is blamed for the couple being childless, but\n\nmore often than not, the problem lies in the male partner. Specialised\n\nhealth care units (infertility clinics, etc.) could help in diagnosis and\n\ncorrective treatment of some of these disorders and enable these couples to\n\nhave children. However, where such corrections are not possible, the couples\n\ncould be assisted to have children through certain special techniques\n\ncommonly known as assisted reproductive technologies (ART).\n\nIn vitro fertilisation (IVF–fertilisation outside the body in almost\n\nsimilar conditions as that in the body) followed by embryo transfer (ET)\n\nis one of such methods. In this method, popularly known as test tube\n\nbaby programme, ova from the wife/donor (female) and sperms from the\n\nhusband/donor (male) are collected and are induced to form zygote under\n\nsimulated conditions in the laboratory. The zygote or early embryos (with\n\nupto 8 blastomeres) could then be transferred into the fallopian tube\n\n(ZIFT–zygote intra fallopian transfer) and embryos with more than\n\n8 blastomeres, into the uterus (IUT – intra uterine transfer), to complete\n\nits further development. Embryos formed by in-vivo fertilisation (fusion\n\nof gametes within the female) also could be used for such transfer to assist\n\nthose females who cannot conceive.\n\nTransfer of an ovum collected from a donor into the fallopian tube\n\n(GIFT – gamete intra fallopian transfer) of another female who cannot\n\nproduce one, but can provide suitable environment for fertilisation and\n\nfurther development is another method attempted. Intra cytoplasmic\n\nsperm injection (ICSI) is another specialised procedure to form an embryo\n\nin the laboratory in which a sperm is directly injected into the ovum.\n\nInfertility cases either due to inability of the male partner to inseminate\n\nthe female or due to very low sperm counts in the ejaculates, could be\n\ncorrected by artificial insemination (AI) technique. In this technique,\n\nthe semen collected either from the husband or a healthy donor is artificially\n\nintroduced either into the vagina or into the uterus (IUI – intra-uterine\n\ninsemination) of the female.\n\nThough options are many, all these techniques require extremely high\n\nprecision handling by specialised professionals and expensive\n\ninstrumentation. Therefore, these facilities are presently available only in\n\nvery few centres in the country. Obviously their benefits is affordable to\n\nonly a limited number of people.  Emotional, religious and social factors\n\nare also deterrents in the adoption of these methods.  Since the ultimate\n\naim of all these procedures is to have children, in India we have so many\n\norphaned and destitute children, who would probably not survive till\n\nmaturity, unless taken care of. Our laws permit legal adoption and it is\n\nas yet, one of the best methods for couples looking for parenthood.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n65\n\nREPRODUCTIVE HEALTH\n\nSUMMARY\n\nReproductive health refers to a total well-being in all aspects of\n\nreproduction, i.e., physical, emotional, behavioural and social. Our\n\nnation was the first nation in the world to initiate various action plans\n\nat national level towards attaining a reproductively healthy society.\n\nCounselling and creating awareness among people about\n\nreproductive organs, adolescence and associated changes, safe and\n\nhygienic sexual practices, sexually transmitted infections (STIs)\n\nincluding AIDS, etc., is the primary step towards reproductive health.\n\nProviding medical facilities and care to the problems like menstrual\n\nirregularities, pregnancy related aspects, delivery, medical termination\n\nof pregnancy, STIs, birth control, infertility, post natal child and\n\nmaternal management is another important aspect of the Reproductive\n\nand Child Health Care programmes.\n\nAn overall improvement in reproductive health has taken place in\n\nour country as indicated by reduced maternal and infant mortality\n\nrates, early detection and cure of STIs, assistance to infertile couples,\n\netc. Improved health facilities and better living conditions promoted an\n\nexplosive growth of population. Such a growth necessitated intense\n\npropagation of contraceptive methods. Various contraceptive options\n\nare available now such as natural, traditional, barrier, IUDs, pills,\n\ninjectables, implants and surgical methods. Though contraceptives are\n\nnot regular requirements for reproductive health, one is forced to use\n\nthem to avoid pregnancy or to delay or space pregnancy.\n\nMedical termination of pregnancy is legalised in our country.  MTP is\n\ngenerally performed to get rid of unwanted pregnancy due to rapes, casual\n\nrelationship, etc., as also in cases when the continuation of pregnancy\n\ncould be harmful or even fatal to either the mother, or the foetus or both.\n\nInfections or diseases transmitted through sexual intercourse are\n\ncalled Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STIs). Pelvic Inflammatory\n\nDiseases (PIDs), still birth, infertility are some of the complications of\n\nthem.  Early detection facilitate better cure of these diseases.  Avoiding\n\nsexual intercourse with unknown/multiple partners, use of condoms\n\nduring coitus are some of the simple precautions to avoid  contracting\n\nSTIs.\n\nInability to conceive or produce children even after 2 years of\n\nunprotected sexual cohabitation is called infertility.

We\n\nmust, however, recognise that though our\n\nancestors knew about the inheritance of\n\ncharacters and variation, they had very\n\nlittle idea about the scientific basis of these\n\nphenomena.\n\n5.1 MENDEL’S LAWS OF INHERITANCE\n\nIt was during the mid-nineteenth century that\n\nheadway was made in the understanding of\n\ninheritance. Gregor Mendel, conducted\n\nhybridisation experiments on garden peas for\n\nseven years (1856-1863) and proposed the\n\nlaws of inheritance in living organisms. During\n\nMendel’s investigations into inheritance\n\npatterns it was for the first time that statistical\n\nanalysis and mathematical logic were applied\n\nto problems in biology. His experiments had a\n\nlarge sampling size, which gave greater\n\ncredibility to the data that he collected. Also,\n\nthe confirmation of his inferences from\n\nexperiments on successive generations of his\n\ntest plants, proved that his results pointed to\n\ngeneral rules of inheritance rather than being\n\nunsubstantiated ideas. Mendel investigated\n\ncharacters in the garden pea plant that were\n\nmanifested as two opposing traits, e.g., tall or\n\ndwarf plants, yellow or green seeds. This\n\nallowed him to set up a basic framework of\n\nrules governing inheritance, which was\n\nexpanded on by later scientists to account for\n\nall the diverse natural observations and the\n\ncomplexity inherent in them.\n\nMendel conducted such artificial\n\npollination/cross pollination experiments\n\nusing several  true-breeding pea lines. A true-\n\nbreeding line is one that, having undergone\n\ncontinuous self-pollination, shows the stable trait inheritance and\n\nexpression for several generations. Mendel selected 14 true-breeding pea\n\nplant varieties, as pairs which were similar except for one character with\n\ncontrasting traits. Some of the contrasting traits selected were smooth or\n\nwrinkled seeds, yellow or green seeds, inflated (full) or constricted green\n\nor yellow pods and tall or dwarf plants (Figure 5.1, Table 5.1).\n\nFigure 5.1 Seven pairs of contrasting traits in\npea plant studied by Mendel\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n71\n\nPRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE AND VARIATION\n\n5.2 INHERITANCE OF ONE GENE\n\nLet us take the example of one such\n\nhybridisation experiment carried out by\n\nMendel where he crossed tall and dwarf pea\n\nplants to study the inheritance of one gene\n\n(Figure 5.2). He collected the seeds produced\n\nas a result of this cross and grew them to\n\ngenerate plants of the first hybrid generation.\n\nThis generation is also called the Filial\n1\n\nprogeny or the F\n1\n. Mendel observed that all\n\nthe F\n1 \n progeny  plants were tall, like one of\n\nits parents; none were dwarf (Figure 5.3). He\n\nmade similar observations for the other pairs\n\nof traits – he found that the F\n1 \n\n always\n\nresembled either one of the parents, and that\n\nthe trait of the other parent was not seen in\n\nthem.\n\nMendel then self-pollinated the tall F\n1\n\nplants and to his surprise found  that in the\n\nFilial\n2\n generation some of the offspring were\n\n‘dwarf ’; the character that was not seen in\n\nthe F\n1\n generation was now expressed. The\n\nproportion of plants that were dwarf were\n\n1/4th of the F\n2\n plants while 3/4th of the F\n\n2\n plants were tall. The tall and\n\ndwarf traits were identical to their parental type and did not show any\n\nblending, that is all the offspring were either tall or dwarf, none were of in-\n\nbetween height (Figure 5.3).\n\nSimilar results were obtained with the other traits that he studied:\n\nonly one of the parental traits was expressed in the F\n1\n generation while at\n\nthe F\n2\n stage both the traits were expressed in the proportion 3:1. The\n\ncontrasting traits did not show any blending at either F\n1\n or F\n\n2\n stage.\n\nFigure 5.2 Steps in making a cross in pea\n\nTable 5.1: Contrasting Traits Studied by\n\nMendel in Pea\n\nS.No. Characters Contrasting Traits\n\n1.

Seed colour Yellow/green\n\n\n\n72\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nBased on these observations,\n\nMendel proposed that something\n\nwas being stably passed down,\n\nunchanged, from parent to offspring\n\nthrough the gametes, over\n\nsuccessive generations. He called\n\nthese things as ‘factors’. Now we call\n\nthem as genes. Genes, therefore, are\n\nthe units of inheritance. They\n\ncontain the information that is\n\nrequired to express a particular trait\n\nin an organism. Genes which code\n\nfor a pair of contrasting traits are\n\nknown as alleles, i.e., they are\n\nslightly different forms of the same\n\ngene.\n\nIf we use  alphabetical symbols\n\nfor each gene, then the capital letter\n\nis used for the trait expressed at the\n\nF\n1\n stage and the small alphabet for\n\nthe other trait. For example, in case\n\nof the character of height, T is used\n\nfor the Tall trait and t for the ‘dwarf’,\n\nand T and t are alleles of each other.\n\nHence, in plants the pair of alleles\n\nfor height would be TT, Tt or tt.\n\nMendel also proposed that in a true\n\nbreeding, tall or dwarf pea variety\n\nthe allelic pair of genes for height are\n\nidentical or homozygous, TT and tt, respectively. TT and tt are called\n\nthe genotype of the plant while the descriptive terms tall and dwarf are\n\nthe phenotype. What then would be the phenotype of a plant that had a\n\ngenotype Tt?\n\nAs Mendel found the phenotype of the F\n1 \nheterozygote Tt to be exactly\n\nlike the TT parent in appearance, he proposed that in a pair of dissimilar\n\nfactors, one dominates the other (as in the F\n1 \n) and hence is called the\n\ndominant factor while the other factor is recessive . In this case T (for\n\ntallness) is dominant over t (for dwarfness), that is recessive. He observed\n\nidentical behaviour for all the other characters/trait-pairs that he studied.\n\nIt is convenient (and logical) to use the capital and lower case of an\n\nalphabetical symbol to remember this concept of dominance and\n\nrecessiveness. (Do not use T for tall and d for dwarf because you will\n\nfind it difficult to remember whether T and d are alleles of the same\n\ngene/character or not). Alleles can be similar as in the case of homozygotes\n\nTT and tt or can be dissimilar as in the case of the heterozygote Tt. Since\n\nFigure 5.3 Diagrammatic representation\nof monohybrid cross\n\n\n\n73\n\nPRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE AND VARIATION\n\nthe Tt plant is heterozygous for genes controlling\n\none character (height), it is a monohybrid and the\n\ncross between TT and tt is a monohybrid cross.\n\nFrom the observation that the recessive parental\n\ntrait is expressed without any blending in the F\n2\n\ngeneration, we can infer that, when the tall and\n\ndwarf plant produce gametes, by the process of\n\nmeiosis, the alleles of the parental pair separate or\n\nsegregate from each other and only one allele is\n\ntransmitted to a gamete. This segregation of alleles\n\nis a random process and so there is a 50 per cent\n\nchance of a gamete containing either allele, as has\n\nbeen verified by the results of the crossings. In this\n\nway the gametes of the tall TT plants have the allele\n\nT and the gametes of the dwarf tt plants have the\n\nallele t. During fertilisation the two alleles, T from\n\none parent say, through the pollen, and t from the\n\nother parent, then through the egg, are united to\n\nproduce zygotes that have one T allele and one t\n\nallele.  In other words the hybrids have Tt. Since\n\nthese hybrids contain alleles which express\n\ncontrasting traits, the plants are heterozygous. The\n\nproduction of gametes by the parents, the formation\n\nof the zygotes, the F\n1\n and F\n\n2\n plants can be\n\nunderstood from a diagram called Punnett Square\n\nas shown in Figure 5.4. It was developed by a British\n\ngeneticist, Reginald C. Punnett. It is a graphical\n\nrepresentation to calculate the probability of all\n\npossible genotypes of offspring in a genetic cross.\n\nThe possible gametes are written on two sides,\n\nusually the top row and left columns. All  possible\n\ncombinations are represented in boxes below in the\n\nsquares, which generates a square output form.\n\nThe Punnett Square shows the parental tall TT\n\n(male) and dwarf tt (female) plants, the gametes\n\nproduced by them and, the F\n1\n Tt  progeny. The F\n\n1\n\nplants of genotype Tt are self-pollinated. The\n\nsymbols &&&&& and %%%%% are used to denote the female\n\n(eggs) and male (pollen) of the F\n1 \ngeneration, respectively. The F\n\n1\n plant of\n\nthe genotype Tt when self-pollinated, produces gametes of the genotype\n\nT and t in equal proportion. When fertilisation takes place, the pollen\n\ngrains of genotype T have a 50 per cent chance to pollinate eggs of the\n\ngenotype T, as well as of genotype t. Also pollen grains of genotype t have\n\na 50 per cent chance of pollinating eggs of genotype T, as well as of\n\nFigure 5.4 A Punnett square used to\nunderstand a typical monohybrid\ncross conducted by Mendel\nbetween true-breeding tall plants\nand true-breeding dwarf plants\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n74\n\nBIOLOGY\n\ngenotype t. As a result of random fertilisation, the resultant zygotes can\n\nbe of the genotypes TT, Tt or tt.\n\nFrom the Punnett square it is easily seen that 1/4th of the random\n\nfertilisations lead to TT, 1/2 lead to Tt and 1/4th to tt. Though the F\n1\n\nhave a genotype of Tt, but the phenotypic  character seen is ‘tall’. At F\n2\n,\n\n3/4th of the plants are tall, where some of them are TT while others are\nTt. Externally it is not possible to distinguish between  the plants with\n\nthe genotypes TT and Tt. Hence, within the genopytic pair Tt only one\n\ncharacter ‘T ’ tall is expressed. Hence the character T or ‘tall’ is said to\n\ndominate over the other allele t or ‘dwarf’ character. It is thus due to this\n\ndominance of one character over the other that all the F\n1\n are tall (though\n\nthe genotype is Tt) and in the F\n2\n 3/4th of the plants are tall (though\n\ngenotypically 1/2  are Tt and only 1/4th are TT).  This leads to a phenotypic\n\nratio of 3/4th tall : (1/4 TT + 1/2 Tt) and 1/4th tt, i.e., a 3:1 ratio,  but a\n\ngenotypic ratio of 1:2:1.\n\nThe 1/4 : 1/2 : 1/4 ratio of TT: Tt: tt is mathematically condensable\n\nto the form of the binomial expression (ax +by)2, that has the gametes\n\nbearing genes T or t in equal frequency of ½. The expression is expanded\n\nas given below :\n\n(1/2T + 1/2 t)2  = (1/2T + 1/2t) X (1/2T + 1/2t) = 1/4 TT + 1/2Tt + 1/4 tt\n\nMendel self-pollinated the F\n2\n plants and found that dwarf F\n\n2\n plants\n\ncontinued to generate dwarf plants in F\n3\n and F\n\n4\n generations. He concluded\n\nthat the genotype of the dwarfs was homozygous – tt. What do you think\n\nhe would have got had he self-pollinated a tall F\n2\n plant?\n\nFrom the preceeding paragraphs it is clear that though the genotypic\n\nratios can be calculated using mathematical probability, by simply looking\n\nat the phenotype of a dominant trait, it  is not possible to know the\n\ngenotypic composition. That is, for example, whether a tall plant from F\n1\n\nor F\n2\n has TT or Tt composition, cannot be predicted. Therefore, to determine\n\nthe genotype of a tall plant at F\n2\n, Mendel crossed the tall plant from F\n\n2\n\nwith a dwarf plant. This he called a test cross. In a typical test cross an\n\norganism (pea plants here) showing a dominant phenotype (and whose\n\ngenotype is to be determined) is crossed with the recessive parent instead\n\nof self-crossing. The progenies of such a cross can easily be analysed to\n\npredict the genotype of the test organism. Figure 5.5 shows the results of\n\ntypical test cross where violet colour flower (W) is dominant over white\n\ncolour flower (w).\n\nUsing Punnett square, try to find out the nature of offspring of a test cross.\n\nWhat ratio did you get?\n\nUsing the genotypes of this cross, can you give a general definition for\n\na test cross?\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n75\n\nPRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE AND VARIATION\n\nFigure 5.5 Diagrammatic representation of a test cross\n\nBased on his observations on monohybrid crosses Mendel proposed\n\ntwo general rules to consolidate his understanding of inheritance in\n\nmonohybrid crosses. Today these rules are called the Principles or\n\nLaws of Inheritance: the First Law or Law of Dominance and the\n\nSecond Law or Law of Segregation.\n\n5.2.1 Law of Dominance\n\n(i) Characters are controlled by discrete units called factors.\n\n(ii) Factors occur in pairs.\n\n(iii) In a dissimilar pair of factors one member of the pair dominates\n\n(dominant) the other (recessive).\n\nThe law of dominance is used to explain the expression of only one of\n\nthe parental characters in a monohybrid cross in the F\n1\n and the expression\n\nof both in the F\n2\n. It also explains the proportion of 3:1 obtained at the F\n\n2\n.\n\n5.2.2 Law of Segregation\n\nThis law is based on the fact that the alleles do not show any blending\n\nand that both the characters are recovered as such in the F\n2\n generation\n\nthough one of these is not seen at the F\n1\n stage. Though the parents contain\n\ntwo alleles during gamete formation, the factors or alleles of a pair segregate\n\nfrom each other such that a gamete receives only one of the two factors.\n\nOf course, a homozygous parent produces all gametes that are similar\n\nwhile a heterozygous one produces two kinds of gametes each having\n\none allele with equal proportion.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n76\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n5.2.2.1 Incomplete Dominance\n\nWhen experiments on peas were repeated using other\n\ntraits in other plants, it was found that sometimes\n\nthe F\n1\n had a phenotype that did not resemble either\n\nof the two parents and was in between the two.  The\n\ninheritance of flower colour in the dog flower\n\n(snapdragon or Antirrhinum sp.) is a good example\n\nto understand incomplete dominance. In a cross\n\nbetween true-breeding red-flowered (RR) and true-\n\nbreeding white-flowered plants (rr),  the F\n1\n (Rr) was\n\npink (Figure 5.6).  When the F\n1\n  was self-pollinated\n\nthe F\n2\n  resulted in the following ratio 1 (RR) Red : 2\n\n(Rr) Pink: 1 (rr) White. Here the genotype ratios were\n\nexactly as we would expect in any mendelian\n\nmonohybrid cross, but the phenotype ratios had\n\nchanged from the 3:1 dominant : recessive ratio.\n\nWhat happened was that R was not completely\n\ndominant over r and this  made it possible to\n\ndistinguish Rr as pink from  RR (red)  and rr (white) .\n\nExplanation of the concept of dominance:\n\nWhat exactly is dominance? Why are some alleles\n\ndominant and some recessive? To tackle these\n\nquestions, we must understand what a gene does.\n\nEvery gene, as you know by now, contains the\n\ninformation to express a particular trait. In a\n\ndiploid organism, there are two copies of each\n\ngene, i.e., as a pair of alleles. Now, these two alleles\n\nneed not always be identical, as in a heterozygote.\n\nOne of them may be different due to some changes\n\nthat it has undergone (about which you will read\n\nfurther on, and in the next chapter) which modifies\n\nthe information that particular allele contains.\n\nLet’s take an example of a gene that contains\n\nthe information for producing an enzyme. Now\n\nthere are two copies of this gene, the two allelic\n\nforms. Let us assume (as is more common) that\n\nthe normal allele produces the normal enzyme\n\nthat is needed for the transformation of a\n\nsubstrate S. Theoretically, the modified allele could be responsible for\n\nproduction of –\n\n(i) the normal/less efficient enzyme, or\n\n(ii) a non-functional enzyme, or\n\n(iii) no enzyme at all\n\nFigure 5.6 Results of monohybrid cross in\nthe plant Snapdragon, where\none allele is incompletely\ndominant over the other allele\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n77\n\nPRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE AND VARIATION\n\nIn the first case, the modified allele is equivalent to the unmodified allele,\n\ni.e., it will produce the same phenotype/trait, i.e., result in the transformation\n\nof substrate S. Such equivalent allele pairs are very common. But, if the\n\nallele produces a non-functional enzyme or no enzyme, the phenotype may\n\nbe effected. The phenotype/trait will only be dependent on the functioning\n\nof the unmodified allele. The unmodified (functioning) allele, which represents\n\nthe original phenotype is the dominant allele and the modified allele is\n\ngenerally the recessive allele. Hence, in the example above the recessive trait\n\nis seen due to non-functional enzyme or because no enzyme is produced.\n\n5.2.2.2 Co-dominance\n\nTill now we were discussing crosses where the F\n1\n resembled either of the\n\ntwo parents (dominance) or was in-between (incomplete dominance). But,\n\nin the case of co-dominance the F\n1\n generation resembles both parents. A\n\ngood example is different types of red blood cells that determine ABO\n\nblood grouping in human beings. ABO blood groups are controlled by\n\nthe gene I.  The plasma membrane of the red blood cells has sugar polymers\n\nthat protrude from its surface and the kind of sugar is controlled by the\n\ngene. The gene (I) has three alleles IA, IB and i. The alleles IA and IB produce\n\na slightly different form of the sugar while allele i does not produce any\n\nsugar. Because humans are diploid organisms, each person possesses\n\nany two of the three I gene alleles. IA and IB are completely dominant over\n\ni, in other words when IA and i are present only IA expresses (because  i\n\ndoes not produce any sugar), and when IB and i are present IB expresses.\n\nBut when IA and IB are present together they both express their own types\n\nof sugars: this is because of co-dominance. Hence red blood cells have\n\nboth A and B types of sugars. Since there are three different alleles, there\n\nare six different combinations of these three alleles that are possible, and\n\ntherefore, a total of six different genotypes of the human ABO blood types\n\n(Table 5.2). How many phenotypes are possible?\n\nTable 5.2: Table Showing the Genetic Basis of Blood Groups\n\nin Human Population\n\nAllele from Allele from Genotype of Blood\nParent 1 Parent 2 offspring types of\n\noffspring\n\nI A I A I A I A A\n\nI A I B I A I B AB\n\nI A i I A i A\n\nI B I A I A I B AB\n\nI B I B I B I B B\n\nI B i I B i B\n\ni i i i O\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n78\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nDo you realise that the example of ABO blood grouping also provides\n\na good example of multiple alleles? Here you  can see that there are\n\nmore than two, i.e.,  three alleles, governing the same character. Since in\n\nan individual only two alleles can be present, multiple alleles can be found\n\nonly when population studies are made.\n\nOccasionally, a single gene product may produce more than one effect.\n\nFor example, starch synthesis in pea seeds is controlled by one gene. It\n\nhas two alleles (B and b). Starch is synthesised effectively by BB\n\nhomozygotes and therefore, large starch grains are produced. In contrast,\n\nbb homozygotes have lesser efficiency in starch synthesis and produce\n\nsmaller starch grains. After maturation of the seeds, BB seeds are round\n\nand the bb seeds are wrinkled. Heterozygotes produce round seeds, and\n\nso B seems to be the dominant allele. But, the starch grains produced are\n\nof intermediate size in Bb seeds. So if starch grain size is considered as\n\nthe phenotype, then from this angle, the alleles show incomplete\n\ndominance.\n\nTherefore, dominance is not an autonomous feature of a gene or the\n\nproduct that it has information for. It depends as much on the gene\n\nproduct and the production of a particular phenotype from this product\n\nas it does on the particular phenotype that we choose to examine, in case\n\nmore than one phenotype is influenced by the same gene.\n\n5.3 INHERITANCE OF TWO GENES\n\nMendel also worked with and crossed pea plants that differed in two\n\ncharacters, as is seen in the cross between a pea plant that has seeds with\n\nyellow colour and round shape and one that had seeds of green colour\n\nand wrinkled shape (Figure5.7). Mendel found that the seeds resulting\n\nfrom the crossing of the parents, had yellow coloured and round shaped\n\nseeds. Here can you tell which of the characters in the pairs yellow/\n\ngreen colour and round/wrinkled shape was dominant?\n\nThus, yellow colour was dominant over green and round shape\n\ndominant over wrinkled. These results were identical to those that he got\n\nwhen he made separate monohybrid crosses between yellow and  green\n\nseeded plants and between round and wrinkled seeded plants.\n\nLet us use the genotypic symbols Y for dominant yellow seed colour\n\nand y for recessive green seed colour, R for round shaped seeds and r  for\n\nwrinkled seed shape. The genotype of the parents can then be written as\n\nRRYY and  rryy. The cross between the two plants can be written down\n\nas in Figure 5.7 showing the genotypes of the parent plants. The gametes\n\nRY and ry unite on fertilisation to produce the F\n1\n hybrid RrYy. When\n\nMendel self hybridised  the F\n1\n plants he found that 3/4th of F\n\n2\n plants had\n\nyellow seeds and 1/4th had green. The yellow and green colour segregated\n\nin a 3:1 ratio. Round and wrinkled seed shape also segregated in a 3:1\n\nratio; just like in a monohybrid cross.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n79\n\nPRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE AND VARIATION\n\nFigure 5.7 Results of a dihybrid cross where the two parents differed in two pairs of\ncontrasting traits: seed colour and seed shape\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n80\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n5.3.1 Law of Independent Assortment\n\nIn the dihybrid cross (Figure 5.7), the phenotypes round,yellow;\n\nwrinkled, yellow; round, green  and wrinkled, green appeared in the\n\nratio 9:3:3:1. Such a ratio was observed for several pairs of characters\n\nthat Mendel studied.\n\nThe ratio of 9:3:3:1 can be derived as a combination series of 3 yellow:\n\n1 green, with 3 round : 1 wrinkled. This derivation can be written\n\nas follows:\n\n(3 Round : 1 Wrinkled)  (3 Yellow : 1 Green) = 9 Round, Yellow : 3\n\nWrinkled, Yellow: 3 Round, Green : 1 Wrinkled, Green\n\nBased upon such observations on dihybrid crosses (crosses between\n\nplants differing in two traits) Mendel proposed a second set of generalisations\n\nthat we call Mendel’s Law of Independent Assortment. The law states that\n\n‘when two pairs of traits are combined in a hybrid, segregation of one pair\n\nof characters is independent of the other pair of characters’.\n\nThe Punnett square can be effectively used to understand the\n\nindependent segregation of the two pairs of genes during meiosis and\n\nthe production of eggs and pollen in the F\n1\n RrYy plant. Consider the\n\nsegregation of one pair of genes R and r. Fifty per cent of the gametes\n\nhave the gene R and the other 50 per cent have r. Now besides each\n\ngamete having either R or r, it should also have the allele Y or y.  The\n\nimportant thing to remember here is that segregation of 50 per cent R\n\nand 50 per cent r is independent from the segregation of 50 per cent\n\nY and 50 per cent y. Therefore, 50 per cent of the r bearing gametes\n\nhas Y and the other 50 per cent has y. Similarly, 50 per cent of the R\n\nbearing gametes has Y and the other 50 per cent has y. Thus there are\n\nfour genotypes of gametes (four types of pollen and four types of eggs).\n\nThe four types are  RY, Ry, rY and ry each with a frequency of 25 per\n\ncent or 1/4th of the total gametes produced. When you write down the\n\nfour types of eggs and pollen on the two sides of a Punnett square it is\n\nvery easy to derive the composition of the zygotes  that give rise to the\n\nF\n2 \n\nplants  (Figure 5.7). Although there are 16 squares how many\n\ndifferent types of genotypes and phenotypes are formed? Note them\n\ndown in the format given.\n\nCan you, using the Punnett square data work out the genotypic ratio\n\nat the F\n2\n stage and fill in the format given? Is the genotypic ratio\n\nalso 9:3:3:1?\n\nS.No. Genotypes found in F\n2\n\nTheir expected Phenotypes\n\n5.3.2 Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance\n\nMendel published his work on inheritance of characters in 1865\n\nbut for several reasons, it remained unrecognised till 1900. Firstly,\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n81\n\nPRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE AND VARIATION\n\ncommunication was not easy (as it is now) in those days and his work\n\ncould not be widely publicised.  Secondly, his concept of genes (or\n\nfactors, in Mendel’s words) as stable and discrete units that controlled\n\nthe expression of traits and, of the pair of alleles which did not ‘blend’\n\nwith each other, was not accepted by his contemporaries as an\n\nexplanation for the apparently continuous variation seen in nature.\n\nThirdly, Mendel’s approach of using mathematics to explain biological\n\nphenomena was totally new and unacceptable to many of the\n\nbiologists of his time. Finally, though Mendel’s work suggested that\n\nfactors (genes) were discrete units, he could not provide any physical\n\nproof for the existence of factors or say what they were made of.\n\nIn 1900, three Scientists (de Vries, Correns and von Tschermak)\n\nindependently rediscovered Mendel’s results on the inheritance of\n\ncharacters. Also, by this time due to advancements in microscopy that\n\nwere taking place, scientists were able to carefully observe cell division.\n\nThis led to the discovery of structures in the nucleus that appeared to\n\ndouble and divide just before each cell division. These were called\n\nchromosomes (colored bodies, as they were visualised by staining). By\n\n1902, the chromosome movement during meiosis had been worked out.\n\nWalter Sutton and Theodore Boveri noted that the behaviour of\n\nchromosomes was parallel to the behaviour of genes and used\n\nchromosome movement (Figure 5.8) to explain Mendel’s laws (Table 5.3).\n\nRecall that you have studied the behaviour of chromosomes during mitosis\n\n(equational division) and during meiosis (reduction division). The\n\nimportant things to remember are that chromosomes as well as genes\n\noccur in pairs. The two alleles of a gene pair are located on homologous\n\nsites on homologous chromosomes.\n\nFigure 5.8 Meiosis and germ cell formation in a cell with four chromosomes.\nCan you see how chromosomes segregate when germ cells\nare formed?\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n82\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nPossibility I   Possibility II\nOne long orange and short green          One long orange and short red\nchromosome and long yellow and       chromosome and long yellow and\n short red chromosome at the               short green chromosome at the\n\n               same pole                                              same pole\n\nFigure 5.9 Independent assortment of chromosomes\n\nCan you tell which of these columns A or B represent the chromosome\n\nand which represents the gene? How did you decide?\n\nDuring Anaphase of meiosis I, the two chromosome pairs can align at\n\nthe metaphase plate independently of each other (Figure 5.9). To\n\nunderstand this, compare the chromosomes of four different colour in\n\nthe left and right columns. In the left column (Possibility I) orange and\n\ngreen is segregating together. But in the right hand column (Possibility\n\nII) the orange chromosome is segregating with the red chromosomes.\n\nTable 5.3: A Comparison between the Behaviour of Chromosomes\n\nand Genes\n\nA\n\nOccur in pairs\n\nSegregate at the time of gamete\n\nformation such that only one of each\n\npair is transmitted to a gamete\n\nIndependent pairs segregate\n\nindependently of each other\n\nB\n\nOccur in pairs\n\nSegregate at gamete formation and only\n\none of each pair is transmitted to a\n\ngamete\n\nOne pair segregates independently of\n\nanother pair\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n83\n\nPRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE AND VARIATION\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 5.10 Drosophila\nmelanogaster (a) Male\n\n(b) Female\n\nSutton and Boveri argued that the pairing and separation of a\n\npair of chromosomes would lead to the segregation of a pair of\n\nfactors they carried. Sutton united the knowledge of chromosomal\n\nsegregation with Mendelian principles and called it the\n\nchromosomal theory of inheritance.\n\nFollowing this synthesis of ideas, experimental verification of\n\nthe chromosomal theory of inheritance by Thomas Hunt Morgan\n\nand his colleagues, led to discovering the basis for the variation\n\nthat sexual reproduction produced. Morgan worked with the tiny\n\nfruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster (Figure 5.10), which were\n\nfound very suitable for such studies. They could be grown on\n\nsimple synthetic medium in the laboratory. They complete their life\n\ncycle in about two weeks, and a single mating could produce a large\n\nnumber of progeny flies. Also, there was a clear differentiation of the\n\nsexes – the male and female flies are easily distinguishable. Also, it\n\nhas many types of hereditary variations that can be seen with low\n\npower microscopes.\n\n5.3.3 Linkage and Recombination\n\nMorgan carried out several dihybrid crosses in Drosophila to study genes\n\nthat were sex-linked. The crosses were similar to the dihybrid crosses carried\n\nout by Mendel in peas. For example Morgan hybridised yellow-bodied,\n\nwhite-eyed females to brown-bodied, red-eyed males and intercrossed their\n\nF\n1\n progeny.  He observed that the two genes did not segregate independently\n\nof each other and the F\n2\n ratio deviated very significantly from the 9:3:3:1\n\nratio (expected when the two genes are independent).\n\nMorgan and his group knew that the genes were located on the X\n\nchromosome (Section 5.4) and saw quickly that when the two genes in a\n\ndihybrid cross were situated on the same chromosome, the proportion\n\nof parental gene combinations were much higher than the non-parental\n\ntype.  Morgan attributed this due to the physical association or linkage\n\nof the two genes and coined the term linkage to describe this physical\n\nassociation of genes on a chromosome and the term recombination to\n\ndescribe the generation of non-parental gene combinations (Figure 5.11).\n\nMorgan and his group also found that even when genes were grouped\n\non  the same chromosome, some genes were very tightly linked (showed\n\nvery low recombination) (Figure 5.11, Cross A) while others were loosely\n\nlinked (showed higher recombination) (Figure 5.11, Cross B). For\n\nexample he found that the genes white and yellow were very tightly linked\n\nand showed only 1.3 per cent recombination while white and miniature\n\nwing showed 37.2 per cent recombination. His student Alfred\n\nSturtevant used the frequency of recombination between gene pairs\n\non the same chromosome as a measure of the distance between genes\n\nand ‘mapped’ their position on the chromosome. Today genetic maps\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n84\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nFigure 5.11 Linkage: Results of two dihybrid crosses conducted by Morgan.

But if you\n\nlook around you will find that there are many traits which are not so\ndistinct in their occurrence and are spread across a gradient. For example,\nin humans we don’t just have tall or short people as two distinct\n\nalternatives but a whole range of possible heights. Such traits are generally\ncontrolled by three or more genes and are thus called as polygenic traits.\nBesides the involvement of multiple genes polygenic inheritance also takes\n\ninto account the influence of environment. Human skin colour is another\nclassic example for this. In a polygenic trait the phenotype reflects the\ncontribution of each allele, i.e., the effect of each allele is additive. To\n\nunderstand this better let us assume that three genes A, B, C control skin\ncolour in human with the dominant forms A, B and C responsible for\ndark skin colour and the recessive forms a, b and c for light skin colour.\n\nThe genotype with all the dominant alleles (AABBCC) will have the darkest\nskin colour and that with all the recessive alleles (aabbcc) will have the\nlightest skin colour. As expected the genotype with three dominant alleles\n\nand three recessive alleles will have an intermediate skin colour. In this\nmanner the number of each type of alleles in the genotype would determine\nthe darkness or lightness of the skin in an individual.\n\n5.5  PLEIOTROPY\nWe have so far seen the effect of a gene on a single phenotype or trait.\n\nThere are however instances where a single gene can exhibit multiple\nphenotypic expression. Such a gene is called a pleiotropic gene. The\nunderlying mechanism of pleiotropy in most cases is the effect of a gene\n\non metabolic pathways which contribute towards different phenotypes.\nAn example of this is the disease phenylketonuria, which occurs in\nhumans. The disease is caused by mutation in the gene that codes for the\n\nenzyme phenyl alanine hydroxylase (single gene mutation). This manifests\nitself through phenotypic expression characterised by mental\nretardation and a reduction in hair and skin pigmentation.\n\n5.6 SEX DETERMINATION\n\nThe mechanism of sex determination has always been a puzzle before the\ngeneticists. The initial clue about the genetic/chromosomal mechanism\nof sex determination can be traced back to some of the experiments carried\n\nout in insects. In fact, the cytological observations made in a number of\ninsects led to the development of the concept of genetic/chromosomal\nbasis of sex-determination. Henking (1891) could trace a specific nuclear\n\nstructure all through spermatogenesis in a few insects, and it was also\nobserved by him that 50 per  cent of the sperm received this structure\nafter spermatogenesis, whereas the other 50 per cent sperm did not receive\n\nit. Henking gave a name to this structure as the X body but he could not\nexplain its significance. Further investigations by other scientists led to\nthe conclusion that the ‘X body’ of Henking was in fact a chromosome\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n86\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nand that is why it was given the name\nX-chromosome. It was also observed that in\n\na large number of insects the mechanism of\nsex determination is of the XO type, i.e., all\neggs bear an additional X-chromosome\n\nbesides the other chromosomes\n(autosomes). On the other hand, some of the\nsperms bear the X-chromosome whereas\n\nsome do not. Eggs fertilised by sperm having\nan X-chromosome become females and,\nthose fertilised by sperms that do not have\n\nan X-chromosome become males. Do you\nthink the number of chromosomes in the\n\nmale and female are equal? Due to the\n\ninvolvement of the X-chromosome in the\ndetermination of sex, it was designated to\nbe the sex chromosome, and the rest of the\n\nchromosomes were named as\nautosomes.Grasshopper is an example of\nXO type of sex determination in which the\n\nmales have only one X-chromosome besides\nthe autosomes, whereas females have a pair\nof X-chromosomes.\n\nThese observations led to the\n\ninvestigation of a number of species to\n\nunderstand the mechanism of sex\n\ndetermination. In a number of other insects\n\nand mammals including man, XY type of sex\n\ndetermination is seen where both male and\n\nfemale have same number of chromosomes.\n\nAmong the males an X-chromosome is\n\npresent but its counter part is distinctly\n\nsmaller and called the Y-chromosome.\n\nFemales, however, have a pair of X-\n\nchromosomes. Both males and females bear\n\nsame number of autosomes. Hence, the males have autosomes plus XY,\n\nwhile female have autosomes plus XX. In human beings  and in\n\nDrosophila the males have one X and one Y chromosome, whereas females\n\nhave a pair of X-chromosomes besides autosomes (Figure 5.12 a, b).\n\nIn the above description you have studied about two types of sex\n\ndetermining mechanisms, i.e., XO type and XY type. But in both cases\n\nmales produce two different types of gametes, (a) either with or without\n\nX-chromosome or (b) some gametes with X-chromosome and some with\n\nY-chromosome. Such types of sex determination mechanism is designated\n\nto be the example of male heterogamety. In some other organisms, e.g.,\n\nbirds, a different mechanism of sex determination is observed (Figure\n\n5.12 c). In this case the total number of chromosome is same in both\n\nmales and females. But two different types of gametes in terms of the sex\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 5.12 Determination of sex by chromosomal\ndifferences: (a,b) Both in humans and\nin Drosophila, the female has a pair of\nXX chromosomes (homogametic) and the\nmale XY (heterogametic) composition;\n(c) In many birds, female has a pair of\ndissimilar chromosomes ZW and male\ntwo similar ZZ chromosomes\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n87\n\nPRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE AND VARIATION\n\nchromosomes, are produced by females, i.e., female heterogamety. In\n\norder to have a distinction with the mechanism of sex determination\n\ndescribed earlier, the two different sex chromosomes of a female bird has\n\nbeen designated to be the Z and W chromosomes. In these organisms the\n\nfemales have one Z and one W chromosome, whereas males have a pair of\n\nZ-chromosomes besides the autosomes.\n\n5.6.1 Sex Determination in Humans\n\nIt has already been mentioned that the sex determining mechanism in\n\ncase of humans is XY type. Out of 23 pairs of chromosomes present,\n\n22 pairs are exactly same in both males and females; these are the\n\nautosomes. A pair of X-chromosomes are present in the female, whereas\n\nthe presence of an X and Y chromosome are determinant of the male\n\ncharacteristic. During spermatogenesis among males, two types of\n\ngametes are produced. 50 per cent of the total sperm produced carry\n\nthe X-chromosome and the rest 50 per cent has Y-chromosome besides\n\nthe autosomes. Females, however, produce only one type of ovum with\n\nan X-chromosome. There is an equal probability of fertilisation of the\n\novum with the sperm carrying either X or Y chromosome. In case the\n\novum fertilises with a sperm carrying X-chromosome the zygote develops\n\ninto a female (XX) and the fertilisation of ovum with Y-chromosome\n\ncarrying sperm results into a male offspring. Thus, it is evident that it\n\nis the genetic makeup of the sperm that determines the sex of the child.\n\nIt is also evident that in each pregnancy there is always 50 per cent\n\nprobability of either a male or a female child. It is unfortunate that in\n\nour society women are blamed for giving birth to female children and\n\nhave been ostracised and ill-treated because of this false notion.\n\n5.6.2 Sex Determination in Honey Bee\n\nThe sex determination in honey bee is\n\nbased on the number of sets of\n\nchromosomes an individual receives. An\n\noffspring formed from the union of a\n\nsperm and an egg develops as a female\n\n(queen or worker), and an unfertilised\n\negg develops as a male (drone) by means\n\nof parthenogenesis. This means that the\n\nmales have half the number of\n\nchromosomes than that of a female. The\n\nfemales are diploid having 32\n\nchromosomes and males are haploid, i.e., having 16 chromosomes.\n\nThis is called as haplodiploid sex-determination system and has special\n\ncharacteristic features such as the males produce sperms by mitosis\n\n(Figure 5.13), they do not have father and thus cannot have sons, but\n\nhave a grandfather and can have grandsons.\nHow is the sex-determination mechanism different in the birds?\n\nIs the sperm or the egg responsible for the sex of the chicks?\n\nFigure 5.13  Sex determination in honey bee\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n88\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n5.7 MUTATION\n\nMutation is a phenomenon which results in alteration of DNA sequences\n\nand consequently results in changes in the genotype and the phenotype\n\nof an organism. In addition to recombination, mutation is another\n\nphenomenon that leads to variation in DNA.\n\nAs you will learn in Chapter 6, one DNA helix runs continuously from\n\none end to the other in each chromatid, in a highly supercoiled form.\n\nTherefore loss (deletions) or gain (insertion/duplication) of a segment of\n\nDNA, result in alteration in chromosomes. Since genes are known to be\n\nlocated on chromosomes, alteration in chromosomes results in\n\nabnormalities or aberrations. Chromosomal\n\naberrations are commonly observed in cancer cells.\n\nIn addition to the above, mutation also arise due\n\nto change in a single base pair of DNA. This is known\n\nas point mutation. A classical example of such a\n\nmutation is sickle cell anemia. Deletions and insertions\n\nof base pairs of DNA, causes frame-shift mutations\n\n(see Chapter 6).\n\nThe mechanism of mutation is beyond the scope\n\nof this discussion, at this level. However, there are\n\nmany chemical and physical factors that induce\n\nmutations. These are referred to as mutagens. UV\n\nradiations can cause mutations in organisms – it is a\n\nmutagen.\n\n5.8 GENETIC DISORDERS\n\n5.8.1 Pedigree Analysis\n\nThe idea that disorders are inherited has been\n\nprevailing in the human society since long. This was\n\nbased on the heritability of certain characteristic\n\nfeatures in families. After the rediscovery of Mendel’s\n\nwork the practice of analysing inheritance pattern of\n\ntraits in human beings began. Since it is evident that\n\ncontrol crosses that can be performed in pea plant or\n\nsome other organisms, are not possible in case of\n\nhuman beings, study of the family history about\n\ninheritance of a particular trait provides an\n\nalternative. Such an analysis of traits in a several of generations of a family\n\nis called the pedigree analysis. In the pedigree analysis the inheritance\n\nof a particular trait is represented in the family tree over generations.\n\nIn human genetics, pedigree study provides a strong tool, which is\n\nutilised to trace the inheritance of a specific trait, abnormality or disease.\n\nSome of the important standard symbols used in the pedigree analysis\n\nhave been shown in Figure 5.13.\n\nAs you have studied in this chapter, each and every feature in any\n\norganism is controlled by one or the other gene located on the DNA present\n\nFigure 5.13 Symbols used in the human\npedigree analysis\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n89\n\nPRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE AND VARIATION\n\nin the chromosome. DNA is the carrier of genetic information. It is hence\n\ntransmitted from one generation to the other without any change or\n\nalteration. However, changes or alteration do take place occasionally. Such\n\nan alteration or change in the genetic material is referred to as mutation.\n\nA number of disorders in human beings have been found to be associated\n\nwith the inheritance of changed or altered genes or chromosomes.\n\n5.8.2 Mendelian Disorders\n\nBroadly, genetic disorders may be grouped into two categories – Mendelian\n\ndisorders and Chromosomal disorders. Mendelian disorders are mainly\n\ndetermined by alteration or mutation in the single gene. These disorders\n\nare transmitted to the offspring on the same lines as we have studied in\n\nthe principle of inheritance. The pattern of inheritance of such Mendelian\n\ndisorders can be traced in a family by the pedigree analysis. Most common\n\nand prevalent Mendelian disorders are Haemophilia, Cystic fibrosis, Sickle-\n\ncell anaemia, Colour blindness, Phenylketonuria, Thalassemia, etc. It is\n\nimportant to mention here that such Mendelian disorders may be\n\ndominant or recessive. By pedigree analysis one can easily understand\n\nwhether the trait in question is dominant or recessive. Similarly, the trait\n\nmay also be linked to the sex chromosome as in case of haemophilia. It is\n\nevident that this X-linked recessive trait shows transmission from carrier\n\nfemale to male progeny. A representative pedigree is shown in Figure 5.14\n\nfor dominant and recessive traits. Discuss with your teacher and design\n\npedigrees for characters linked to both autosomes and sex chromosome.\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 5.14 Representative pedigree analysis of (a) Autosomal dominant trait (for example:\nMyotonic dystrophy) (b) Autosomal recessive trait (for example: Sickle-cell anaemia)\n\nColour Blidness : It is a sex-linked recessive disorder due to defect in\neither red or green cone of eye resulting in failure to discriminate between\n\nred and green colour.  This defect is due to mutation in certain genes\n\npresent in the X chromosome. It occurs in about 8 per cent of males and\n\nonly about 0.4 per cent of females. This is because the genes that lead to\n\nred-green colour blindness are on the X chromosome. Males have only\n\none X chromosome and females have two. The son of a woman who carries\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n90\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nthe gene has a 50 per cent chance of being colour blind. The mother is\nnot herself colour blind because the gene is recessive. That means that its\neffect is suppressed by her matching dominant normal gene. A daughter\nwill not normally be colour blind, unless her mother is a carrier and her\n\nfather is colour blind.\n\nHaemophilia : This sex linked recessive disease, which shows its\ntransmission from unaffected carrier female to some of the male progeny\nhas been widely studied. In this disease, a single protein that is a part of\nthe cascade of proteins involved in the clotting of blood is affected. Due to\nthis, in an affected individual a simple cut will result in non-stop bleeding.\nThe heterozygous female (carrier) for haemophilia may transmit the disease\nto sons. The possibility of a female becoming a haemophilic is extremely\nrare because mother of such a female has to be at least carrier and the\nfather should be haemophilic (unviable in the later stage of life). The family\npedigree of Queen Victoria shows a number of haemophilic descendents\nas she was a carrier of the disease.\n\nSickle-cell anaemia : This is an autosome linked recessive trait that can\nbe transmitted from parents to the offspring when both the partners are\ncarrier for the gene (or heterozygous). The disease is controlled by a single\npair of allele, HbA and HbS. Out of the three possible genotypes only\nhomozygous individuals for HbS (HbSHbS) show the diseased phenotype.\nHeterozygous (HbAHbS) individuals appear apparently unaffected but they\nare carrier of the disease as there is 50 per cent probability of transmission\nof the mutant gene to the progeny, thus exhibiting sickle-cell trait\n(Figure 5.15). The defect is caused by the substitution of Glutamic acid\n\nFigure 5.15 Micrograph of the red blood cells and the amino acid composition of the relevant\nportion of β-chain of haemoglobin: (a) From a normal individual; (b) From an individual\nwith sickle-cell anaemia\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n91\n\nPRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE AND VARIATION\n\n(Glu) by Valine (Val) at the sixth position of the beta globin chain of the\nhaemoglobin molecule. The substitution of amino acid in the globin\nprotein results due to the single base substitution at the sixth codon of\nthe beta globin gene from GAG to GUG. The mutant haemoglobin molecule\nundergoes polymerisation under low oxygen tension causing the change\nin the shape of the RBC from biconcave disc to elongated sickle like\nstructure (Figure 5.15).\n\nPhenylketonuria : This inborn error of metabolism is also inherited as\nthe autosomal recessive trait. The affected individual lacks an enzyme\nthat converts the amino acid phenylalanine into tyrosine. As a result of\nthis phenylalanine is accumulated and converted into phenylpyruvic acid\nand other derivatives. Accumulation of these in brain results in mental\nretardation. These are also excreted through urine because of its poor\nabsorption by kidney.\n\nThalassemia : This is also an autosome-linked recessive blood disease\ntransmitted from parents to the offspring when both the partners are\nunaffected carrier for the gene (or heterozygous). The defect could be due\nto either mutation or deletion which ultimately results in reduced rate of\nsynthesis of one of the globin chains (α and β chains) that make up\nhaemoglobin. This causes the formation of abnormal haemoglobin\nmolecules resulting into anaemia which is characteristic of the disease.\nThalassemia can be classified according to which chain of the haemoglobin\nmolecule is affected. In α Thalassemia, production of α globin chain is\naffected while in β Thalassemia, production of β globin chain is affected.\nα Thalassemia is controlled by two closely linked genes HBA1 and HBA2\non chromosome 16 of each parent and it is observed due to mutation or\ndeletion of one or more of the four genes. The more genes affected, the\nless alpha globin molecules produced. While β Thalassemia is controlled\nby a single gene HBB on chromosome 11 of each parent and occurs due\nto mutation of one or both the genes. Thalassemia differs from sickle-cell\nanaemia in that the former is a quantitative problem of synthesising too\nfew globin molecules while the latter is a qualitative problem of\nsynthesising an incorrectly functioning globin.\n\n5.8.3 Chromosomal Disorders\n\nThe chromosomal disorders on the other hand are caused due to absence\nor excess or abnormal arrangement of one or more chromosomes.\n\nFailure of segregation of chromatids during cell division cycle results\nin the gain or loss of a chromosome(s), called aneuploidy. For example,\nDown’s syndrome results in the gain of extra copy of chromosome 21.\nSimilarly, Turner’s syndrome results due to loss of an X chromosome in\nhuman females. Failure of cytokinesis after telophase stage of cell division\nresults in an increase in a whole set of chromosomes in an organism and,\nthis phenomenon is known as polyploidy. This condition is often seen in\nplants.\n\nThe total number of chromosomes in a normal human cell is 46\n(23 pairs). Out of these 22 pairs are autosomes and one pair of\nchromosomes are sex chromosome. Sometimes, though rarely, either an\nadditional copy of a chromosome may be included in an individual or an\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n92\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nFlat back of head\n\nMany “loops” on\nfinger tips\n\nPalm crease\n\nBroad flat face\n\nBig and wrinkled\ntongue\n\nCongenital heart\ndisease\n\nindividual may lack one of any one pair of\nchromosomes. These situations are known as trisomy\nor monosomy of a chromosome, respectively. Such a\nsituation leads to very serious consequences in the\nindividual. Down’s syndrome, Turner’s syndrome,\nKlinefelter’s syndrome are common examples of\nchromosomal disorders.\n\nDown’s Syndrome : The cause of this genetic disorder\nis the presence of an additional copy of the\nchromosome number 21 (trisomy of 21). This disorder\nwas first described by Langdon Down (1866). The\naffected individual is short statured with small round\nhead, furrowed tongue and partially open mouth\n(Figure 5.16). Palm is broad with characteristic palm\ncrease. Physical, psychomotor and mental\n\ndevelopment is retarded.\n\nKlinefelter’s Syndrome : This genetic disorder is also\n\ncaused due to the presence of an additional copy of X-\nchromosome resulting into a karyotype of 47, XXY.\nSuch an individual has overall masculine development,\nhowever, the feminine development (development\nof breast, i.e., Gynaecomastia) is also expressed\n(Figure 5.17 a). Such individuals are sterile.\n\nTurner’s Syndrome : Such a disorder is caused due\n\nto the absence of one of the X chromosomes, i.e., 45 with  X0, Such females\n\nare sterile as ovaries are rudimentary besides other features including\n\nlack of other secondary sexual characters (Figure 5.17 b).\n\nFigure 5.16 A representative figure showing an individual inflicted with Down’s\nsyndrome and the corresponding chromosomes of the individual\n\nTall stature\nwith feminised\n\ncharacter\n\nShort stature and\nunderdeveloped\n\nfeminine character\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 5.17 Diagrammatic represe-\nntation of genetic disorders due to sex\nchromosome composition in humans :\n(a) Klinefelter Syndrome; (b) Turner’s\nSyndrome\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n93\n\nPRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE AND VARIATION\n\nSUMMARY\n\nGenetics is a branch of biology which deals with principles of inheritance\nand its practices. Progeny resembling the parents in morphological and\nphysiological features has attracted the attention of many biologists.\nMendel was the first to study this phenomenon systematically. While\nstudying the pattern of inheritance in pea plants of contrasting\ncharacters, Mendel proposed the principles of inheritance, which are\ntoday referred to as ‘Mendel’s Laws of Inheritance’. He proposed that\nthe ‘factors’ (later named as genes) regulating the characters are found\nin pairs known as alleles. He observed that the expression of the\ncharacters in the offspring follow a definite pattern in different–first\ngenerations (F\n\n1\n), second (F\n\n2\n) and so on. Some characters are dominant\n\nover others. The dominant characters are expressed when factors are\nin heterozygous condition (Law of Dominance). The recessive characters\nare only expressed in homozygous conditions. The characters never\nblend in heterozygous condition. A recessive character that was not\nexpressed in heterozygous conditon may be expressed again when it\nbecomes homozygous. Hence, characters segregate while formation of\ngametes (Law of Segregation).\n\nNot all characters show true dominance. Some characters show\nincomplete, and some show co-dominance. When Mendel studied the\ninheritance of two characters together, it was found that the factors\nindependently assort and combine in all permutations and\ncombinations (Law of Independent Assortment). Different combinations\nof gametes are theoretically represented in a square tabular form known\nas ‘Punnett Square’.  The factors (now known as gene) on chromosomes\nregulating the characters are called the genotype and the physical\nexpression of the chraracters is called phenotype.\n\nAfter knowing that the genes are located on the chromosomes, a\ngood correlation was drawn between Mendel’s laws : segregation and\nassortment of chromosomes during meiosis. The Mendel’s laws were\nextended in the form of ‘Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance’. Later, it\nwas found that Mendel’s law of independent assortment does not hold\ntrue for the genes that were located on the same chromosomes. These\ngenes were called as ‘linked genes’. Closely located genes assorted\ntogether, and distantly located genes, due to recombination, assorted\nindependently. Linkage maps, therefore, corresponded to arrangement\nof genes on a chromosome.\n\nMany genes were linked to sexes also, and called as sex-linked\ngenes. The two sexes (male and female) were found to have a set of\nchromosomes which were common, and another set which was\ndifferent. The chromosomes which were different in two sexes were\nnamed as sex chromosomes. The remaining set was named as\nautosomes. In humans, a normal female has 22 pairs of autosomes\nand a pair of sex chromosomes (XX). A male has 22 pairs of autosomes\nand a pair of sex chromosome as XY. In chicken, sex chromosomes in\nmale are ZZ, and in females are ZW.\n\nMutation is defined as change in the genetic material. A point\nmutation is a change of a single base pair in DNA. Sickle-cell anemia is\ncaused due to change of one base in the gene coding for beta-chain of\nhemoglobin. Inheritable mutations can be studied by generating a\npedigree of a family. Some mutations involve changes in whole set of\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n94\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nEXERCISES\n1. Mention the advantages of selecting pea plant for experiment by Mendel.\n\n2.

Who had proposed the chromosomal theory of the inheritance?\n\n16. Mention any two autosomal genetic disorders with their symptoms.\n\nchromosomes (polyploidy) or change in a subset of chromosome number\n(aneuploidy). This helped in understanding the mutational basis of\ngenetic disorders. Down’s syndrome is due to trisomy of chromosome 21,\nwhere there is an extra copy of chromosome 21 and consequently the\ntotal number of chromosome becomes 47. In Turner’s syndrome, one X\nchromosome is missing and the sex chromosome is as XO, and in\nKlinefelter’s syndrome, the condition is XXY. These can be easily studied\nby analysis of Karyotypes.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\tChapter-5 1\n\tChapter-5 2\n\tChapter-5 3\n\tChapter-5 4\n\tChapter-5 5\n\tChapter-5 6\n\tChapter-5 7\n\tChapter-5 8\n\tChapter-5 9\n\tChapter-5 10\n\tChapter-5 11\n\tChapter-5 12\n\tChapter-5 13\n\tChapter-5 14\n\tChapter-5 15\n\tChapter-5 16\n\tChapter-5 17\n\tChapter-5 18\n\tChapter-5 19\n\tChapter-5 20\n\tChapter-5 21\n\tChapter-5 22\n\tChapter-5 23\n\tChapter-5 24\n\tChapter-5 25\n\tChapter-5 26\n\tChapter-5 27\n\tChapter-5 28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMolecular Basis of Inhertance.pmd\n\n\nCHAPTER 6\n\nMOLECULAR BASIS OF\n\nINHERITANCE\n\n6.1 The DNA\n\n6.2 The Search for Genetic\n\nMaterial\n\n6.3 RNA World\n\n6.4 Replication\n\n6.5 Transcription\n\n6.6 Genetic Code\n\n6.7 Translation\n\n6.8 Regulation of Gene\n\nExpression\n\n6.9 Human Genome Project\n\n6.10 DNA Fingerprinting\n\nIn the previous chapter, you have learnt the inheritance\n\npatterns and the genetic basis of such patterns. At the\n\ntime of Mendel, the nature of those ‘factors’ regulating\n\nthe pattern of inheritance was not clear. Over the next\n\nhundred years, the nature of the putative genetic material\n\nwas investigated culminating in the realisation that\n\nDNA – deoxyribonucleic acid – is the genetic material, at\n\nleast for the majority of organisms. In class XI you have\n\nlearnt that nucleic acids are polymers of nucleotides.\n\nDeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid\n\n(RNA) are the two types of nucleic acids found in living\n\nsystems. DNA acts as the genetic material in most of the\n\norganisms. RNA though it also acts as a genetic material\n\nin some viruses, mostly functions as a messenger. RNA\n\nhas additional roles as well. It functions as adapter,\n\nstructural, and in some cases as a catalytic molecule. In\n\nClass XI you have already learnt the structures of\n\nnucleotides and the way these monomer units are linked\n\nto form nucleic acid polymers. In this chapter we are going\n\nto discuss the structure of DNA, its replication, the process\n\nof making RNA from DNA (transcription), the genetic code\n\nthat determines the sequences of amino acids in proteins,\n\nthe process of protein synthesis (translation) and\n\nelementary basis of their regulation. The determination\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n96\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nof complete nucleotide sequence of human genome during last decade\n\nhas set in a new era of genomics. In the last section, the essentials of\n\nhuman genome sequencing and its consequences will also be discussed.\n\nLet us begin our discussion by first understanding the structure of\n\nthe most interesting molecule in the living system, that is, the DNA. In\n\nsubsequent sections, we will understand that why it is the most abundant\n\ngenetic material, and what its relationship is with RNA.\n\n6.1 THE DNA\n\nDNA is a long polymer of deoxyribonucleotides.  The length of DNA is\n\nusually defined as number of nucleotides (or a pair of nucleotide referred\n\nto as base pairs) present in it.  This also is the characteristic of an organism.\n\nFor example, a bacteriophage known as φφφφφ ×174 has 5386 nucleotides,\n\nBacteriophage lambda has 48502 base pairs (bp), Escherichia coli  has\n\n4.6 × 106 bp, and haploid content of human DNA is 3.3 × 109 bp. Let us\n\ndiscuss the structure of such a long polymer.\n\n6.1.1 Structure of Polynucleotide Chain\n\nLet us recapitulate the chemical structure of a polynucleotide chain (DNA\n\nor RNA). A nucleotide has three components – a nitrogenous base, a\n\npentose sugar (ribose in case of RNA, and deoxyribose for DNA), and a\n\nphosphate group. There are two types of nitrogenous bases – Purines\n\n(Adenine and Guanine), and Pyrimidines (Cytosine, Uracil and Thymine).\n\nCytosine is common for both DNA and RNA and Thymine is present in\n\nDNA. Uracil is  present in RNA at the place of Thymine. A nitrogenous\n\nbase is linked to the OH of 1' C pentose sugar through a N-glycosidic\n\nlinkage to form a nucleoside, such as adenosine or deoxyadenosine,\n\nguanosine or deoxyguanosine, cytidine or deoxycytidine and uridine or\n\ndeoxythymidine.  When a phosphate group is linked to OH of 5' C  of a\n\nnucleoside through phosphoester linkage, a corresponding nucleotide\n\n(or deoxynucleotide depending upon the type of sugar present) is formed.\n\nTwo nucleotides are linked through 3'-5'  phosphodiester linkage to form\n\na dinucleotide.  More nucleotides can be joined in such a manner to form\n\na polynucleotide chain. A polymer thus formed has at one end a free\n\nFigure 6.1 A Polynucleotide chain\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n97\n\nMOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE\n\nphosphate moiety at 5'-end of sugar, which is referred to as 5’-end of\n\npolynucleotide chain. Similarly, at the other end of the polymer the sugar\n\nhas a free OH of 3'C  group which is referred to as 3' -end of the\n\npolynucleotide chain.  The backbone of a polynucleotide chain is formed\n\ndue to sugar and phosphates. The nitrogenous bases linked to sugar\n\nmoiety project from the backbone (Figure 6.1).\n\nIn RNA, every nucleotide residue has an additional –OH group present\n\nat 2'-position in the ribose. Also, in RNA the uracil is found at the place of\n\nthymine (5-methyl uracil, another chemical name for thymine).\n\nDNA  as an acidic substance present in nucleus was first identified by\n\nFriedrich Meischer in 1869. He named it as ‘Nuclein’. However, due to\n\ntechnical limitation in isolating such a long polymer intact, the elucidation\n\nof structure of DNA remained elusive for a very long period of time.  It was\n\nonly in 1953 that James Watson and Francis Crick, based on the X-ray\n\ndiffraction data produced by Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin,\n\nproposed a very simple but famous Double Helix model for the structure\n\nof DNA.  One of the hallmarks of their proposition was base pairing between\n\nthe two strands of polynucleotide chains.  However, this proposition was\n\nalso based on the observation of Erwin Chargaff that for a double stranded\n\nDNA, the ratios between Adenine and Thymine and Guanine and Cytosine\n\nare constant and equals one.\n\nThe base pairing confers a very unique property to the polynucleotide\n\nchains. They are said to be complementary to each other, and therefore if\n\nthe sequence of bases in one strand is known then the sequence in other\n\nstrand can be predicted. Also, if each strand from a DNA (let us call it as a\n\nparental DNA) acts as a template for synthesis of a new strand, the two\n\ndouble stranded DNA (let us call them as daughter DNA) thus, produced\n\nwould be identical to the parental DNA molecule. Because of this, the genetic\n\nimplications of the structure of DNA became very clear.\n\nThe salient features of the Double-helix structure of DNA are as follows:\n\n(i) It is made of two polynucleotide chains, where the backbone is\n\nconstituted by sugar-phosphate, and the bases project inside.\n\n(ii) The two chains have anti-parallel polarity. It means, if one\n\nchain has the polarity 5'à3' , the other has 3'à5 ' .\n\n(iii) The bases in two strands are paired through hydrogen bond\n\n(H-bonds) forming base pairs (bp). Adenine forms two hydrogen\n\nbonds with Thymine from opposite strand and vice-versa.\n\nSimilarly, Guanine is bonded with Cytosine with three H-bonds.\n\nAs a result, always a purine comes opposite to a pyrimidine. This\n\ngenerates approximately uniform distance between the two\n\nstrands of the helix (Figure 6.2).\n\n(iv) The two chains are coiled in a right-handed fashion. The pitch\n\nof the helix is 3.4 nm (a nanometre is one billionth of a\n\nmetre, that is 10-9 m) and there are roughly 10 bp in each\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n98\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nFigure 6.2 Double stranded polynucleotide chain\n\n Figure 6.3 DNA double helix\n\nturn. Consequently, the distance\n\nbetween a bp in a helix is\n\napproximately 0.34 nm.\n\n(v) The plane of one base pair stacks\n\nover the other in double helix. This,\n\nin addition to H-bonds, confers\n\nstability of the helical structure\n\n(Figure 6.3).\n\n Compare the structure of purines and\n\npyrimidines. Can you find out why the\n\ndistance between two polynucleotide\n\nchains in DNA remains almost constant?\n\nThe proposition of a double helix\n\nstructure for DNA and its simplicity in\n\nexplaining the genetic implication became\n\nrevolutionary. Very soon, Francis Crick\n\nproposed the Central dogma in molecular\n\nbiology, which states that the genetic\n\ninformation flows from DNAàRNAàProtein.\n\nCentral dogma\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n99\n\nMOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE\n\nFigure 6.4a Nucleosome\n\nFigure 6.4b EM picture - ‘Beads-on-String’\n\nIn some viruses the flow of information is in reverse direction, that is,\n\nfrom RNA to DNA. Can you suggest a simple name to the process?\n\n6.1.2  Packaging of DNA Helix\n\nTaken the distance between two consecutive base pairs\n\nas 0.34 nm (0.34×10–9 m), if the length of DNA double\n\nhelix in a typical mammalian cell is calculated (simply\n\nby multiplying the total number of bp with distance\n\nbetween two consecutive bp, that is, 6.6 × 109 bp ×\n\n0.34 × 10-9m/bp), it comes out to be approximately\n\n2.2 metres. A length that is far greater than the\n\ndimension of a typical nucleus (approximately 10–6 m).\n\nHow is such a long polymer packaged in a cell?\n\nIf the length of E. coli DNA is 1.36 mm, can you\n\ncalculate the number of base pairs in E.coli?\n\nIn prokaryotes, such as, E. coli, though they do\n\nnot have a defined nucleus, the DNA is not scattered\n\nthroughout the cell.  DNA (being negatively charged)\n\nis held with some proteins (that have positive\n\ncharges) in a region termed as ‘nucleoid’.  The DNA\n\nin nucleoid is organised in large loops held by\n\nproteins.\n\nIn eukaryotes, this organisation is much more\n\ncomplex.  There is a set of positively charged, basic\n\nproteins called histones.  A protein acquires charge\n\ndepending upon the abundance of amino acids\n\nresidues with charged side chains. Histones are rich\n\nin the basic amino acid residues lysine and arginine.\n\nBoth the amino acid residues carry positive charges\n\nin their side chains. Histones are organised to form\n\na unit of eight molecules called histone octamer.\n\nThe negatively charged DNA is wrapped around the positively charged\n\nhistone octamer to form a structure called nucleosome (Figure 6.4 a). A\n\ntypical nucleosome contains 200 bp of DNA helix.  Nucleosomes constitute\n\nthe repeating unit of a structure in nucleus called chromatin, thread-\n\nlike stained (coloured) bodies seen in nucleus. The nucleosomes in\n\nchromatin are seen as ‘beads-on-string’ structure when viewed under\n\nelectron microscope (EM) (Figure 6.4 b).\n\nTheoretically, how many such beads (nucleosomes) do you imagine\n\nare present in a mammalian cell?\n\nThe beads-on-string structure in chromatin is packaged to form\n\nchromatin fibers that are further coiled and condensed at metaphase stage\n\nof cell division to form chromosomes. The packaging of chromatin at higher\n\nlevel requires additional set of proteins that collectively are referred to as\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n100\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nNon-histone Chromosomal (NHC) proteins.  In a typical nucleus, some\n\nregion of chromatin are loosely packed (and stains light) and are referred to\n\nas euchromatin. The chromatin that is more densely packed and stains\n\ndark are called as Heterochromatin.  Euchromatin is said to be\n\ntranscriptionally active chromatin, whereas heterochromatin is inactive.\n\n6.2 THE SEARCH FOR GENETIC MATERIAL\n\nEven though the discovery of nuclein by Meischer and the proposition\n\nfor principles of inheritance by Mendel were almost at the same time, but\n\nthat the DNA acts as a genetic material took long to be discovered and\n\nproven. By 1926, the quest to determine the mechanism for genetic\n\ninheritance had reached the molecular level. Previous discoveries by\n\nGregor Mendel, Walter Sutton, Thomas Hunt Morgan and numerous other\n\nscientists had narrowed the search to the chromosomes located in the\n\nnucleus of most cells. But the question of what molecule was actually the\n\ngenetic material, had not been answered.\n\nTransforming Principle\n\nIn 1928, Frederick Griffith, in a series of experiments with Streptococcus\n\npneumoniae (bacterium responsible for pneumonia), witnessed a\n\nmiraculous transformation in the bacteria. During the course of his\n\nexperiment, a living organism (bacteria) had changed in physical form.\n\nWhen Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) bacteria are grown\n\non a culture plate, some produce smooth shiny colonies (S) while others\n\nproduce rough colonies (R). This is because the S strain bacteria have a\n\nmucous (polysaccharide) coat, while R strain does not. Mice infected with\n\nthe S strain (virulent) die from pneumonia infection but mice infected\n\nwith the R strain do not develop pneumonia.\n\nGriffith was able to kill bacteria by heating them. He observed that\n\nheat-killed S strain bacteria injected into mice did not kill them. When he\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n101\n\nMOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE\n\ninjected a mixture of heat-killed S and live R bacteria, the mice died.\n\nMoreover, he recovered living S bacteria from the dead mice.\n\nHe concluded that the R strain bacteria had somehow been\n\ntransformed by the heat-killed S strain bacteria. Some ‘transforming\n\nprinciple’, transferred from the heat-killed S strain, had enabled the\n\nR strain to synthesise a smooth polysaccharide coat and become virulent.\n\nThis must be due to the transfer of the genetic material. However, the\n\nbiochemical nature of genetic material was not defined from his\n\nexperiments.\n\nBiochemical Characterisation of Transforming Principle\n\nPrior to the work of Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod and Maclyn McCarty\n\n(1933-44), the genetic material was thought to be a protein.  They worked\n\nto determine the biochemical nature of ‘transforming principle’ in Griffith's\n\nexperiment.\n\nThey purified biochemicals (proteins, DNA, RNA, etc.) from the\n\nheat-killed S cells to see which ones could transform live R cells into\n\nS cells. They discovered that DNA alone from S bacteria caused R bacteria\n\nto become transformed.\n\nThey also discovered that protein-digesting enzymes (proteases) and\n\nRNA-digesting enzymes (RNases) did not affect transformation, so the\n\ntransforming substance was not a protein or RNA. Digestion with DNase\n\ndid inhibit transformation, suggesting that the DNA caused the\n\ntransformation. They concluded that DNA is the hereditary material, but\n\nnot all biologists were convinced.\n\nCan you think of any difference between DNAs and DNase?\n\n6.2.1 The Genetic Material is DNA\n\nThe unequivocal proof that DNA is the genetic material came from the\n\nexperiments of Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase (1952). They worked\n\nwith viruses that infect bacteria called bacteriophages.\n\nThe bacteriophage attaches to the bacteria and its genetic material\n\nthen enters the bacterial cell. The bacterial cell treats the viral genetic\n\nmaterial as if it was its own and subsequently manufactures more virus\n\nparticles. Hershey and Chase worked to discover whether it was protein\n\nor DNA from the viruses that entered the bacteria.\n\nThey grew some viruses on a medium that contained radioactive\n\nphosphorus and some others on medium that contained radioactive sulfur.\n\nViruses grown in the presence of radioactive phosphorus contained\n\nradioactive DNA but not radioactive protein because DNA contains\n\nphosphorus but protein does not.  Similarly, viruses grown on radioactive\n\nsulfur contained radioactive protein but not radioactive DNA because\n\nDNA does not contain sulfur.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n102\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nRadioactive phages were allowed to attach to E. coli bacteria. Then, as\n\nthe infection proceeded, the viral coats were removed from the bacteria by\n\nagitating them in a blender. The virus particles were separated from the\n\nbacteria by spinning them in a centrifuge.\n\nBacteria which was infected with viruses that had radioactive DNA\n\nwere radioactive, indicating that DNA was the material that passed from\n\nthe virus to the bacteria. Bacteria that were infected with viruses that had\n\nradioactive proteins were not radioactive. This indicates that proteins did\n\nnot enter the bacteria from the viruses. DNA is therefore the genetic\n\nmaterial that is passed from virus to bacteria (Figure 6.5).\n\nFigure 6.5 The Hershey-Chase experiment\n\n6.2.2 Properties of Genetic Material (DNA versus RNA)\n\nFrom the foregoing discussion, it is clear that the debate between proteins\n\nversus DNA as the genetic material was unequivocally resolved from\n\nHershey-Chase experiment. It became an established fact that it is DNA\n\nthat acts as genetic material. However, it subsequently became clear that\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n103\n\nMOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE\n\nin some viruses, RNA is the genetic material (for example, Tobacco Mosaic\n\nviruses, QB bacteriophage, etc.).  Answer to some of the questions such as,\n\nwhy DNA is the predominant genetic material, whereas RNA performs\n\ndynamic functions of messenger and adapter has to be found from the\n\ndifferences between chemical structures of the two nucleic acid molecules.\n\nCan you recall the two chemical differences between DNA and RNA?\n\nA molecule that can act as a genetic material must fulfill the following\n\ncriteria:\n\n(i) It should be able to generate its replica (Replication).\n\n(ii) It should be stable chemically and structurally.\n\n(iii) It should provide the scope for slow changes (mutation) that\n\nare required for evolution.\n\n(iv) It should be able to express itself in the form of 'Mendelian\n\nCharacters’.\n\nIf one examines each requirement one by one, because of rule of base\n\npairing and complementarity, both the nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) have\n\nthe ability to direct their duplications. The other molecules in the living\n\nsystem, such as proteins fail to fulfill first criteria itself.\n\nThe genetic material should be stable enough not to change with\n\ndifferent stages of life cycle, age or with change in physiology of the\n\norganism.  Stability as one of the properties of genetic material was very\n\nevident in Griffith’s ‘transforming principle’ itself that heat, which killed\n\nthe bacteria, at least did not destroy some of the properties of genetic\n\nmaterial. This now can easily be explained in light of the DNA that the\n\ntwo strands being complementary if separated by heating come together,\n\nwhen appropriate conditions are provided.  Further, 2'-OH group present\n\nat every nucleotide in RNA is a reactive group and makes RNA labile and\n\neasily degradable. RNA is also now known to be catalytic, hence reactive.\n\nTherefore, DNA chemically is less reactive and structurally more stable\n\nwhen compared to RNA. Therefore, among the two nucleic acids, the DNA\n\nis a better genetic material.\n\nIn fact, the presence of thymine at the place of uracil also confers\n\nadditional stability to DNA. (Detailed discussion about this requires\n\nunderstanding of the process of repair in DNA, and you will study these\n\nprocesses in higher classes.)\n\nBoth DNA and RNA are able to mutate.  In fact, RNA being unstable,\n\nmutate at a faster rate.  Consequently, viruses having RNA genome and\n\nhaving shorter life span mutate and evolve faster.\n\nRNA can directly code for the synthesis of proteins, hence can easily\n\nexpress the characters.  DNA, however, is dependent on RNA for synthesis\n\nof proteins.  The protein synthesising machinery has evolved around RNA.\n\nThe above discussion indicate that both RNA and DNA can function as\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n104\n\nBIOLOGY\n\ngenetic material, but DNA being more stable is preferred for storage of\n\ngenetic information. For the transmission of genetic information, RNA\n\nis better.\n\n6.3 RNA WORLD\n\nFrom foregoing discussion, an immediate question becomes evident –\n\nwhich is the first genetic material? It shall be discussed in detail in the\n\nchapter on chemical evolution, but briefly, we shall highlight some of the\n\nfacts and points.\n\nRNA was the first genetic material.  There is now enough evidence to\n\nsuggest that essential life processes (such as metabolism, translation,\n\nsplicing, etc.), evolved around RNA. RNA used to act as\n\na genetic material as well as a catalyst (there are some\n\nimportant biochemical reactions in living systems that\n\nare catalysed by RNA catalysts and not by protein\n\nenzymes). But, RNA being a catalyst was reactive and\n\nhence unstable.  Therefore, DNA has evolved from RNA\n\nwith chemical modifications that make it more stable.\n\nDNA being double stranded and having complementary\n\nstrand further resists changes by evolving a process of\n\nrepair.\n\n6.4 REPLICATION\n\nWhile proposing the double helical structure for DNA,\n\nWatson and Crick had immediately proposed a scheme\n\nfor replication of DNA. To quote their original statement\n\nthat is as follows:\n\n‘‘It has not escaped our notice that the specific\n\npairing we have postulated immediately suggests a\n\npossible copying mechanism for the genetic material’’\n\n(Watson and Crick, 1953).\n\nThe scheme suggested that the two strands would\n\nseparate and act as a template for the synthesis of new\n\ncomplementary strands. After the completion of\n\nreplication, each DNA molecule would have one\n\nparental and one newly synthesised strand. This\n\nscheme was termed as semiconservative DNA\n\nreplication (Figure 6.6).\n\n6.4.1 The Experimental Proof\n\nIt is now proven that DNA replicates semiconservatively.  It was shown first in\n\nEscherichia coli and subsequently in higher organisms, such as plants\n\nFigure 6.6 Watson-Crick model for\nsemiconservative DNA\nreplication\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n105\n\nMOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE\n\nFigure 6.7 Meselson and Stahl’s Experiment\n\nand human cells. Matthew Meselson and Franklin Stahl performed the\n\nfollowing experiment in 1958:\n\n(i) They grew E. coli in a medium containing 15NH\n4\nCl (15N is the heavy\n\nisotope of nitrogen) as the only nitrogen source for many\n\ngenerations. The result was that 15N was incorporated into newly\n\nsynthesised DNA (as well as other nitrogen containing compounds).\n\nThis heavy DNA molecule could be distinguished from the normal\n\nDNA by centrifugation in a cesium chloride (CsCl) density gradient\n\n(Please note that 15N is not a radioactive isotope, and it can be\n\nseparated from 14N only based on densities).\n\n(ii) Then they transferred the cells into a medium with normal\n14NH\n\n4\nCl and took samples at various definite time intervals as\n\nthe cells multiplied, and extracted the DNA that remained as\n\ndouble-stranded helices.  The various samples were separated\n\nindependently on CsCl gradients to measure the densities of\n\nDNA (Figure 6.7).\n\nCan you recall what centrifugal force is, and think why a\n\nmolecule with higher mass/density would sediment faster?\n\nThe results are shown in Figure 6.7.\n\n(iii) Thus, the DNA that was extracted from the culture one\n\ngeneration after the transfer from 15N to 14N medium [that is\n\nafter 20 minutes; E. coli divides in 20 minutes] had a hybrid or\n\nintermediate density.  DNA extracted from the culture after\n\nanother generation [that is after 40 minutes, II generation] was\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n106\n\nBIOLOGY\n\ncomposed of equal amounts of this hybrid DNA and of ‘light’\n\nDNA.\n\nIf E. coli was allowed to grow for 80 minutes then what would be the\n\nproportions of light and hybrid densities DNA molecule?\n\nVery similar experiments involving use of radioactive thymidine to\n\ndetect distribution of newly synthesised DNA in the chromosomes was\n\nperformed on Vicia faba (faba beans) by Taylor and colleagues in 1958.\n\nThe experiments proved that the DNA in chromosomes also replicate\n\nsemiconservatively.\n\n6.4.2 The Machinery and the Enzymes\n\n In living cells, such as E. coli, the process of replication requires a set of\n\ncatalysts (enzymes).  The main enzyme is referred to as DNA-dependent\n\nDNA polymerase, since it uses a DNA template to catalyse the\n\npolymerisation of deoxynucleotides. These enzymes are highly efficient\n\nenzymes as they have to catalyse polymerisation of a large number of\n\nnucleotides in a very short time. E. coli that has only 4.6 ×106 bp (compare\n\nit with human whose diploid content is 6.6 × 109 bp), completes the\n\nprocess of replication within 18 minutes; that means the average rate of\n\npolymerisation has to be approximately 2000 bp per second. Not only do\n\nthese polymerases have to be fast, but they also have to catalyse the reaction\n\nwith high degree of accuracy.  Any mistake during replication would result\n\ninto mutations.  Furthermore, energetically replication is a very expensive\n\nprocess. Deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates serve dual purposes. In\n\naddition to acting as substrates, they provide energy for polymerisation\n\nreaction (the two terminal phosphates in a deoxynucleoside triphosphates\n\nare high-energy phosphates, same as in case of ATP).\n\nIn addition to DNA-dependent DNA polymerases, many additional\n\nenzymes are required to complete the process of replication with high\n\ndegree of accuracy.  For long DNA molecules, since the two strands of\n\nDNA cannot be separated in its entire length (due to very high energy\n\nrequirement), the replication occur within a small opening of the DNA\n\nhelix, referred to as replication fork. The DNA-dependent DNA\n\npolymerases catalyse polymerisation only in one direction, that is 5'à3' .\n\nThis creates some additional complications at the replicating fork.\n\nConsequently, on one strand (the template with polarity 3'à5' ), the\n\nreplication is continuous, while on the other (the template with\n\npolarity 5'à3' ), it is discontinuous. The discontinuously synthesised\n\nfragments are later joined by the enzyme DNA ligase (Figure 6.8).\n\nThe DNA polymerases on their own cannot initiate the process of\n\nreplication.  Also the replication does not initiate randomly at any place\n\nin DNA. There is a definite region in E. coli DNA where the replication\n\noriginates. Such regions are termed as origin of replication. It is\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n107\n\nMOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE\n\nbecause of the requirement of the origin of\n\nreplication that a piece of DNA if needed to be\n\npropagated during recombinant DNA procedures,\n\nrequires a vector. The vectors provide the origin of\n\nreplication.\n\nFurther, not every detail of replication is\n\nunderstood well.  In eukaryotes, the replication of\n\nDNA takes place at S-phase of the cell-cycle.  The\n\nreplication of DNA and cell division cycle should be\n\nhighly coordinated. A failure in cell division after\n\nDNA replication results into polyploidy(a\n\nchromosomal anomaly). You will learn the detailed\n\nnature of origin and the processes occurring at this\n\nsite, in higher classes.\n\n6.5 TRANSCRIPTION\n\nThe process of copying genetic information from one\n\nstrand of the DNA into RNA is termed as\n\ntranscription. Here also, the principle of\n\ncomplementarity governs the process of transcription, except the adenosine\n\ncomplements now forms base pair with uracil instead of thymine.  However,\n\nunlike in the process of replication, which once set in, the total DNA of an\n\norganism gets duplicated, in transcription only a segment of DNA and\n\nonly one of the strands is copied into RNA.  This necessitates defining the\n\nboundaries that would demarcate the region and the strand of DNA that\n\nwould be transcribed.\n\nWhy both the strands are not copied during transcription has the\n\nsimple answer. First, if both strands act as a template, they would code\n\nfor RNA molecule with different sequences (Remember complementarity\n\ndoes not mean identical), and in turn, if they code for proteins, the sequence\n\nof amino acids in the proteins would be different. Hence, one segment of\n\nthe DNA would be coding for two different proteins, and this would\n\ncomplicate the genetic information transfer machinery. Second, the two\n\nRNA molecules if produced simultaneously would be complementary to\n\neach other, hence would form a double stranded RNA. This would prevent\n\nRNA from being translated into protein and the exercise of transcription\n\nwould become a futile one.\n\n6.5.1 Transcription Unit\n\nA transcription unit in DNA is defined primarily by the three regions in\n\nthe DNA:\n\n(i) A Promoter\n\n(ii) The Structural gene\n\n(iii) A Terminator\n\nFigure 6.8 Replicating Fork\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n108\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nThere is a convention in defining the two strands of the DNA in the\n\nstructural gene of a transcription unit.  Since the two strands have opposite\n\npolarity and the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase also catalyse the\n\npolymerisation in only one direction, that is, 5'→3' , the strand that has\n\nthe polarity 3'→5'  acts as a template, and is also referred to as template\n\nstrand. The other strand which has the polarity (5'→3' ) and the sequence\n\nsame as RNA (except thymine at the place of uracil), is displaced during\n\ntranscription.  Strangely, this strand (which does not code for anything)\n\nis referred to as coding strand.  All the reference point while defining a\n\ntranscription unit is made with coding strand. To explain the point, a\n\nhypothetical sequence from a transcription unit is represented below:\n\n3'-ATGCATGCATGCATGCATGCATGC-5'    Template Strand\n\n5'-TACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACG-3'    Coding Strand\n\nCan you now write the sequence of RNA transcribed from the above DNA?\n\nFigure 6.9 Schematic structure of a transcription unit\n\nThe promoter and terminator flank the structural gene in a\n\ntranscription unit.  The promoter is said to be located towards 5'-end\n\n(upstream) of the structural gene (the reference is made with respect to\n\nthe polarity of coding strand).  It is a DNA sequence that provides binding\n\nsite for RNA polymerase, and it is the presence of a promoter in a\n\ntranscription unit that also defines the template and coding strands.  By\nswitching its position with terminator, the definition of coding and template\n\nstrands could be reversed. The terminator is located towards 3'-end\n\n(downstream) of the coding strand and it usually defines the end of the\nprocess of transcription (Figure 6.9). There are additional regulatory\nsequences that may be present further upstream or downstream to the\npromoter.  Some of the properties of these sequences shall be discussed\nwhile dealing with regulation of gene expression.\n\n6.5.2 Transcription Unit and the Gene\n\nA gene is defined as the functional unit of inheritance. Though there is no\nambiguity that the genes are located on the DNA, it is difficult to literally\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n109\n\nMOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE\n\ndefine a gene in terms of DNA sequence. The DNA sequence coding for\ntRNA or rRNA molecule also define a gene. However by defining a cistron\nas a segment of DNA coding for a polypeptide, the structural gene in a\ntranscription unit could be said as monocistronic (mostly in eukaryotes)\nor polycistronic (mostly in bacteria or prokaryotes). In eukaryotes, the\nmonocistronic structural genes have interrupted coding sequences – the\ngenes in eukaryotes are split. The coding sequences or expressed\nsequences are defined as exons. Exons are said to be those sequence\nthat appear in mature or processed RNA.  The exons are interrupted by\nintrons.  Introns or intervening sequences do not appear in mature or\nprocessed RNA. The split-gene arrangement further complicates the\ndefinition of a gene in terms of a DNA segment.\n\nInheritance of a character is also affected by promoter and regulatory\nsequences of a structural gene.  Hence, sometime the regulatory sequences\nare loosely defined as regulatory genes, even though these sequences do\n\nnot code for any RNA or protein.\n\n6.5.3 Types of RNA and the process of Transcription\n\nIn bacteria, there are three major types of RNAs: mRNA (messenger RNA),\n\ntRNA (transfer RNA), and rRNA (ribosomal RNA).  All three RNAs are\n\nneeded to synthesise a protein in a cell.  The mRNA provides the template,\n\ntRNA brings aminoacids and reads the genetic code, and rRNAs play\n\nstructural and catalytic role during translation. There is single\n\nDNA-dependent RNA polymerase that catalyses transcription of all types\n\nof RNA in bacteria. RNA polymerase binds to promoter and initiates\n\ntranscription (Initiation). It uses nucleoside triphosphates as substrate\n\n Figure 6.10 Process of Transcription in Bacteria\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n110\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nand polymerises in a template depended fashion following the rule of\n\ncomplementarity.  It somehow also facilitates opening of the helix and\n\ncontinues elongation.  Only a short stretch of RNA remains bound to the\n\nenzyme. Once the polymerases reaches the terminator region, the nascent\n\nRNA falls off, so also the RNA polymerase.  This results in termination of\n\ntranscription.\n\nAn intriguing question is that how is the RNA polymerases able\n\nto catalyse all the three steps, which are initiation, elongation and\n\ntermination.  The RNA polymerase is only capable of catalysing the\n\nprocess of elongation.  It associates transiently with initiation-factor (σ)\n\nand termination-factor (ρ) to initiate and terminate the transcription,\n\nrespectively. Association with these factors alter the specificity of the\n\nRNA polymerase to either initiate or terminate (Figure 6.10).\n\nIn bacteria, since the mRNA does not require any processing to become\n\nactive, and also since transcription and translation take place in the same\n\ncompartment (there is no separation of cytosol and nucleus in bacteria),\n\nmany times the translation can begin much before the mRNA is fully\n\ntranscribed. Consequently, the transcription and translation can be coupled\n\nin bacteria.\n\nIn eukaryotes, there are two additional complexities –\n\n(i) There are at least three RNA polymerases in the nucleus (in addition\n\nto the RNA polymerase found in the organelles). There is a clear\n\ncut division of labour. The RNA polymerase I transcribes rRNAs\n\nFigure 6.11 Process of Transcription in Eukaryotes\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n111\n\nMOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE\n\n(28S, 18S, and 5.8S), whereas the RNA polymerase III is responsible\n\nfor transcription of tRNA, 5srRNA, and snRNAs (small nuclear\n\nRNAs). The RNA polymerase II transcribes precursor of mRNA, the\n\nheterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA).\n\n(ii) The second complexity is that the primary transcripts contain both\n\nthe exons and the introns and are non-functional. Hence, it is\n\nsubjected to a process called splicing where the introns are removed\n\nand exons are joined in a defined order. hnRNA undergoes\n\nadditional processing called as capping and tailing. In capping an\n\nunusual nucleotide (methyl guanosine triphosphate) is added to\n\nthe 5'-end of hnRNA. In tailing, adenylate residues (200-300) are\n\nadded at 3'-end in a template independent manner. It is the fully\n\nprocessed hnRNA, now called mRNA, that is transported out of the\n\nnucleus for translation (Figure 6.11).\n\nThe significance of such complexities is now beginning to be\n\nunderstood.  The split-gene arrangements represent probably an ancient\n\nfeature of the genome.  The presence of introns is reminiscent of antiquity,\n\nand the process of splicing represents the dominance of RNA-world.  In\n\nrecent times, the understanding of RNA and RNA-dependent processes\n\nin the living system have assumed more importance.\n\n6.6  GENETIC CODE\n\nDuring replication and transcription a nucleic acid was copied to form\n\nanother nucleic acid. Hence, these processes are easy to conceptualise\n\non the basis of complementarity. The process of translation requires\n\ntransfer of genetic information from a polymer of nucleotides to synthesise\n\na polymer of amino acids. Neither does any complementarity exist between\n\nnucleotides and amino acids, nor could any be drawn theoretically. There\n\nexisted ample evidences, though, to support the notion that change in\n\nnucleic acids (genetic material) were responsible for change in amino acids\n\nin proteins.  This led to the proposition of a genetic code that could direct\n\nthe sequence of amino acids during synthesis of proteins.\n\nIf determining the biochemical nature of genetic material and the\n\nstructure of DNA was very exciting, the proposition and deciphering of\n\ngenetic code were most challenging. In a very true sense, it required\n\ninvolvement of scientists from several disciplines – physicists, organic\n\nchemists, biochemists and geneticists. It was George Gamow, a physicist,\n\nwho argued that since there are only 4 bases and if they have to code for\n\n20 amino acids, the code should constitute a combination of bases. He\n\nsuggested that in order to code for all the 20 amino acids, the code should\n\nbe made up of three nucleotides. This was a very bold proposition, because\n\na permutation combination of 43 (4 × 4 × 4) would generate 64 codons;\n\ngenerating many more codons than required.\n\nProviding proof that the codon was a triplet, was a more daunting\n\ntask. The chemical method developed by Har Gobind Khorana was\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n112\n\nBIOLOGY\n\ninstrumental in synthesising RNA molecules with defined combinations\n\nof bases (homopolymers and copolymers). Marshall Nirenberg’s cell-free\n\nsystem for protein synthesis finally helped the code to be deciphered.\n\nSevero Ochoa enzyme (polynucleotide phosphorylase) was also helpful\n\nin polymerising RNA with defined sequences in a template independent\n\nmanner (enzymatic synthesis of RNA). Finally a checker-board for genetic\n\ncode was prepared which is given in Table 6.1.\n\nTable 6.1: The Codons for the Various Amino Acids\n\nThe salient features of genetic code are as follows:\n\n(i) The codon is triplet. 61 codons code for amino acids and 3 codons do\n\nnot code for any amino acids, hence they function as stop codons.\n\n(ii) Some amino acids are coded by more than one codon, hence\n\nthe code is degenerate.\n\n(iii) The codon is read in mRNA in a contiguous fashion. There are\n\nno punctuations.\n\n(iv) The code is nearly universal: for example, from bacteria to human\n\nUUU would code for Phenylalanine (phe). Some exceptions to this\n\nrule have been found in mitochondrial codons, and in some\n\nprotozoans.\n\n(v) AUG has dual functions. It codes for Methionine (met) , and it\n\nalso act as initiator codon.\n\n(vi) UAA, UAG, UGA are stop terminator codons.\n\nIf following is the sequence of nucleotides in mRNA, predict the\n\nsequence of amino acid coded by it (take help of the checkerboard):\n\n-AUG UUU UUC UUC UUU UUU UUC-\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n113\n\nMOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE\n\nNow try the opposite.  Following is the sequence of amino acids coded\n\nby an mRNA. Predict the nucleotide sequence in the RNA:\n\nMet-Phe-Phe-Phe-Phe-Phe-Phe\n\nDo you face any difficulty in predicting the opposite?\n\nCan you now correlate which two properties of genetic code you have\n\nlearnt?\n\n6.6.1 Mutations and Genetic Code\n\nThe relationships between genes and DNA are best understood by mutation\n\nstudies. You have studied about mutation and its effect in Chapter  5.  Effects\n\nof large deletions and rearrangements in a segment of DNA are easy to\n\ncomprehend.  It may result in loss or gain of a gene and so a function.  The\n\neffect of point mutations will be explained here.  A classical example of\n\npoint mutation is a change of single base pair in the gene for beta globin\n\nchain that results in the change of amino acid residue glutamate to valine.\n\nIt results into a diseased condition called as sickle cell anemia. Effect of\n\npoint mutations that inserts or deletes a base in structural gene can be\n\nbetter understood by following simple example.\n\nConsider a statement that is made up of the following words each\n\nhaving three letters like genetic code.\n\nRAM  HAS  RED  CAP\n\nIf we insert a letter B in between HAS and RED and rearrange the\n\nstatement, it would read as follows:\n\nRAM  HAS  BRE  DCA  P\n\nSimilarly, if we now insert two letters at the same place, say BI'. Now it\n\nwould read,\n\nRAM  HAS  BIR  EDC  AP\n\nNow we insert three letters together, say BIG, the statement would read\n\nRAM  HAS  BIG  RED  CAP\n\nThe same exercise can be repeated, by deleting the letters R, E and D,\n\none by one and rearranging the statement to make a triplet word.\n\nRAM  HAS  EDC  AP\n\nRAM  HAS  DCA  P\n\nRAM  HAS  CAP\n\nThe conclusion from the above exercise is very obvious. Insertion or\n\ndeletion of one or two bases changes the reading frame from the point of\n\ninsertion or deletion. However, such mutations are referred to as\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n114\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nframeshift insertion or deletion mutations. Insertion or deletion of\n\nthree or its multiple bases insert or delete in one or multiple codon hence\n\none or multiple amino acids, and reading frame remains unaltered from\n\nthat point onwards.\n\n6.6.2 tRNA– the Adapter Molecule\n\nFrom the very beginning of the proposition of code, it was clear to Francis\n\nCrick that there has to be a mechanism to read the code and also to link it\n\nto the amino acids, because amino acids have no structural specialities to\n\nread the code uniquely.  He postulated the presence of an adapter molecule\n\nthat would on one hand read the code and on other hand would bind\n\nto specific amino acids. The tRNA, then called sRNA (soluble RNA),\n\nwas known before the genetic code was postulated. However, its role\n\nas an adapter molecule was assigned much later.\n\ntRNA has an\n\nanticodon loop\n\nthat has bases\n\ncomplementary to\n\nthe code, and it also\n\nhas an amino acid\n\nacceptor  end to\n\nwhich it binds to\n\namino acids.\n\ntRNAs are specific\n\nfor each amino acid\n\n(Figure 6.12).  For\n\ninitiation, there is\n\nanother specific tRNA that is referred to as initiator tRNA. There are no\n\ntRNAs for stop codons.  In figure 6.12, the secondary structure of tRNA\n\nhas been depicted that looks like a clover-leaf. In actual structure, the\n\ntRNA is a compact molecule which looks like inverted L.\n\n6.7  TRANSLATION\n\nTranslation refers to the process of polymerisation of amino acids to\n\nform a polypeptide (Figure 6.13). The order and sequence of amino acids\n\nare defined by the sequence of bases in the mRNA. The amino acids are\n\njoined by a bond which is known as a peptide bond.  Formation of a\n\npeptide bond requires energy.  Therefore, in the first phase itself amino\n\nacids are activated in the presence of ATP and linked to their cognate\n\ntRNA –a process commonly called as charging of tRNA or\n\naminoacylation of tRNA to be more specific.  If two such charged tRNAs\n\nare brought close enough, the formation of peptide bond between them\n\nFigure 6.12 tRNA - the adapter molecule\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n115\n\nMOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE\n\nwould be favoured energetically. The\n\npresence of a catalyst would enhance\n\nthe rate of peptide bond formation.\n\nThe cellular factory responsible for\n\nsynthesising proteins is the ribosome.\n\nThe ribosome consists of structural\n\nRNAs and about 80 different proteins.\n\nIn its inactive state, it exists as two\n\nsubunits; a large subunit and a small\n\nsubunit. When the small subunit\n\nencounters an mRNA, the process of\n\ntranslation of the mRNA to protein\n\nbegins.  There are two sites in the large\n\nsubunit, for subsequent amino acids\n\nto bind to and thus, be close enough\n\nto each other for the formation of a\n\npeptide bond. The ribosome also acts as a catalyst (23S rRNA in bacteria\n\nis the enzyme- ribozyme) for the formation of peptide bond.\n\nA translational unit in mRNA is the sequence of RNA that is flanked\n\nby the start codon (AUG) and the stop codon and codes for a polypeptide.\n\nAn mRNA also has some additional sequences that are not translated\n\nand are referred as untranslated regions (UTR).  The UTRs are present\n\nat both 5'-end (before start codon) and at 3'-end (after stop codon).  They\n\nare required for efficient translation process.\n\nFor initiation, the ribosome binds to the mRNA at the start codon (AUG)\n\nthat is recognised only by the initiator tRNA.  The ribosome proceeds to the\n\nelongation phase of protein synthesis. During this stage, complexes\n\ncomposed of an amino acid linked to tRNA, sequentially bind to the\n\nappropriate codon in mRNA by forming complementary base pairs with\n\nthe tRNA anticodon.  The ribosome moves from codon to codon along the\n\nmRNA. Amino acids are added one by one, translated into Polypeptide\n\nsequences dictated by DNA and represented by mRNA.  At the end, a release\n\nfactor binds to the stop codon, terminating translation and releasing the\n\ncomplete polypeptide from the ribosome.\n\n6.8  REGULATION OF GENE EXPRESSION\n\nRegulation of gene expression refers to a very broad term that may occur\n\nat various levels. Considering that gene expression results in the formation\n\nof a polypeptide, it can be regulated at several levels. In eukaryotes, the\n\nregulation could be exerted at\n\n(i) transcriptional level (formation of primary transcript),\n\n(ii) processing level (regulation of splicing),\n\n(iii) transport of mRNA from nucleus to the cytoplasm,\n\n(iv) translational level.\n\nFigure 6.13 Translation\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n116\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nThe genes in a cell are expressed to perform a particular function or a\n\nset of functions.  For example, if an enzyme called beta-galactosidase is\n\nsynthesised by E. coli, it is used to catalyse the hydrolysis of a\n\ndisaccharide, lactose into galactose and glucose; the bacteria use them\n\nas a source of energy.  Hence, if the bacteria do not have lactose around\n\nthem to be utilised for energy source, they would no longer require the\n\nsynthesis of the enzyme beta-galactosidase.  Therefore, in simple terms,\n\nit is the metabolic, physiological or environmental conditions that regulate\n\nthe expression of genes.  The development and differentiation of embryo\n\ninto adult organisms are also a result of the coordinated regulation of\n\nexpression of several sets of genes.\n\nIn prokaryotes, control of the rate of transcriptional initiation is the\n\npredominant site for control of gene expression.  In a transcription unit,\n\nthe activity of RNA polymerase at a given promoter is in turn regulated\n\nby interaction with accessory proteins, which affect its ability to recognise\n\nstart sites.  These regulatory proteins can act both positively (activators)\n\nand negatively (repressors).  The accessibility of promoter regions of\n\nprokaryotic DNA is in many cases regulated by the interaction of proteins\n\nwith sequences termed operators.  The operator region is adjacent to the\n\npromoter elements in most operons and in most cases the sequences of\n\nthe operator bind a repressor protein.  Each operon has its specific\n\noperator and specific repressor.  For example, lac operator is present\n\nonly in the lac operon and it interacts specifically with lac repressor only.\n\n6.8.1 The Lac operon\n\nThe elucidation of the lac operon was also a result of a close association\n\nbetween a geneticist, Francois Jacob and a biochemist, Jacque Monod.  They\n\nwere the first to elucidate a transcriptionally regulated system.  In lac operon\n\n(here lac refers to lactose), a polycistronic structural gene is regulated by a\n\ncommon promoter and regulatory genes. Such arrangement is very common\n\nin bacteria and is referred to as operon.  To name few such examples, lac\n\noperon, trp operon, ara operon, his operon, val operon, etc.\n\nThe lac operon consists of one regulatory gene (the i gene – here the\n\nterm i  does not refer to inducer, rather it is derived from the word inhibitor)\n\nand three structural genes (z, y, and a).  The i gene codes for the repressor\n\nof the lac operon. The z gene codes for beta-galactosidase (β-gal), which\n\nis primarily responsible for the hydrolysis of the disaccharide, lactose\n\ninto its monomeric units, galactose and glucose. The y gene codes for\n\npermease, which increases permeability of the cell to β-galactosides. The\n\na gene encodes a transacetylase.  Hence, all the three gene products in\n\nlac operon are required for metabolism of lactose.  In most other operons\n\nas well, the genes present in the operon are needed together to function\n\nin the same or related metabolic pathway (Figure 6.14).\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n117\n\nMOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE\n\nLactose is the substrate for the enzyme beta-galactosidase and it\n\nregulates switching on and off of the operon. Hence, it is termed as inducer.\n\nIn the absence of a preferred carbon source such as glucose, if lactose is\n\nprovided in the growth medium of the bacteria, the lactose is transported\n\ninto the cells through the action of permease (Remember, a very low level\n\nof expression of lac operon has to be present in the cell all the time,\n\notherwise lactose cannot enter the cells). The lactose then induces the\n\noperon in the following manner.\n\nThe repressor of the operon is synthesised (all-the-time – constitutively)\n\nfrom the i gene. The repressor protein binds to the operator region of the\n\noperon and prevents RNA polymerase from transcribing the operon.  In\n\nthe presence of an inducer, such as lactose or allolactose, the repressor is\n\ninactivated by interaction with the inducer. This allows RNA polymerase\n\naccess to the promoter and transcription proceeds (Figure 6.14).\n\nEssentially, regulation of lac operon can also be visualised as regulation\n\nof enzyme synthesis by its substrate.\n\nRemember, glucose or galactose cannot act as inducers for lac\n\noperon. Can you think for how long the lac operon would be expressed\n\nin the presence of lactose?\n\nRegulation of lac operon by repressor is referred to as negative\n\nregulation.  Lac operon is under control of positive regulation as well,\n\nbut it is beyond the scope of discussion at this level.\n\nFigure 6.14 The lac  Operon\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n118\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n6.9 HUMAN GENOME PROJECT\n\nIn the preceding sections you have learnt that it is the sequence of bases in\n\nDNA that determines the genetic information of a given organism. In other\n\nwords, genetic make-up of an organism or an individual lies in the DNA\n\nsequences. If two individuals differ, then their DNA sequences should also\n\nbe different, at least at some places. These assumptions led to the quest of\n\nfinding out the complete DNA sequence of human genome. With the\n\nestablishment of genetic engineering techniques where it was possible to\n\nisolate and clone any piece of DNA and availability of simple and fast\n\ntechniques for determining DNA sequences, a very ambitious project of\n\nsequencing human genome was launched in the year 1990.\n\nHuman Genome Project (HGP) was called a mega project.  You can\n\nimagine the magnitude and the requirements for the project if we simply\n\ndefine the aims of the project as follows:\n\nHuman genome is said to have approximately 3 x 109 bp, and if the\n\ncost of sequencing required is US $ 3 per bp (the estimated cost in the\n\nbeginning), the total estimated cost of the project would be approximately\n\n9 billion US dollars. Further, if the obtained sequences were to be stored\n\nin typed form in books, and if each page of the book contained 1000\n\nletters and each book contained 1000 pages, then 3300 such books would\n\nbe required to store the information of DNA sequence from a single human\n\ncell. The enormous amount of data expected to be generated also\n\nnecessitated the use of high speed computational devices for data storage\n\nand retrieval, and analysis.  HGP was closely associated with the rapid\n\ndevelopment of a new area in biology called Bioinformatics.\n\nGoals of HGP\n\nSome of the important goals of HGP were as follows:\n\n(i) Identify all the approximately 20,000-25,000 genes in human DNA;\n\n(ii) Determine the sequences of the 3 billion chemical base pairs that\n\nmake up human DNA;\n\n(iiii) Store this information in databases;\n\n(iv) Improve tools for data analysis;\n\n(v) Transfer related technologies to other sectors, such as industries;\n\n(vi) Address the ethical, legal, and social issues (ELSI) that may arise\n\nfrom the project.\n\nThe Human Genome Project was a 13-year project coordinated by\n\nthe U.S. Department of Energy and the National Institute of Health. During\n\nthe early years of the HGP, the Wellcome Trust (U.K.) became a major\n\npartner; additional contributions came from Japan, France, Germany,\n\nChina and others. The project was completed in 2003. Knowledge about\n\nthe effects of DNA variations among individuals can lead to revolutionary\n\nnew ways to diagnose, treat and someday prevent the thousands of\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n119\n\nMOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE\n\ndisorders that affect human beings. Besides providing clues to\n\nunderstanding human biology, learning about non-human organisms\n\nDNA sequences can lead to an understanding of their natural capabilities\n\nthat can be applied toward solving challenges in health care, agriculture,\n\nenergy production, environmental remediation. Many non-human model\n\norganisms, such as bacteria, yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans (a free living\n\nnon-pathogenic nematode), Drosophila (the fruit fly), plants (rice and\n\nArabidopsis), etc., have also been sequenced.\n\nMethodologies : The methods involved two major approaches. One\n\napproach focused on identifying all the genes that are expressed as\n\nRNA (referred to as Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs). The other took\n\nthe blind approach of simply sequencing the whole set of genome that\n\ncontained all the coding and non-coding sequence, and later assigning\n\ndifferent regions in the sequence with functions (a term referred to as\n\nSequence Annotation). For sequencing, the total DNA from a cell is\n\nisolated and converted into random fragments of relatively smaller sizes\n\n(recall DNA is a very long polymer, and there are technical limitations in\n\nsequencing very long pieces of DNA) and cloned in suitable host using\n\nspecialised vectors. The cloning resulted into amplification of each piece\n\nof DNA fragment so that it subsequently could be sequenced with ease.\n\nThe commonly used hosts were bacteria and yeast, and the vectors were\n\ncalled as BAC (bacterial artificial chromosomes), and YAC (yeast artificial\n\nchromosomes).\n\nThe fragments were sequenced using automated DNA sequencers that\n\nworked on the principle of a method developed by Frederick Sanger.\n\n(Remember, Sanger is also credited for developing method for\n\ndetermination of amino acid\n\nsequences in proteins). These\n\nsequences were then arranged based\n\non some overlapping regions\n\npresent in them.  This required\n\ngeneration of overlapping fragments\n\nfor sequencing.  Alignment of these\n\nsequences was humanly not\n\npossible. Therefore, specialised\n\ncomputer based programs were\n\ndeveloped (Figure 6.15). These\n\nsequences were subsequently\n\nannotated and were assigned to each\n\nchromosome. The sequence of\n\nchromosome 1 was completed only\n\nin May 2006 (this was the last of the\n\n24 human chromosomes – 22\n\nautosomes and X and Y – to be\n\n119\n\nFigure 6.15 A representative diagram of human\ngenome project\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n120\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nsequenced).  Another challenging task was assigning the genetic and\n\nphysical maps on the genome.  This was generated using information on\n\npolymorphism of restriction endonuclease recognition sites, and some\n\nrepetitive DNA sequences known as microsatellites (one of the applications\n\nof polymorphism in repetitive DNA sequences shall be explained in next\n\nsection of DNA fingerprinting).\n\n6.9.1 Salient Features of Human Genome\n\nSome of the salient observations drawn from human genome project are\n\nas follows:\n\n(i) The human genome contains 3164.7 million bp.\n\n(ii) The average gene consists of 3000 bases, but sizes vary greatly, with\n\nthe largest known human gene being dystrophin at 2.4 million bases.\n\n(iii) The total number of genes is estimated at 30,000–much lower\n\nthan previous estimates of 80,000 to 1,40,000 genes.  Almost all\n\n(99.9 per cent) nucleotide bases are exactly the same in all people.\n\n(iv) The functions are unknown for over 50 per cent of the discovered\n\ngenes.\n\n(v) Less than 2 per cent of the genome codes for proteins.\n\n(vi) Repeated sequences make up very large portion of the human genome.\n\n(vii) Repetitive sequences are stretches of DNA sequences that are\n\nrepeated many times, sometimes hundred to thousand times.  They\n\nare thought to have no direct coding functions, but they shed light\n\non chromosome structure, dynamics and evolution.\n\n(viii) Chromosome 1 has most genes (2968), and the Y has the fewest (231).\n\n(ix) Scientists have identified about 1.4 million locations where single-\n\nbase DNA differences (SNPs – single nucleotide polymorphism,\n\npronounced as ‘snips’) occur in humans.  This information promises\n\nto revolutionise the processes of finding chromosomal locations for\n\ndisease-associated sequences and tracing human history.\n\n6.9.2 Applications and Future Challenges\n\nDeriving meaningful knowledge from the DNA sequences will define\n\nresearch through the coming decades leading to our understanding of\n\nbiological systems. This enormous task will require the expertise and\n\ncreativity of tens of thousands of scientists from varied disciplines in both\n\nthe public and private sectors worldwide. One of the greatest impacts of\n\nhaving the HG sequence may well be enabling a radically new approach\n\nto biological research.  In the past, researchers studied one or a few genes\n\nat a time. With whole-genome sequences and new high-throughput\n\ntechnologies, we can approach questions systematically and on a much\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n121\n\nMOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE\n\nbroader scale.  They can study all the genes in a genome, for example, all\n\nthe transcripts in a particular tissue or organ or tumor, or how tens of\n\nthousands of genes and proteins work together in interconnected networks\n\nto orchestrate the chemistry of life.\n\n6.10 DNA FINGERPRINTING\n\nAs stated in the preceding section, 99.9 per cent of base sequence among\n\nhumans is the same. Assuming human genome as 3 × 109 bp, in how\n\nmany base sequences would there be differences?  It is these differences\n\nin sequence of DNA which make every individual unique in their\n\nphenotypic appearance. If one aims to find out genetic differences\n\nbetween two individuals or among individuals of a population,\n\nsequencing the DNA every time would be a daunting and expensive\n\ntask. Imagine trying to compare two sets of 3 × 10\n6\n base pairs. DNA\n\nfingerprinting is a very quick way to compare the DNA sequences of any\n\ntwo individuals.\n\nDNA fingerprinting involves identifying differences in some specific\n\nregions in DNA sequence called as repetitive DNA, because in these\n\nsequences, a small stretch of DNA is repeated many times. These repetitive\n\nDNA are separated from bulk genomic DNA as different peaks during\n\ndensity gradient centrifugation. The bulk DNA forms a major peak and\n\nthe other small peaks are referred to as satellite DNA. Depending on\n\nbase composition (A : T rich or G:C rich), length of segment, and number\n\nof repetitive units, the satellite DNA is classified into many categories,\n\nsuch as micro-satellites, mini-satellites etc. These sequences normally\n\ndo not code for any proteins, but they form a large portion of human\n\ngenome.  These sequence show high degree of polymorphism and form\n\nthe basis of DNA fingerprinting.  Since DNA from every tissue (such as\n\nblood, hair-follicle, skin, bone, saliva, sperm etc.), from an individual\n\nshow the same degree of polymorphism, they become very useful\n\nidentification tool in forensic applications. Further, as the polymorphisms\n\nare inheritable from parents to children, DNA fingerprinting is the basis\n\nof paternity testing, in case of disputes.\n\nAs polymorphism in DNA sequence is the basis of genetic mapping\n\nof human genome as well as of DNA fingerprinting, it is essential that we\n\nunderstand what DNA polymorphism means in simple terms.\n\nPolymorphism (variation at genetic level) arises due to mutations. (Recall\n\ndifferent kind of mutations and their effects that you have already\n\nstudied in Chapter 5, and in the preceding sections in this chapter.)\n\nNew mutations may arise in an individual either in somatic cells or in\n\nthe germ cells (cells that generate gametes in sexually reproducing\n\norganisms). If a germ cell mutation does not seriously impair individual’s\n\nability to have offspring who can transmit the mutation, it can spread to\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n122\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nthe other members of population (through sexual reproduction).  Allelic\n\n(again recall the definition of alleles from Chapter 5) sequence variation\n\nhas traditionally been described as a DNA polymorphism if more than\n\none variant (allele) at a locus occurs in human population with a\n\nfrequency greater than 0.01. In simple terms, if an inheritable mutation\n\nis observed in a population at high frequency, it is referred to as DNA\n\npolymorphism. The probability of such variation to be observed in non-\n\ncoding DNA sequence would be higher as mutations in these sequences\n\nmay not have any immediate effect/impact in an individual’s\n\nreproductive ability. These mutations keep on accumulating generation\n\nafter generation, and form one of the basis of variability/polymorphism.\n\nThere is a variety of different types of polymorphisms ranging from single\n\nnucleotide change to very large scale changes. For evolution and\n\nspeciation, such polymorphisms play very important role, and you will\n\nstudy these in details at higher classes.\n\nThe technique of DNA Fingerprinting was initially developed by Alec\n\nJeffreys. He used a satellite DNA as probe that shows very high degree\n\nof polymorphism.  It was called as Variable Number of Tandem Repeats\n\n(VNTR).  The technique, as used earlier, involved Southern blot\n\nhybridisation using radiolabelled VNTR as a probe. It included\n\n(i) isolation of DNA,\n\n(ii) digestion of DNA by restriction endonucleases,\n\n(iii) separation of DNA fragments by electrophoresis,\n\n(iv) transferring (blotting) of separated DNA fragments to synthetic\n\nmembranes, such as nitrocellulose or nylon,\n\n(v) hybridisation using labelled VNTR probe, and\n\n(vi) detection of hybridised DNA fragments by autoradiography. A schematic\n\nrepresentation of DNA fingerprinting is shown in Figure 6.16.\n\nThe VNTR belongs to a class of satellite DNA referred to as mini-satellite.\n\nA small DNA sequence is arranged tandemly in many copy numbers. The\n\ncopy number varies from chromosome to chromosome in an individual.\n\nThe numbers of repeat show very high degree of polymorphism. As a\n\nresult the size of VNTR varies in size from 0.1 to\n\n20 kb. Consequently, after hybridisation with VNTR probe, the\n\nautoradiogram gives many bands of differing sizes. These bands give a\n\ncharacteristic pattern for an individual DNA (Figure 6.16). It differs from\n\nindividual to individual in a population except in the case of monozygotic\n\n(identical) twins. The sensitivity of the technique has been increased by\n\nuse of polymerase chain reaction (PCR–you will study about it in\n\nChapter 11).  Consequently, DNA from a single cell is enough to perform\n\nDNA fingerprinting analysis. In addition to application in forensic\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n123\n\nMOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE\n\nFigure 6.16 Schematic representation of DNA fingerprinting : Few representative chromosomes\nhave been shown to contain different copy number of VNTR.  For the sake of\nunderstanding different colour schemes have been used to trace the origin of each\nband in the gel.  The two alleles (paternal and maternal) of a chromosome also\ncontain different copy numbers of VNTR.  It is clear that the banding pattern of DNA\nfrom crime scene matches with individual B, and not with A.\n\nscience, it has much wider application, such as in determining\n\npopulation and genetic diversities. Currently, many different probes\n\nare used to generate DNA fingerprints.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n124\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nSUMMARY\n\nNucleic acids are long polymers of nucleotides.  While DNA stores genetic\n\ninformation, RNA mostly helps in transfer and expression of information.\n\nThough DNA and RNA both function as genetic material, but DNA being\n\nchemically and structurally more stable is a better genetic material.\n\nHowever, RNA is the first to evolve and DNA was derived from RNA.  The\n\nhallmark of the double stranded helical structure of DNA is the hydrogen\n\nbonding between the bases from opposite strands. The rule is that\n\nAdenine pairs with Thymine through two H-bonds, and Guanine with\n\nCytosine through three H-bonds.  This makes one strand\n\ncomplementary to the other.  The DNA replicates semiconservatively,\n\nthe process is guided by the complementary H-bonding.  A segment of\n\nDNA that codes for RNA may in a simplistic term can be referred as\n\ngene. During transcription also, one of the strands of DNA acts a\n\ntemplate to direct the synthesis of complementary RNA.  In bacteria,\n\nthe transcribed mRNA is functional, hence can directly be translated.\n\nIn eukaryotes, the gene is split.  The coding sequences, exons, are\n\ninterrupted by non-coding sequences, introns.  Introns are removed\n\nand exons are joined to produce functional RNA by splicing. The\n\nmessenger RNA contains the base sequences that are read in a\n\ncombination of three (to make triplet genetic code) to code for an amino\n\nacid.  The genetic code is read again on the principle of complementarity\n\nby tRNA that acts as an adapter molecule.  There are specific tRNAs for\n\nevery amino acid.  The tRNA binds to specific amino acid at one end\n\nand pairs through H-bonding with codes on mRNA through its\n\nanticodons.  The site of translation (protein synthesis) is ribosomes,\n\nwhich bind to mRNA and provide platform for joining of amino acids.\n\nOne of the rRNA acts as a catalyst for peptide bond formation, which is\n\nan example of RNA enzyme (ribozyme). Translation is a process that\n\nhas evolved around RNA, indicating that life began around RNA. Since,\n\ntranscription and translation are energetically very expensive\n\nprocesses, these have to be tightly regulated.  Regulation of transcription\n\nis the primary step for regulation of gene expression. In bacteria, more\n\nthan one gene is arranged together and regulated in units called as\n\noperons. Lac operon is the prototype operon in bacteria, which codes\n\nfor genes responsible for metabolism of lactose.  The operon is regulated\n\nby the amount of lactose in the medium where the bacteria are grown.\n\nTherefore, this regulation can also be viewed as regulation of enzyme\n\nsynthesis by its substrate.\n\nHuman genome project was a mega project that aimed to sequence\n\nevery base in human genome. This project has yielded much new\n\ninformation. Many new areas and avenues have opened up as a\n\nconsequence of the project. DNA Fingerprinting is a technique to find\n\nout variations in individuals of a population at DNA level. It works on\n\nthe principle of polymorphism in DNA sequences. It has immense\n\napplications in the field of forensic science, genetic biodiversity and\n\nevolutionary biology.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n125\n\nMOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1 Group the following as nitrogenous bases and nucleosides:\n\nAdenine, Cytidine, Thymine, Guanosine, Uracil and Cytosine.\n\n2.

What exactly is evolution? To understand the\n\nchanges in flora and fauna that have occurred over millions\n\nof years on earth, we must have an understanding of the\n\ncontext of origin of life, i.e., evolution of earth, of stars and\n\nindeed of the universe itself. What follows is the longest of\n\nall the construed and conjectured stories. This is the story\n\nof origin of life and evolution of life forms or biodiversity on\n\nplanet earth in the context of evolution of earth and against\n\nthe background of evolution of universe itself.\n\n7.1 ORIGIN OF LIFE\n\nWhen we look at stars on a clear night sky we are, in a\n\nway,  looking back in time. Stellar distances are measured\n\nin light years. What we see today is an object whose emitted\n\nlight started its journey millions of year back and from\n\ntrillions of kilometres away and reaching our eyes now.\n\nHowever, when we see objects in our immediate\n\nsurroundings we see them instantly and hence in the\n\npresent time. Therefore, when we see stars we apparently\n\nare peeping into the past.\n\nThe origin of life is considered a unique event in the\n\nhistory of universe. The universe is vast. Relatively speaking\n\nthe earth itself is almost only a speck. The universe is very\n\nCHAPTER 7\n\nEVOLUTION\n\n7.1 Origin of Life\n\n7.2 Evolution of Life Forms - A\n\nTheory\n\n7.3 What are the Evidences\n\nfor Evolution?\n\n7.4 What is Adaptive\n\nRadiation?\n\n7.5 Biological Evolution\n\n7.6 Mechanism of Evolution\n\n7.7 Hardy - Weinberg\n\nPrinciple\n\n7.8 A Brief Account of\n\nEvolution\n\n7.9 Origin and Evolution of\n\nMan\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n127\n\nEVOLUTION\n\nold – almost 20 billion years old. Huge clusters of galaxies comprise the\n\nuniverse. Galaxies contain stars and clouds of gas and dust. Considering\n\nthe size of universe, earth is indeed a speck. The Big Bang theory attempts\n\nto explain to us the origin of universe. It talks of a singular huge explosion\n\nunimaginable in physical terms. The universe expanded and hence, the\n\ntemperature came down. Hydrogen and Helium formed sometime later.\n\nThe gases condensed under gravitation and formed the galaxies of the\n\npresent day universe. In the solar system of the milky way galaxy, earth\n\nwas supposed to have been formed about 4.5 billion years back. There\n\nwas no atmosphere on early earth. Water vapour, methane, carbondioxide\n\nand ammonia released from molten mass covered the surface. The UV rays\n\nfrom the sun brokeup water into Hydrogen and Oxygen and the lighter H\n2\n\nescaped. Oxygen combined with ammonia and methane to form water,\n\nCO\n2\n and others. The ozone layer was formed. As it cooled, the water vapor\n\nfell as rain, to fill all the depressions and form oceans. Life appeared 500\n\nmillion years after the formation of earth, i.e., almost four billion years back.\n\nDid life come from outerspace? Some scientists believe that it came\n\nfrom outside. Early Greek thinkers thought units of life called spores\n\nwere transferred to different planets including earth. ‘Panspermia’ is still\n\na favourite idea for some astronomers. For a long time it was also believed\n\nthat life came out of decaying and rotting matter like straw, mud, etc.\n\nThis was the theory of spontaneous generation. Louis Pasteur by careful\n\nexperimentation demonstrated that life comes only from pre-existing life.\n\nHe showed that in pre-sterilised flasks, life did not come from killed yeast\n\nwhile in another flask open to air, new living organisms arose from ‘killed\n\nyeast’. Spontaneous generation theory was dismissed once and for all.\n\nHowever, this did not answer how the first life form came on earth.\n\nOparin of Russia and Haldane of England proposed that the first form\n\nof life could have come from pre-existing non-living organic molecules\n\n(e.g. RNA, protein, etc.) and that formation of life was preceded by chemical\n\nevolution, i.e., formation of diverse organic molecules from inorganic\n\nconstituents. The conditions on earth were – high temperature, volcanic\n\nstorms, reducing atmosphere containing CH\n4\n, NH\n\n3\n, etc. In 1953, S.L. Miller,\n\nan American scientist created similar conditions in a laboratory scale\n\n(Figure 7.1). He created electric discharge in a closed flask containing\n\nCH\n4\n, H\n\n2\n, NH\n\n3\n and water vapour at 8000C. He observed formation of amino\n\nacids. In similar experiments others observed, formation of sugars,\n\nnitrogen bases, pigment and fats. Analysis of meteorite content also\n\nrevealed similar compounds indicating that similar processes are\n\noccurring elsewhere in space. With this limited evidence, the first part of\n\nthe conjectured story, i.e., chemical evolution was more or less accepted.\n\nWe have no idea about how the first self replicating metabolic capsule\n\nof life arose. The first non-cellular forms of life could have originated\n\n3 billion years back. They would have been giant molecules (RNA, Protein,\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n128\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nPolysaccharides, etc.). These capsules reproduced their molecules perhaps.\n\nThe first cellular form of life did not possibly originate till about 2000\n\nmillion years ago. These were probably single-cells. All life forms were in\n\nwater environment only. This version of a biogenesis, i.e., the first form of\n\nlife arose slowly through evolutionary forces from non-living molecules is\n\naccepted by majority. However, once formed, how the first cellular forms\n\nof life could have evolved into the complex biodiversity of today is the\n\nfascinating story that will be discussed below.\n\n7.2 EVOLUTION OF LIFE FORMS – A THEORY\n\nConventional religious literature tells us about the theory of special\n\ncreation. This theory has three connotations. One, that all living organisms\n\n(species or types) that we see today were created as such. Two, that the\n\ndiversity was always the same since creation and will be the same in future\n\nalso. Three, that earth is about 4000 years old. All these ideas were\n\nstrongly challenged during the nineteenth century. Based on observations\n\nmade during a sea voyage in a sail ship called H.M.S. Beagle round the\n\nworld, Charles Darwin concluded that existing living forms share\n\nsimilarities to varying degrees not only among themselves but also with\n\nlife forms that existed millions of years ago. Many such life forms do not\n\nexist any more. There had been extinctions of different life forms in the\n\nyears gone by just as new forms of life arose at different periods of history\n\nof earth. There has been gradual evolution of life forms. Any population\n\nFigure 7.1 Diagrammatic representation of Miller’s\nexperiment\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n129\n\nEVOLUTION\n\nhas built in variation in characteristics. Those characteristics which enable\n\nsome to survive better in natural conditions (climate, food, physical factors,\n\netc.) would outbreed others that are less-endowed to survive under such\n\nnatural conditions. Another word used is fitness of the individual or\n\npopulation. The fitness, according to Darwin, refers ultimately and only\n\nto reproductive fitness. Hence, those who are better fit in an environment,\n\nleave more progeny than others. These, therefore, will survive more and\n\nhence are selected by nature. He called it natural selection and implied it\n\nas a mechanism of evolution. Let us also remember that Alfred Wallace, a\n\nnaturalist who worked in Malay Archipelago had also come to similar\n\nconclusions around the same time. In due course of time, apparently new\n\ntypes of organisms are recognisable. All the existing life forms share\n\nsimilarities and share common ancestors. However, these ancestors were\n\npresent at different periods in the history of earth (epochs, periods and\n\neras). The geological history of earth closely correlates with the biological\n\nhistory of earth. A common permissible conclusion is that earth is very\n\nold, not thousand of years as was thought earlier but billions of years old.\n\n7.3 WHAT ARE THE EVIDENCES FOR EVOLUTION?\n\nEvidence that evolution of life forms has indeed taken place on earth has\n\ncome from many quarters. Fossils are remains of hard parts of\n\nlife-forms found in rocks. Rocks form sediments and a cross-section of\n\nearth's crust indicates the arrangement of sediments one over the other\n\nduring the long history of earth. Different-aged rock sediments contain\n\nfossils of different life-forms who probably died during the formation of\n\nthe particular sediment. Some of them appear similar to modern\n\norganisms (Figure 7.2). They represent extinct organisms (e.g., Dinosaurs).\n\nA study of fossils in different sedimentary layers indicates the geological\n\nperiod in which they existed.  The study showed that life-forms varied\n\nover time and certain life forms are restricted to certain geological time-\n\nspans. Hence, new forms of life have arisen at different times in the history\n\nof earth.  All this is called paleontological evidence. Do you remember\n\nhow the ages of the fossils are calculated? Do you recollect the method\n\nof radioactive-dating and the principles behind the procedure?\n\nEmbryological support for evolution was also proposed by Ernst\n\nHeckel based upon the observation of certain features during embryonic\n\nstage common to all vertebrates that are absent in adult. For example,\n\nthe embryos of all vertebrates including human develop a row of vestigial\n\ngill slit just behind the head but it is a functional organ only in fish and\n\nnot found in any other adult vertebrates. However, this proposal was\n\ndisapproved on careful study performed by Karl Ernst von Baer. He noted\n\nthat embryos never pass through the adult stages of other animals.\n\nComparative anatomy and morphology shows similarities and\n\ndifferences among organisms of today and those that existed years ago.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n130\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nFigure 7.2 A family tree of dinosaurs and their living modern day counterpart organisms like\ncrocodiles and birds\n\nSuch similarities can be interpreted to understand whether common\n\nancestors were shared or not. For example whales, bats, Cheetah and\n\nhuman (all mammals) share similarities in the pattern of bones of forelimbs\n\n(Figure 7.3b).  Though these forelimbs perform different functions in these\n\nanimals, they have similar anatomical structure – all of them have\n\nhumerus, radius, ulna, carpals, metacarpals and phalanges in their\n\nforelimbs. Hence, in these animals, the same structure developed along\n\ndifferent directions due to adaptations to different needs.  This is divergent\n\nevolution and these structures are homologous.  Homology indicates\n\ncommon ancestry.  Other examples are vertebrate hearts or brains. In\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n131\n\nEVOLUTION\n\nplants also, the thorn and tendrils of\n\nBougainvillea and Cucurbita represent\n\nhomology (Figure 7.3a). Homology is\n\nbased on divergent evolution whereas\n\nanalogy refers to a situation exactly\n\nopposite. Wings of butterfly and of birds\n\nlook alike. They are not anatomically\n\nsimilar structures though they perform\n\nsimilar functions.  Hence, analogous\n\nstructures are a result of convergent\n\nevolution - different structures evolving\n\nfor the same function and hence having\n\nsimilarity. Other examples of analogy are\n\nthe eye of the octopus and of mammals\n\nor the flippers of Penguins and Dolphins.\n\nOne can say that it is the similar habitat\n\nthat has resulted in selection of similar\n\nadaptive features in different groups of\n\norganisms but toward the same function:\n\nSweet potato (root modification) and\n\npotato (stem modification) is another\n\nexample for analogy.\n\nIn the same line of argument,\n\nsimilarities in proteins and genes\n\nperforming a given function among diverse\n\norganisms give clues to common ancestry.\n\nThese biochemical similarities point to the\n\nsame shared ancestry as structural\n\nsimilarities among diverse organisms.\n\nMan has bred selected plants and\n\nanimals for agriculture, horticulture, sport\n\nor security. Man has domesticated many\n\nwild animals and crops. This intensive\n\nbreeding programme has created breeds\n\nthat differ from other breeds (e.g., dogs) but\n\nstill are of the same group. It is argued that\n\nif within hundreds of years, man could create new breeds, could not nature\n\nhave done the same over millions of years?\n\nAnother interesting observation supporting evolution by natural\n\nselection comes from England. In a collection of moths made in 1850s,\n\ni.e., before industrialisation set in, it was observed that there were more\n\nwhite-winged moths on trees than dark-winged or melanised moths.\n\nHowever, in the collection carried out from the same area, but after\n\nindustrialisation, i.e., in 1920, there were more dark-winged moths in\n\nthe same area, i.e., the proportion was reversed.\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 7.3 Example of homologous organs in\n(a) Plants and (b) Animals\n\n(a)\n\nTendril\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n132\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nThe explanation put forth for this observation was that ‘predators will\n\nspot a moth against a contrasting background’. During post-\n\nindustrialisation period, the tree trunks became dark due to industrial\n\nsmoke and soots. Under this condition the white-winged moth did not\n\nsurvive due to predators, dark-winged or melanised moth survived. Before\n\nindustrialisation set in, thick growth of almost white-coloured lichen\n\ncovered the trees - in that background the white winged moth survived\n\nbut the dark-coloured moth were picked out by predators. Do you know\n\nthat lichens can be used as industrial pollution indicators? They will\n\nnot grow in areas that are polluted.  Hence, moths that were able to\n\ncamouflage themselves, i.e., hide in the background, survived\n\n(Figure 7.4). This understanding is supported by the fact that in areas\n\nwhere industrialisation did not occur e.g., in rural areas, the count of\n\nmelanic moths was low. This showed that in a mixed population, those\n\nthat can better-adapt, survive and increase in population size. Remember\n\nthat no variant is completely wiped out.\n\nSimilarly, excess use of herbicides, pesticides, etc., has only resulted in\n\nselection of resistant varieties in a much lesser time scale. This is also true for\n\nmicrobes against which we employ antibiotics or drugs against eukaryotic\n\norganisms/cell. Hence, resistant organisms/cells are appearing in a time\n\nscale of months or years and not centuries. These are examples of evolution\n\nby anthropogenic action. This also tells us that evolution is not a directed\n\nprocess in the sense of determinism.  It is a stochastic process based on\n\nchance events in nature and chance mutation in the organisms.\n\n7.4 WHAT IS ADAPTIVE RADIATION?\n\nDuring his journey Darwin went to Galapagos Islands. There he observed\n\nan amazing diversity of creatures. Of particular interest, small black birds\n\nlater called Darwin’s Finches amazed him. He realised that there were many\n\nFigure 7.4 Figure showing white - winged moth and dark - winged moth (melanised)\non a tree trunk (a) In unpolluted area (b) In polluted area\n\n(a) (b)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n133\n\nEVOLUTION\n\nvarieties of finches in the same island. All the varieties, he conjectured,\n\nevolved on the island itself. From the original seed-eating features, many\n\nother forms with altered beaks arose, enabling them to become insectivorous\n\nand vegetarian finches (Figure 7.5). This process of evolution of different\n\nspecies in a given geographical area starting from a point and literally\n\nradiating to other areas of geography (habitats) is called adaptive radiation.\n\nDarwin’s finches represent one of the best examples of this phenomenon.\n\nAnother example is Australian marsupials. A number of marsupials, each\n\ndifferent from the other (Figure 7.6) evolved from an ancestral stock, but all\n\nwithin the Australian island continent. When more than one adaptive radiation\n\nappeared to have occurred in an isolated geographical area (representing\n\nFigure 7.6  Adaptive radiation of marsupials of Australia\n\nFigure 7.5 Variety of beaks of finches that Darwin found in Galapagos Island\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n134\n\nBIOLOGY\n\ndifferent habitats), one can call this convergent\n\nevolution. Placental mammals in Australia also\n\nexhibit adaptive radiation in evolving into\n\nvarieties of such placental mammals each of\n\nwhich appears to be ‘similar’ to a corresponding\n\nmarsupial (e.g., Placental wolf and Tasmanian\n\nwolf-marsupial). (Figure 7.7).\n\n7.5 BIOLOGICAL EVOLUTION\n\nEvolution by natural selection, in a true sense\n\nwould have started when cellular forms of life\n\nwith differences in metabolic capability\n\noriginated on earth.\n\nThe essence of Darwinian theory about\n\nevolution is natural selection. The rate of\n\nappearance of new forms is linked to the life cycle\n\nor the life span. Microbes that divide fast have\n\nthe ability to multiply and become millions of\n\nindividuals within hours. A colony of bacteria\n\n(say A) growing on a given medium has built-in\n\nvariation in terms of ability to utilise a feed\n\ncomponent. A change in the medium\n\ncomposition would bring out only that part of\n\nthe population (say B) that can survive under\n\nthe new conditions. In due course of time this\n\nvariant population outgrows the others and\n\nappears as new species. This would happen\n\nwithin days. For the same thing to happen in a\n\nfish or fowl would take million of years as life\n\nspans of these animals are in years. Here we say\n\nthat fitness of B is better than that of A under\n\nthe new conditions. Nature selects for fitness.\n\nOne must remember that the so-called fitness is\n\nbased on characteristics which are inherited.\n\nHence, there must be a genetic basis for getting selected and to evolve.\n\nAnother way of saying the same thing is that some organisms are better\n\nadapted to survive in an otherwise hostile environment. Adaptive ability is\n\ninherited. It has a genetic basis. Fitness is the end result of the ability to\n\nadapt and get selected by nature.\n\nBranching descent and natural selection are the two key concepts\n\nof Darwinian Theory of Evolution (Figures 7.7 and 7.8).\n\nEven before Darwin, a French naturalist Lamarck had said that\n\nevolution of life forms had occurred but driven by use and disuse of\n\nFigure 7.7 Picture showing convergent evolution\nof Australian Marsupials and\nplacental mammals\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n135\n\nEVOLUTION\n\norgans. He gave the examples of Giraffes who in an attempt to forage\n\nleaves on tall trees had to adapt by elongation of their necks. As they\n\npassed on this acquired character of elongated neck to succeeding\n\ngenerations, Giraffes, slowly, over the years, came to acquire long necks.\n\nNobody believes this conjecture any more.\n\nIs evolution a process or the result of a process?  The world we see,\n\ninanimate and animate, is only the success stories of evolution. When we\n\ndescribe the story of this world we describe evolution as a process. On the\n\nother hand when we describe the story of life on earth, we treat evolution\n\nas a consequence of a process called natural selection. We are still not\n\nvery clear whether to regard evolution and natural selection as processes\n\nor end result of unknown processes.\n\nIt is possible that the work of Thomas Malthus on populations\n\ninfluenced Darwin. Natural selection is based on certain observations\n\nwhich are factual. For example, natural resources are limited, populations\n\nare stable in size except for seasonal fluctuation, members of a population\n\nvary in characteristics (infact no two individuals are alike) even though\n\nthey look superficially similar, most of variations are inherited etc. The\n\nfact that theoretically population size will grow exponentially if everybody\n\nreproduced maximally (this fact can be seen in a growing bacterial\n\npopulation) and the fact that population sizes in reality are limited, means\n\nthat there had been competition for resources. Only some survived and\n\ngrew at the cost of others that could not flourish. The novelty and brilliant\n\ninsight of Darwin was this: he asserted that variations, which are heritable\n\nand which make resource utilisation better for few (adapted to habitat\n\nbetter) will enable only those to reproduce and leave more progeny. Hence\n\nfor a period of time, over many generations, survivors will leave more\n\nprogeny and there would be a change in population characteristic and\n\nhence new forms appear to arise.\n\n7.6 MECHANISM OF EVOLUTION\n\nWhat is the origin of this variation and how does speciation occur? Even\n\nthough Mendel had talked of inheritable 'factors' influencing phenotype,\n\nDarwin either ignored these observations or kept silence. In the first decade\n\nof twentieth century, Hugo deVries based on his work on evening primrose\n\nbrought forth the idea of mutations – large difference arising suddenly in\n\na population. He believed that it is mutation which causes evolution and\n\nnot the minor variations (heritable) that Darwin talked about. Mutations\n\nare random and directionless while Darwinian variations are small and\n\ndirectional. Evolution for Darwin was gradual while deVries believed\n\nmutation caused speciation and hence called it saltation (single step\n\nlarge mutation). Studies in population genetics, later, brought out\n\nsome clarity.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n136\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nFigure 7.8 Diagrammatic representation of the operation of natural selection on different\ntraits : (a) Stabilising (b) Directional and (c) Disruptive\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n7.7 HARDY-WEINBERG PRINCIPLE\n\nIn a given population one can find out the frequency of occurrence of\n\nalleles of a gene or a locus. This frequency is supposed to remain fixed\n\nand even remain the same through generations. Hardy-Weinberg principle\n\nstated it using algebraic equations.\n\nThis principle says that allele frequencies in a population are stable\n\nand is constant from generation to generation. The gene pool (total genes\n\nand their alleles in a population) remains a constant. This is called\n\ngenetic equilibrium. Sum total of all the allelic frequencies is 1. Individual\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n137\n\nEVOLUTION\n\nfrequencies, for example, can be named p, q, etc. In a diploid, p and q\n\nrepresent the frequency of allele A and allele a . The frequency of AA\n\nindividuals in a population is simply p2.  This is simply stated in another\n\nways, i.e., the probability that an allele A with a frequency of p appear on\n\nboth the chromosomes of a diploid individual is simply the product\n\nof the probabilities, i.e., p2. Similarly of aa is q2, of Aa 2pq. Hence,\n\np2+2pq+q2=1. This is a binomial expansion of (p+q)2. When frequency\n\nmeasured, differs from expected values, the difference (direction) indicates\n\nthe extent of evolutionary change. Disturbance in genetic equilibrium, or\n\nHardy- Weinberg equilibrium, i.e., change of frequency of alleles in a\n\npopulation would then be interpreted as resulting in evolution.\n\nFive factors are known to affect Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. These\n\nare gene migration or gene flow, genetic drift, mutation, genetic\n\nrecombination and natural selection. When migration of a section of\n\npopulation to another place and population occurs, gene frequencies\n\nchange in the original as well as in the new population. New genes/alleles\n\nare added to the new population and these are lost from the old population.\n\nThere would be a gene flow if this gene migration, happens multiple times.\n\nIf the same change occurs by chance, it is called genetic drift. Sometimes\n\nthe change in allele frequency is so different in the new sample of population\n\nthat they become a different species. The original drifted population\n\nbecomes founders and the effect is called founder effect.\n\nMicrobial experiments show that pre-existing advantageous\n\nmutations when selected will result in observation of new phenotypes.\n\nOver few generations, this would result in Speciation. Natural selection is\n\na process in which heritable variations enabling better survival are enabled\n\nto reproduce and leave greater number of progeny. A critical analysis\n\nmakes us believe that variation due to mutation or variation due to\n\nrecombination during gametogenesis, or due to gene flow or genetic drift\n\nresults in changed frequency of genes and alleles in future generation.\n\nCoupled to enhance reproductive success, natural selection makes it look\n\nlike different population. Natural selection can lead to stabilisation (in\n\nwhich more individuals acquire mean character value), directional change\n\n(more individuals acquire value other than the mean character value) or\n\ndisruption (more individuals acquire peripheral character value at both\n\nends of the distribution curve) (Figure 7.8).\n\n7.8 A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF EVOLUTION\n\nAbout 2000 million years ago (mya) the first cellular forms of life appeared\n\non earth. The mechanism of how non-cellular aggregates of giant\n\nmacromolecules could evolve into cells with membranous envelop is not\n\nknown. Some of these cells had the ability to release O\n2\n. The reaction\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n138\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nFigure 7.9  A sketch of the evolution of plant forms through geological periods\n\ncould have been similar to the light reaction in photosynthesis where water\n\nis split with the help of solar energy captured and channelised by\n\nappropriate light harvesting pigments. Slowly single-celled organisms\n\nbecame multi-cellular life forms. By the time of 500 mya, invertebrates\n\nwere formed and active. Jawless fish probably evolved around 350 mya.\n\nSea weeds and few plants existed probably around 320 mya.  We are told\n\nthat the first organisms that invaded land were plants. They were\n\nwidespread on land when animals invaded land. Fish with stout and strong\n\nfins could move on land and go back to water. This was about 350 mya. In\n\n1938, a fish caught in South Africa happened to be a Coelacanth which was\n\nthought to be extinct. These animals called lobefins evolved into the\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n139\n\nEVOLUTION\n\nfirst amphibians that lived on both land and water. There are no specimens\n\nof these left with us. However, these were ancestors of modern day frogs\n\nand salamanders. The amphibians evolved into reptiles. They lay thick-\n\nshelled eggs which do not dry up in sun unlike those of amphibians.\n\nAgain we only see their modern day descendents, the turtles, tortoises\n\nand crocodiles. In the next 200 millions years or so, reptiles of different\n\nFigure 7.10 Representative evolutionary history of vertebrates through geological periods\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n140\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nshapes and sizes dominated on earth. Giant ferns (pteridophytes) were\n\npresent but they all fell to form coal deposits slowly. Some of these land\n\nreptiles went back into water to evolve into fish like reptiles probably 200\n\nmya (e.g. Ichthyosaurs). The land reptiles were, of course, the dinosaurs.\n\nThe biggest of them, i.e., Tyrannosaurus rex was about 20 feet in height\n\nand had huge fearsome dagger like teeth. About 65 mya, the dinosaurs\n\nsuddenly disappeared from the earth. We do not know the true reason.\n\nSome say climatic changes killed them. Some say most of them evolved\n\ninto birds. The truth may live in between. Small sized reptiles of  that era\n\nstill exist today.\n\nThe first mammals were like shrews. Their fossils are small sized.\n\nMammals were viviparous and protected their unborn young inside the\n\nmother’s body. Mammals were more intelligent in sensing and avoiding\n\ndanger at least. When reptiles came down mammals took over this earth.\n\nThere were in South America mammals resembling horse, hippopotamus,\n\nbear, rabbit, etc. Due to continental drift, when South America joined\n\nNorth America, these animals were overridden by North American fauna.\n\nDue to the same continental drift pouched mammals of Australia survived\n\nbecause of lack of competition from any other mammal.\n\nLest we forget, some mammals live wholly in water. Whales, dolphins,\n\nseals and sea cows are some examples. Evolution of horse, elephant, dog,\n\netc., are special stories of evolution. You will learn about these in higher\n\nclasses. The most successful story is the evolution of man with language\n\nskills and self-consciousness.\n\nA rough sketch of the evolution of life forms, their times on a geological\n\nscale are indicated in (Figure 7.9 and 7.10).\n\n7.9 ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF MAN\n\nAbout 15 mya, primates called Dryopithecus and Ramapithecus were\n\nexisting. They were hairy and walked like gorillas and chimpanzees.\n\nRamapithecus was more man-like while Dryopithecus was more\n\nape-like. Few fossils of man-like bones have been discovered in Ethiopia\n\nand Tanzania (Figure 7.11). These revealed hominid features leading to\n\nthe belief that about 3-4 mya, man-like primates walked in eastern Africa.\n\nThey were probably not taller than 4 feet but walked up right. Two mya,\n\nAustralopithecines probably lived in East African grasslands. Evidence\n\nshows they hunted with stone weapons but essentially ate fruit. Some of\n\nthe bones among the bones discovered were different. This creature was\n\ncalled the first human-like being the hominid and was called Homo habilis.\n\nThe brain capacities were between 650-800cc. They probably did not eat\n\nmeat. Fossils discovered in Java in 1891 revealed the next stage, i.e., Homo\n\nerectus about 1.5 mya. Homo erectus had a large brain around 900cc.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n141\n\nEVOLUTION\n\nFigure 7.11 A comparison of the skulls of adult modern human being, baby chimpanzee and\nadult chimpanzee.

The Neanderthal man with a brain size\n\nof 1400cc lived in near east and central Asia between 1,00,000-40,000\n\nyears back. They used hides to protect their body and buried their dead.\n\nHomo sapiens arose in Africa and moved across continents and developed\n\ninto distinct races. During ice age between 75,000-10,000 years ago\n\nmodern Homo sapiens arose. Pre-historic cave art developed about\n\n18,000 years ago. One such cave paintings by Pre-historic humans can\n\nbe seen at Bhimbetka rock shelter in Raisen district of Madhya Pradesh.\n\nAgriculture came around 10,000 years back and human settlements\n\nstarted. The rest of what happened is part of human history of growth\n\nand decline of civilisations.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n142\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1.

Most scientists\nbelieve chemical evolution, i.e., formation of biomolecules preceded\nthe appearance of the first cellular forms of life. The subsequent events\nas to what happened to the first form of life is a conjectured story\nbased on Darwinian ideas of organic evolution by natural selection.\nDiversity of life forms on earth has been changing over millions of\nyears. It is generally believed that variations in a population result in\nvariable fitness. Other phenomena like habitat fragmentation and\ngenetic drift may accentuate these variations leading to appearance\nof new species and hence evolution. Homology is accounted for by the\nidea of branching descent. Study of comparative anatomy, fossils  and\ncomparative  biochemistry provides evidence for evolution. Among the\nstories of evolution of individual  species, the story of evolution of\nmodern man is most interesting and appears to parallel evolution of\nhuman brain and language.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman Welfare.pmd\n\n\nChapter 8\n\nHuman Health and Disease\n\nChapter 9\n\nStrategies for Enhancement in\n\nFood Production\n\nChapter 10\n\nMicrobes in Human Welfare\n\nBiology is the youngest of the formalised disciplines of natural\n\nscience. Progress in physics and chemistry proceeded much\n\nfaster than in Biology. Applications of physics and chemistry in\n\nour daily life also have a higher visibility than those of biology.\n\nHowever, twentieth century and certainly twenty-first century\n\nhas demonstrated the utility of biological knowledge in\n\nfurthering human welfare, be it in health sector or agriculture.\n\nThe discovery of antibiotics, and synthetic plant-derived drugs,\n\nanaesthetics have changed medical practice on one hand\n\nand human health on the other hand. Life expectancy of\n\nhuman beings have dramatically changed over the years.\n\nAgricultural practices, food processing and diagnostics have\n\nbrought socio-cultural changes in human communities. These\n\nare briefly described in the following three chapters of this unit.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nBorn in August 1925 in Kumbakonam in Tamil Nadu, Monkambu Sambasivan\n\nSwaminathan did his graduation and post-graduation in Botany from\n\nMadras University. He worked in different capacities in large number of\n\ninstitutions in India and abroad and developed his expertise in genetics\n\nand plant breeding.\n\nThe School of Cytogenetics and Radiation Research established at the\n\nIndian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) enabled Swaminathan and his\n\nteam to develop short-duration high-yielding varieties of rice including scented\n\nBasmati. He is also known for the development of the concept of crop\n\ncafeteria, crop scheduling and genetically improving the yield and quality.\n\nSwaminathan initiated collaboration with Norman Borlaug, which\n\nculminated in the ‘Green Revolution’ through introduction of Mexican\n\nvarieties of wheat in India. This was highly recognised and appreciated. He\n\nis also the initiator of ‘Lab-to-Land’, food security and several other\n\nenvironmental programmes. He has been honoured with Padma Bhushan\n\nand several other prestigious awards, medals and fellowships by institutions\n\nof excellence.\n\nM.S. SWAMINATHAN\n(1925)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nHealth, for a long time, was considered as a state of body\n\nand mind where there was a balance of certain ‘humors’.\n\nThis is what early Greeks like Hippocrates as well as\n\nIndian Ayurveda system of medicine asserted. It was\n\nthought that persons with ‘blackbile’ belonged to hot\n\npersonality and would have fevers. This idea was arrived\n\nat by pure reflective thought. The discovery of blood\n\ncirculation by William Harvey using experimental method\n\nand the demonstration of normal body temperature in\n\npersons with blackbile using thermometer disproved the\n\n‘good humor’ hypothesis of health. In later years, biology\n\nstated that mind influences, through neural system and\n\nendocrine system, our immune system and that our\n\nimmune system maintains our health. Hence, mind and\n\nmental state can affect our health. Of course, health is\n\naffected by –\n\n(i) genetic disorders – deficiencies with which a child is\n\nborn and deficiencies/defects which the child inherits\n\nfrom parents from birth;\n\n(ii) infections  and\n\n(iii) life style including food and water we take, rest and\n\nexercise we give to our bodies, habits that we have or\n\nlack etc.\n\nCHAPTER 8\n\nHUMAN HEALTH AND DISEASE\n\n8.1 Common Diseases in\n\nHumans\n\n8.2 Immunity\n\n8.3 AIDS\n\n8.4 Cancer\n\n8.5 Drugs and Alcohol Abuse\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n146\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nThe term health is very frequently used by everybody. How do we\n\ndefine it? Health does not simply mean ‘absence of disease’ or ‘physical\n\nfitness’. It could be defined as a state of complete physical, mental and\n\nsocial well-being. When people are healthy, they are more efficient at\n\nwork. This increases productivity and brings economic prosperity. Health\n\nalso increases longevity of people and reduces infant and maternal\n\nmortality.\n\nBalanced diet, personal hygiene and regular exercise are very important\n\nto maintain good health. Yoga has been practised since time immemorial\n\nto achieve physical and mental health. Awareness about diseases and\n\ntheir effect on different bodily functions, vaccination (immunisation)\n\nagainst infectious diseases, proper disposal of wastes, control of vectors\n\nand maintenance of hygiene in food and water resources are necessary\n\nfor achieving good health.\n\nWhen the functioning of one or more organs or systems of the body is\n\nadversely affected, characterised by appearance of various signs and\n\nsymptoms, we say that we are not healthy, i.e., we have a disease. Diseases\n\ncan be broadly grouped into infectious and non-infectious. Diseases\n\nwhich are easily transmitted from one person to another, are called\n\ninfectious diseases.  Infectious diseases are very common and every\n\none of us suffers from these at sometime or other. Some of the infectious\n\ndiseases like AIDS are fatal. Among non-infectious diseases, cancer is the\n\nmajor cause of death. Drug and alcohol abuse also affect our health adversely.\n\n8.1 COMMON DISEASES IN HUMANS\n\nA wide range of organisms belonging to bacteria, viruses, fungi,\n\nprotozoans, helminths, etc., could cause diseases in man. Such disease-\n\ncausing organisms are called pathogens. Most parasites are therefore\n\npathogens as they cause harm to the host by living in (or on) them. The\n\npathogens can enter our body by various means, multiply  and interfere\n\nwith normal vital activities, resulting in morphological and functional\n\ndamage. Pathogens have to adapt to life within the environment of the\n\nhost. For example, the pathogens that enter the gut must know a way of\n\nsurviving in the stomach at low pH and resisting the various digestive\n\nenzymes. A few representative members from different groups of\n\npathogenic organisms are discussed here alongwith the diseases caused\n\nby them. Preventive and control measures against these diseases in general,\n\nare also briefly described.\n\nSalmonella typhi is a pathogenic bacterium which causes typhoid\n\nfever in human beings. These pathogens generally enter the small intestine\n\nthrough food and water contaminated with them and migrate to other\n\norgans through blood. Sustained high fever (39° to 40°C), weakness,\n\nstomach pain, constipation, headache and loss of appetite are some of\n\nthe  common symptoms of this disease. Intestinal perforation and death\n\nmay occur in severe cases. Typhoid fever could be confirmed by\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nHUMAN HEALTH AND DISEASE\n\n147\n\nWidal test : A classic case in medicine, that of Mary Mallon nicknamed\n\nTyphoid Mary, is worth mentioning here. She was a cook by profession\n\nand  was a typhoid carrier who continued to spread typhoid for several\n\nyears through the food she prepared.\n\nBacteria like Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae\n\nare responsible for the disease pneumonia in humans which infects the\n\nalveoli (air filled sacs) of the lungs. As a result of the infection, the alveoli\n\nget filled with fluid leading to severe problems in respiration. The symptoms\n\nof pneumonia include fever, chills, cough and headache. In severe cases,\n\nthe lips and finger nails may turn gray to bluish in colour.  A healthy\n\nperson acquires the infection by inhaling the droplets/aerosols released\n\nby an infected person or even by sharing glasses and utensils with an\n\ninfected person.  Dysentery, plague, diphtheria, etc., are some of the other\n\nbacterial diseases in man.\n\nMany viruses also cause diseases in human beings. Rhino viruses\n\nrepresent one such group of viruses which cause one of the most infectious\n\nhuman ailments – the common cold.  They infect the nose and respiratory\n\npassage but not the lungs. The common cold is characterised by nasal\n\ncongestion and discharge, sore throat, hoarseness, cough, headache,\n\ntiredness, etc., which usually last for 3-7 days. Droplets resulting from\n\ncough or sneezes of an infected person are either inhaled directly or\n\ntransmitted through contaminated objects such as pens, books, cups,\n\ndoorknobs, computer keyboard or mouse, etc., and cause infection in a\n\nhealthy person.\n\nSome of the human diseases are caused by protozoans too. You might\n\nhave heard about malaria, a disease man has been fighting since many\n\nyears. Plasmodium, a tiny protozoan is responsible for this disease. Different\n\nspecies of Plasmodium (P. vivax, P. malaria and P. falciparum) are\n\nresponsible for different types of malaria. Of these, malignant malaria caused\n\nby Plasmodium falciparum is the most serious one and can even be fatal.\n\nLet us take a glance at the life cycle of Plasmodium (Figure 8.1).\n\nPlasmodium enters the human body as sporozoites (infectious form)\n\nthrough the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquito. The parasites\n\ninitially multiply within the liver cells and then attack the red blood cells\n\n(RBCs) resulting in their rupture. The rupture of RBCs is associated with\n\nrelease of a toxic substance, haemozoin, which is responsible for the chill\n\nand high fever recurring every three to four days. When a female Anopheles\n\nmosquito bites an infected person, these parasites enter the mosquito’s\n\nbody and undergo further development. The parasites multiply within\n\nthem to form sporozoites that are stored in their salivary glands. When\n\nthese mosquitoes bite a human, the sporozoites are introduced into his/\n\nher body, thereby initiating the events mentioned above. It is interesting\n\nto note that the malarial parasite requires two hosts – human and\n\nmosquitoes – to complete its life cycle (Figure 8.1); the female Anopheles\n\nmosquito is the vector (transmitting agent) too.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n148\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nEntamoeba histolytica is a protozoan parasite in the large intestine of\n\nhuman which causes amoebiasis (amoebic dysentery). Symptoms  of\n\nthis disease include constipation, abdominal pain and cramps, stools\n\nwith excess mucous and blood clots. Houseflies act as mechanical carriers\n\nand serve to transmit the parasite from faeces of infected person to food\n\nFigure 8.1 Stages in the life cycle of Plasmodium\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nHUMAN HEALTH AND DISEASE\n\n149\n\nand food products, thereby contaminating them.\n\nDrinking water and food contaminated by the faecal\n\nmatter are the main source of infection.\n\nAscaris, the common round worm and Wuchereria,\n\nthe filarial worm, are some of the helminths which are\n\nknown to be pathogenic to man. Ascaris, an intestinal\n\nparasite causes ascariasis. Symptoms of these disease\n\ninclude internal bleeding, muscular pain, fever, anemia\n\nand blockage of the intestinal passage. The eggs of the\n\nparasite are excreted along with the faeces of infected\n\npersons which contaminate soil, water, plants, etc. A\n\nhealthy person acquires this infection through\n\ncontaminated water, vegetables, fruits, etc.\n\nWuchereria (W. bancrofti and W. malayi), the filarial\n\nworms cause a slowly developing chronic inflammation\n\nof the organs in which they live for many years, usually\n\nthe lymphatic vessels of the lower limbs and the disease\n\nis called elephantiasis or filariasis (Figure 8.2). The\n\ngenital organs are also often affected, resulting in gross\n\ndeformities. The pathogens are transmitted to a healthy\n\nperson through the bite by the female mosquito vectors.\n\nMany fungi belonging to the  genera Microsporum,\n\nTrichophyton and Epidermophyton are\n\nresponsible for ringworms which is one of\n\nthe most common infectious diseases in man.\n\nAppearance of dry, scaly lesions on various\n\nparts of the body such as skin, nails and\n\nscalp (Figure 8.3) are the main symptoms of\n\nthe disease.  These lesions are accompanied\n\nby intense itching. Heat and moisture help\n\nthese fungi to grow, which makes them thrive\n\nin skin folds such as those in the groin or\n\nbetween the toes. Ringworms are generally\n\nacquired from soil or by using towels, clothes\n\nor even the comb of infected individuals.\n\nFigure 8.2 Diagram showing\ninflammation in one\nof the lower limbs due\nto elephantiasis\n\nFigure 8.3 Diagram showing ringworm\naffected area of the skin\n\nMaintenance of personal and public hygiene is very important for\n\nprevention and control of many infectious diseases. Measures for personal\n\nhygiene include keeping the body clean; consumption of clean drinking\n\nwater, food, vegetables, fruits, etc. Public hygiene includes proper disposal\n\nof waste and excreta; periodic cleaning and disinfection of water reservoirs,\n\npools, cesspools and tanks and observing standard practices of hygiene\n\nin public catering. These measures are particularly essential where the\n\ninfectious agents are transmitted through food and water such as typhoid,\n\namoebiasis and ascariasis. In cases of air-borne diseases such as\n\npneumonia and common cold, in addition to the above measures, close\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n150\n\nBIOLOGY\n\ncontact with the infected persons or their belongings should be avoided.\n\nFor diseases such as malaria and filariasis that are transmitted through\n\ninsect vectors, the most important measure is to control or eliminate the\n\nvectors and their breeding places. This can be achieved by avoiding\n\nstagnation of water in and around residential areas, regular cleaning of\n\nhousehold coolers, use of mosquito nets, introducing fishes like Gambusia\n\nin ponds that feed on mosquito larvae, spraying of insecticides in ditches,\n\ndrainage areas and swamps, etc. In addition, doors and windows should\n\nbe provided with wire mesh to prevent the entry of mosquitoes. Such\n\nprecautions have become more important especially in the light of recent\n\nwidespread incidences of the vector-borne (Aedes mosquitoes) diseases\n\nlike dengue and chikungunya in many parts of India.\n\nThe advancements made in biological science have armed us to\n\neffectively deal with many infectious diseases. The use of vaccines and\n\nimmunisation programmes have enabled us to completely eradicate a\n\ndeadly disease like smallpox. A large number of other infectious diseases\n\nlike polio, diphtheria, pneumonia and tetanus have been controlled to a\n\nlarge extent by the use of vaccines. Biotechnology (about which you will\n\nread more in Chapter 12) is at the verge of making available newer and\n\nsafer vaccines. Discovery of antibiotics and various other drugs has also\n\nenabled us to effectively treat infectious diseases.\n\n8.2 IMMUNITY\n\nEveryday we are exposed to large number of infectious agents. However,\n\nonly a few of these exposures result in disease. Why?  This is due to the\n\nfact that the body is able to defend itself from most of these foreign agents.\n\nThis overall ability of the host to fight the disease-causing organisms,\n\nconferred by the immune system is called immunity.\n\nImmunity is of two types:  (i) Innate immunity  and (ii) Acquired\n\nimmunity.\n\n8.2.1 Innate Immunity\n\nInnate immunity is non-specific type of defence, that is present at the\n\ntime of birth. This is accomplished by providing different types of barriers\n\nto the entry of the foreign agents into our body. Innate immunity consist\n\nof four types of barriers. These are —\n\n(i) Physical barriers : Skin on our body is the main barrier which\n\nprevents entry of the micro-organisms. Mucus coating of the\n\nepithelium lining the respiratory, gastrointestinal and urogenital\n\ntracts also help in trapping microbes entering our body.\n\n(ii) Physiological barriers : Acid in the stomach, saliva in the mouth,\n\ntears from eyes–all prevent microbial growth.\n\n(iii) Cellular barriers : Certain types of leukocytes (WBC) of our body\n\nlike polymorpho-nuclear leukocytes (PMNL-neutrophils) and\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nHUMAN HEALTH AND DISEASE\n\n151\n\nmonocytes and natural killer (type of lymphocytes) in the blood as\n\nwell as macrophages in tissues can phagocytose and destroy\n\nmicrobes.\n\n(iv) Cytokine barriers : Virus-infected cells secrete proteins called\n\ninterferons which protect non-infected cells from further viral\n\ninfection.\n\n8.2.2 Acquired Immunity\n\nAcquired immunity, on the other hand is pathogen specific. It is\n\ncharacterised by memory. This means when our body encounters a\n\npathogen for the first time it produces a response called primary\n\nresponse which is of low intensity. Subsequent encounter with the same\n\npathogen elicits a highly intensified secondary or anamnestic response.\n\nThis is ascribed to the fact that our body appears to have memory of the\n\nfirst encounter.\n\nThe primary and secondary\n\nimmune responses are\n\ncarried out with the help\n\nof two special types of\n\nlymphocytes present in our\n\nblood, i.e., B-lymphocytes and\n\nT-lymphocytes.\n\nThe B-lymphocytes produce an\n\narmy of proteins in response to\n\npathogens into our blood to fight\n\nwith them. These proteins are\n\ncalled antibodies. The\n\nT-cells themselves do not secrete\n\nantibodies but help B cells to\n\nproduce them. Each antibody\n\nmolecule has four peptide chains,\n\ntwo small called light chains and\n\ntwo longer called heavy chains.\n\nHence, an antibody is represented\n\nas H\n2\nL\n\n2\n. Different types of antibodies are produced in our body. IgA, IgM,\n\nIgE, IgG are some of them. A cartoon of an antibody is given in Figure\n\n8.4. Because these antibodies are found in the blood, the response is also\n\ncalled as humoral immune response. This is one of the two types of\n\nour acquired immune response – antibody mediated. The second type is\n\ncalled cell-mediated immune response or cell-mediated immunity\n\n(CMI). The T-lymphocytes mediate CMI. Very often, when some human\n\norgans like heart, eye, liver, kidney fail to function satisfactorily,\n\ntransplantation is  the only remedy to enable the patient to live a normal\n\nlife. Then a search begins – to find a suitable donor. Why is it that the\n\norgans cannot be taken from just anybody? What is it that the doctors\n\nFigure 8.4 Structure of an antibody molecule\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n152\n\nBIOLOGY\n\ncheck? Grafts from just any source – an animal, another primate, or any\n\nhuman beings  cannot be made since the grafts would be rejected sooner\n\nor later. Tissue matching, blood group matching are essential before\n\nundertaking any graft/transplant and even after this the patient has to\n\ntake immuno–suppresants all his/her life. The body is able to differentiate\n\n‘self ’ and ‘nonself’ and the cell-mediated immune response is responsible\n\nfor the graft rejection.\n\n8.2.3 Active and Passive Immunity\n\nWhen a host is exposed to antigens, which may be in the form of living\n\nor dead microbes or other proteins, antibodies are produced in the host\n\nbody. This type of immunity is called active immunity. Active immunity\n\nis slow and takes time to give its full effective response. Injecting the\n\nmicrobes deliberately during immunisation or infectious organisms\n\ngaining access into body during natural infection induce active\n\nimmunity. When ready-made antibodies are directly given to protect\n\nthe body against foreign agents, it is called passive immunity. Do you\n\nknow why mother’s milk is considered very essential for the new-\n\nborn infant? The yellowish fluid colostrum secreted by mother during\n\nthe initial days of lactation has abundant antibodies (IgA) to protect the\n\ninfant. The foetus also receives some antibodies from their mother,\n\nthrough the placenta during pregnancy.  These are some examples of\n\npassive immunity.\n\n8.2.4 Vaccination and Immunisation\n\nThe principle of immunisation or vaccination is based on the property of\n\n‘memory’ of the immune system. In vaccination, a preparation of antigenic\n\nproteins of pathogen or inactivated/weakened pathogen (vaccine) are\n\nintroduced into the body. The antibodies produced in the body against\n\nthese antigens would neutralise the pathogenic agents during actual\n\ninfection. The vaccines also generate memory – B and T-cells that recognise\n\nthe pathogen quickly on subsequent exposure and overwhelm the\n\ninvaders with a massive production of antibodies. If a person is infected\n\nwith some deadly microbes to which quick immune response is required\n\nas in tetanus, we need to directly inject the preformed antibodies, or\n\nantitoxin (a preparation containing antibodies to the toxin). Even in cases\n\nof snakebites, the injection which is given to the patients, contain preformed\n\nantibodies against the snake venom. This type of immunisation is called\n\npassive immunisation.\n\nRecombinant DNA technology has allowed the production of antigenic\n\npolypeptides of pathogen in bacteria or yeast. Vaccines produced using\n\nthis approach allow large scale production and hence greater availability\n\nfor immunisation, e.g., hepatitis B vaccine produced from yeast.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nHUMAN HEALTH AND DISEASE\n\n153\n\n8.2.5 Allergies\n\nWhen you have gone to a new place and suddenly you started sneezing,\n\nwheezing for no explained reason, and when you went away, your\n\nsymptoms dissappeared. Did this happen to you?  Some of us are sensitive\n\nto some particles in the environment. The above-mentioned reaction could\n\nbe because of allergy to pollen, mites, etc., which are different in different\n\nplaces.\n\nThe exaggerated response of the immune system to certain antigens\n\npresent in the environment is called allergy. The substances to which\n\nsuch an immune response is produced are called allergens. The antibodies\n\nproduced to these are of IgE type. Common examples of allergens are\n\nmites in dust, pollens, animal dander, etc. Symptoms of allergic reactions\n\ninclude sneezing, watery eyes, running nose and difficulty in breathing.\n\nAllergy is due to the release of chemicals like histamine and serotonin\n\nfrom the mast cells. For determining the cause of allergy, the patient is\n\nexposed to or injected with very small doses of possible allergens, and the\n\nreactions studied. The use of drugs like anti-histamine, adrenalin and\n\nsteroids quickly reduce the symptoms of allergy. Somehow, modern-day\n\nlife style has resulted in lowering of immunity and more sensitivity to\n\nallergens – more and more children in metro cities of India suffer from\n\nallergies and asthma due to sensitivity to the environment. This could be\n\nbecause of the protected environment provided early in life.\n\n8.2.6 Auto Immunity\n\nMemory-based acquired immunity evolved in higher vertebrates based\n\non the ability to differentiate foreign organisms (e.g., pathogens) from self-\n\ncells. While we still do not understand the basis of this, two corollaries of\n\nthis ability have to be understood. One, higher vertebrates can distinguish\n\nforeign molecules as well as foreign organisms. Most of the experimental\n\nimmunology deals with this aspect. Two, sometimes, due to genetic and\n\nother unknown reasons, the body attacks self-cells. This results in damage\n\nto the body and is called auto-immune disease. Rheumatoid arthritis\n\nwhich affects many people in our society is an auto-immune disease.\n\n8.2.7 Immune System in the Body\n\nThe human immune system consists of lymphoid organs, tissues, cells\n\nand soluble molecules like antibodies.  As you have read, immune system\n\nis unique in the sense that it recognises foreign antigens, responds to\n\nthese and remembers them. The immune system also plays an important\n\nrole in allergic reactions, auto-immune diseases and organ\n\ntransplantation.\n\nLymphoid organs: These are the organs where origin and/or maturation\n\nand proliferation of lymphocytes occur. The primary lymphoid organs\n\nare bone marrow and thymus where immature lymphocytes differentiate\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n154\n\nBIOLOGY\n\ninto antigen-sensitive lymphocytes. After maturation the\n\nlymphocytes migrate to secondary lymphoid organs like spleen,\n\nlymph nodes, tonsils, Peyer’s patches of small intestine and\n\nappendix. The secondary lymphoid organs provide the sites for\n\ninteraction of lymphocytes with the antigen, which then proliferate\n\nto become effector cells. The location of various lymphoid organs\n\nin the human body is shown in Figure 8.5.\n\nThe bone marrow is the main lymphoid organ where all\n\nblood cells including lymphocytes are produced. The thymus\n\nis a lobed organ located near the heart and beneath the\n\nbreastbone. The thymus is quite large at the time of birth but\n\nkeeps reducing in size with age and by the time puberty is\n\nattained it reduces to a very small size. Both bone-marrow\n\nand thymus provide micro-environments for the development\n\nand maturation of T-lymphocytes. The spleen is a large bean-\n\nshaped organ. It mainly contains lymphocytes and phagocytes.\n\nIt acts as a filter of the blood by trapping blood-borne micro-\n\norganisms. Spleen also has a large reservoir of erythrocytes.\n\nThe lymph nodes are small solid structures located at different\n\npoints along the lymphatic system. Lymph nodes serve to trap the\n\nmicro-organisms or other antigens, which happen to get into the lymph\n\nand tissue fluid. Antigens trapped in the lymph nodes are responsible for\n\nthe activation of lymphocytes present there and cause the immune\n\nresponse.\n\nThere is lymphoid tissue also located within the lining of the major\n\ntracts (respiratory, digestive and urogenital tracts) called mucosa-\n\nassociated lymphoid tissue (MALT). It constitutes about 50 per cent of\n\nthe lymphoid tissue in human body.\n\n8.3 AIDS\n\nThe word AIDS stands for Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome.\n\nThis means deficiency of immune system, acquired during the lifetime of\n\nan individual indicating that it is not a congenital disease. ‘Syndrome’\n\nmeans a group of symptoms. AIDS was first reported in 1981 and in the\n\nlast twenty-five years or so, it has spread all over the world killing more\n\nthan 25 million persons.\n\nAIDS is caused by the Human Immuno deficiency Virus (HIV), a\n\nmember of a group of viruses called retrovirus, which have an envelope\n\nenclosing the RNA genome (Figure 8.6). Transmission of HIV-infection\n\ngenerally occurs by (a) sexual contact with infected person, (b) by\n\ntransfusion of contaminated blood and blood products, (c) by sharing\n\ninfected needles as in the case of intravenous drug abusers and (d) from\n\ninfected mother to her child through placenta. So, people who are at high\n\nrisk of getting this infection includes - individuals who have multiple\n\nFigure 8.5 Diagrammatic\nrepresentation\nof Lymph nodes\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nHUMAN HEALTH AND DISEASE\n\n155\n\nFigure 8.6 Replication of retrovirus\n\nsexual partners, drug addicts who take drugs intravenously, individuals\n\nwho require repeated blood transfusions and children born to an HIV\n\ninfected mother. Do you know–when do people need repeated blood\n\ntransfusion? Find out and make a list of such conditions. It is important\n\nto note that HIV/AIDS is not spread by mere touch or physical contact; it\n\nspreads only through body fluids. It is, hence, imperative, for the physical\n\nand psychological well-being, that the HIV/AIDS infected persons are\n\nnot isolated from family and society. There is always a time-lag between\n\nthe infection and appearance of AIDS symptoms. This period may vary\n\nfrom a few months to many years  (usually 5-10 years).\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n156\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nAfter getting into the body of the person, the virus enters into macrophages\n\nwhere RNA genome of the virus replicates to form viral DNA with the help of\n\nthe enzyme reverse transcriptase. This viral DNA gets incorporated into host\n\ncell’s DNA and directs the infected cells to produce virus particles (Figure 8.6).\n\nThe macrophages continue to produce virus and in this way acts like a HIV\n\nfactory. Simultaneously, HIV enters into helper\n\nT-lymphocytes (T\nH\n), replicates and produce progeny viruses. The progeny\n\nviruses released in the blood attack other helper T-lymphocytes. This is\n\nrepeated leading to a progressive decrease in the number of helper T-\n\nlymphocytes in the body of the infected person. During this period, the person\n\nsuffers from bouts of fever, diarrhoea and weight loss. Due to decrease in\n\nthe number of helper T lymphocytes, the person starts suffering from infections\n\nthat could have been otherwise overcome such as those due to bacteria\n\nespecially Mycobacterium, viruses, fungi and even parasites like Toxoplasma.\n\nThe patient becomes so immuno-deficient that he/she is unable to protect\n\nhimself/herself against these infections. A widely used diagnostic test for\n\nAIDS is enzyme linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA). Treatment of AIDS\n\nwith anti-retroviral drugs is only partially effective. They can only prolong\n\nthe life of the patient but cannot prevent death, which is inevitable.\n\nPrevention of AIDS : As AIDS has no cure, prevention is the best option.\n\nMoreover, HIV infection, more often, spreads due to conscious behaviour\n\npatterns and is not something that happens inadvertently, like pneumonia\n\nor typhoid. Of course, infection in blood transfusion patients, new-borns\n\n(from mother) etc., may take place due to poor monitoring. The only excuse\n\nmay be ignorance and it has been rightly said – “don’t die of ignorance”.\n\nIn our country the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) and other\n\nnon-governmental organisation (NGOs) are doing a lot to educate people\n\nabout AIDS. WHO has started a number of programmes to prevent the\n\nspreading of HIV infection. Making blood (from blood banks) safe from\n\nHIV, ensuring the use of only disposable needles and syringes in public\n\nand private hospitals and clinics, free distribution of condoms, controlling\n\ndrug abuse, advocating safe sex and promoting regular check-ups for\n\nHIV in susceptible populations, are some such steps taken up.\n\nInfection with HIV or having AIDS is something that should not be\n\nhidden – since then, the infection may spread to many more people.\n\nHIV/AIDS-infected people need help and sympathy instead of being\n\nshunned by society. Unless society recognises it as a problem to be dealt\n\nwith in a collective manner – the chances of wider spread of the disease\n\nincrease manifold. It is a malady that can only be tackled, by the society\n\nand medical fraternity acting together, to prevent the spread of the disease.\n\n8.4 CANCER\n\nCancer is one of the most dreaded diseases of human beings and is a major\n\ncause of death all over the globe. More than a million Indians suffer from\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nHUMAN HEALTH AND DISEASE\n\n157\n\ncancer and a large number of them die from it annually. The mechanisms\n\nthat underlie development of cancer or oncogenic transformation of cells,\n\nits treatment and control have been some of the most intense areas of\n\nresearch in biology and medicine.\n\nIn our body, cell growth and differentiation is highly controlled and\n\nregulated. In cancer cells, there is breakdown of these regulatory\n\nmechanisms. Normal cells show a property called contact inhibition by\n\nvirtue of which contact with other cells inhibits their uncontrolled growth.\n\nCancer cells appears to have lost this property. As a result of this, cancerous\n\ncells just continue to divide giving rise to masses of cells called tumors.\n\nTumors are of two types: benign and malignant. Benign tumors normally\n\nremain confined to their original location and do not spread to other parts\n\nof the body and cause little damage. The malignant tumors, on the\n\nother hand are a mass of proliferating cells called neoplastic or tumor\n\ncells. These cells grow very rapidly, invading and damaging the\n\nsurrounding normal tissues. As these cells actively divide and grow they\n\nalso starve the normal cells by competing for vital nutrients. Cells sloughed\n\nfrom such tumors reach distant sites through blood, and wherever they\n\nget lodged in the body, they start a new tumor there. This property called\n\nmetastasis is the most feared property of malignant tumors.\n\nCauses of cancer : Transformation of normal cells into cancerous\n\nneoplastic cells may be induced by physical, chemical or biological agents.\n\nThese agents are called carcinogens. Ionising radiations like X-rays and\n\ngamma rays and non-ionizing radiations like UV cause DNA damage\n\nleading to neoplastic transformation. The chemical carcinogens present\n\nin tobacco smoke have been identified as a major cause of lung cancer.\n\nCancer causing viruses called oncogenic viruses have genes called viral\n\noncogenes. Furthermore, several genes called cellular oncogenes\n\n(c-onc) or proto oncogenes have been identified in normal cells which,\n\nwhen activated under certain conditions, could lead to oncogenic\n\ntransformation of the cells.\n\nCancer detection and diagnosis : Early detection of cancers is essential\n\nas it allows the disease to be treated successfully in many cases. Cancer\n\ndetection is based on biopsy and histopathological studies of the tissue\n\nand blood and bone marrow tests for increased cell counts in the case of\n\nleukemias. In biopsy, a piece of the suspected tissue cut into thin sections\n\nis stained and examined under microscope (histopathological studies) by\n\na pathologist. Techniques like radiography (use of X-rays), CT (computed\n\ntomography) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) are very useful to\n\ndetect cancers of the internal organs. Computed tomography uses X-rays\n\nto generate a three-dimensional image of the internals of an object. MRI\n\nuses strong magnetic fields and non-ionising radiations to accurately detect\n\npathological and physiological changes in the living tissue.\n\nAntibodies against cancer-specific antigens are also used for\n\ndetection of certain cancers. Techniques of molecular biology can be\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n158\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nFigure 8.7 Chemical structure of Morphine Figure 8.8 Opium poppy\n\napplied to detect genes in individuals with inherited susceptibility to\n\ncertain cancers. Identification of such genes, which predispose an\n\nindividual to certain cancers, may be very helpful in prevention of\n\ncancers. Such individuals may be advised to avoid exposure to\n\nparticular carcinogens to which they are susceptible (e.g., tobacco\n\nsmoke in case of lung cancer).\n\nTreatment of cancer : The common approaches for treatment of cancer\n\nare surgery, radiation therapy and immunotherapy. In radiotherapy,\n\ntumor cells are irradiated lethally, taking proper care of the normal tissues\n\nsurrounding the tumor mass. Several chemotherapeutic drugs are used\n\nto kill cancerous cells. Some of these are specific for particular tumors.\n\nMajority of drugs have side effects like hair loss, anemia, etc. Most cancers\n\nare treated by combination of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy.\n\nTumor cells have been shown to avoid detection and destruction by\n\nimmune system. Therefore, the patients are given substances called\n\nbiological response modifiers such as ααααα-interferon which activates their\n\nimmune system and helps in destroying the tumor.\n\n8.5 DRUGS AND ALCOHOL ABUSE\n\nSurveys and statistics show that use of drugs and alcohol has been on\n\nthe rise especially among the youth. This is really a cause of concern as it\n\ncould result in many harmful effects. Proper education and guidance\n\nwould enable youth to safeguard themselves against these dangerous\n\nbehaviour patterns and follow healthy lifestyles.\n\nThe drugs, which are commonly abused are opioids, cannabinoids\n\nand coca alkaloids. Majority of these are obtained from flowering plants.\n\nSome are obtained from fungi.\n\nOpioids are the drugs, which bind to specific opioid receptors present\n\nin our central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. Heroin\n\n(Figure 8.7), commonly called smack is chemically diacetylmorphine which\n\nis a white, odourless, bitter crystalline compound. This is obtained by\n\nacetylation of morphine (Figure 8.7), which is extracted from the latex of\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nHUMAN HEALTH AND DISEASE\n\n159\n\npoppy plant Papaver somniferum (Figure 8.8). Generally taken by snorting\n\nand injection, heroin is a depressant and slows down body functions.\n\nCannabinoids are a group of chemicals (Figure 8.9), which interact\n\nwith cannabinoid receptors present principally in the brain. Natural\n\ncannabinoids are obtained from the inflorescences of the plant Cannabis\n\nsativa (Figure 8.10). The flower tops, leaves and the resin of cannabis\n\nplant are used in various combinations to produce marijuana,  hashish,\n\ncharas and ganja. Generally taken by inhalation and oral ingestion, these\n\nare known for their effects on cardiovascular system of the body.\n\nFigure 8.9 Skeletal structure of\ncannabinoid molecule\n\nFigure 8.10 Leaves of Cannabis sativa\n\nCoca alkaloid or cocaine is obtained from coca\n\nplant Erythroxylum coca, native to South America. It\n\ninterferes with the transport of the neuro-transmitter\n\ndopamine. Cocaine, commonly called coke or crack is\n\nusually snorted. It has a potent stimulating action on\n\ncentral nervous system, producing a sense of euphoria\n\nand increased energy. Excessive dosage of cocaine\n\ncauses hallucinations. Other well-known plants with\n\nhallucinogenic properties are Atropa belladona and\n\nDatura (Figure 8.11). These days cannabinoids are also\n\nbeing abused by some sportspersons.\n\n Drugs like barbiturates, amphetamines,\n\nbenzodiazepines, and other similar drugs, that are\n\nnormally used as medicines to help patients cope with\n\nmental illnesses like depression and insomnia, are often\n\nabused. Morphine is a very effective sedative and painkiller, and is very useful\n\nin patients who have undergone surgery. Several plants,  fruits and seeds\n\nhaving hallucinogenic properties have been used for hundreds of years in\n\nfolk-medicine, religious ceremonies and rituals all over the globe. When these\n\nare taken for a purpose other than medicinal use or in amounts/frequency\n\nthat impairs one’s physical, physiological or psychological functions, it\n\nconstitutes drug abuse.\n\nFigure 8.11 Flowering branch of Datura\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n160\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nSmoking also paves the way to hard drugs.  Tobacco has been used\n\nby human beings for more than 400 years. It is smoked, chewed or used\n\nas a snuff. Tobacco contains a large number of chemical substances\n\nincluding nicotine, an alkaloid. Nicotine stimulates adrenal gland to\n\nrelease adrenaline and nor-adrenaline into blood circulation, both of\n\nwhich raise blood pressure and increase heart rate. Smoking is associated\n\nwith increased incidence of cancers of lung, urinary bladder and throat,\n\nbronchitis, emphysema, coronary heart disease, gastric ulcer, etc. Tobacco\n\nchewing is associated with increased risk of cancer of the oral cavity.\n\nSmoking increases carbon monoxide (CO) content in blood and reduces\n\nthe concentration of haembound oxygen.  This causes oxygen deficiency\n\nin the body.\n\nWhen one buys packets of cigarettes one cannot miss the statutory\n\nwarning that is present on the packing which warns against smoking\n\nand says how it is injurious to health. Yet, smoking is very prevalent in\n\nsociety, both among young and old. Knowing the dangers of smoking\n\nand chewing tobacco, and its addictive nature, the youth and old need to\n\navoid these habits. Any addict requires counselling and medical help to\n\nget rid of the habit.\n\n8.5.1 Adolescence and Drug/Alcohol Abuse\n\nAdolescence means both ‘a period’ and ‘a process’ during which a child\n\nbecomes mature in terms of his/her attitudes and beliefs for effective\n\nparticipation in society. The period between 12-18 years of age may\n\nbe thought of as adolescence period. In other words, adolescence is a\n\nbridge linking childhood and adulthood. Adolescence is accompanied\n\nby several biological and behavioural changes. Adolescence, thus is a\n\nvery vulnerable phase of mental and psychological development of an\n\nindividual.\n\nCuriosity, need for adventure and excitement, and experimentation,\n\nconstitute common causes, which motivate youngsters towards drug\n\nand alcohol use. A child’s natural curiosity motivates him/her to\n\nexperiment. This is complicated further by effects that might be perceived\n\nas benefits, of alcohol or drug use. Thus, the first use of drugs or alcohol\n\nmay be out of curiosity or experimentation, but later the child starts\n\nusing these to escape facing problems. Of late, stress, from pressures to\n\nexcel in academics or examinations, has played a significant role in\n\npersuading the youngsters to try alcohol and drugs. The perception\n\namong youth that it is ‘cool’ or progressive to smoke, use drugs or\n\nalcohol, is also in a way a major cause for youth to start these habits.\n\nTelevision, movies, newspapers, internet also help to promote this\n\nperception. Other factors that have been seen to be associated with drug\n\nand alcohol abuse among adolescents are unstable or unsupportive\n\nfamily structures and peer pressure.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nHUMAN HEALTH AND DISEASE\n\n161\n\n8.5.2 Addiction and Dependence\n\nBecause of the perceived benefits, drugs are frequently used repeatedly.\n\nThe most important thing, which one fails to realise, is the inherent\n\naddictive nature of alcohol and drugs. Addiction is a psychological\n\nattachment to certain effects –such as euphoria and a temporary feeling\n\nof well-being – associated with drugs and alcohol. These drive people to\n\ntake them even when these are not needed, or even when their use becomes\n\nself-destructive. With repeated use of drugs, the tolerance level of the\n\nreceptors present in our body increases. Consequently the receptors\n\nrespond only to higher doses of drugs or alcohol leading to greater intake\n\nand addiction. However, it should be clearly borne in mind that use of\n\nthese drugs even once, can be a fore-runner to addiction. Thus, the\n\naddictive potential of drugs and alcohol, pull the user into a vicious circle\n\nleading to their regular use (abuse) from which he/she may not be able\n\nto get out. In the absence of any guidance or counselling, the person gets\n\naddicted and becomes dependent on their use.\n\nDependence is the tendency of the body to manifest a characteristic\n\nand unpleasant withdrawal syndrome if regular dose of drugs/alcohol\n\nis abruptly discontinued. This is characterised by anxiety, shakiness,\n\nnausea and sweating, which may be relieved when use is resumed again.\n\nIn some cases, withdrawal symptoms can be severe and even life\n\nthreatening and the person may need medical supervision.\n\nDependence leads the patient to ignore all social norms in order to\n\nget sufficient funds to satiate his/her needs. These result in many social\n\nadjustment problems.\n\n8.5.3 Effects of Drug/Alcohol Abuse\n\nThe immediate adverse effects of drugs and alcohol abuse are manifested\n\nin the form of reckless behaviour, vandalism and violence. Excessive\n\ndoses of drugs may lead to coma and death due to respiratory failure,\n\nheart failure or cerebral hemorrhage. A combination of drugs or their\n\nintake along with alcohol generally results in overdosing and even\n\ndeaths. The most common warning signs of drug and alcohol abuse\n\namong youth include drop in academic performance, unexplained\n\nabsence from school/college, lack of interest in personal hygiene,\n\nwithdrawal, isolation, depression, fatigue, aggressive and rebellious\n\nbehaviour, deteriorating relationships with family and friends, loss of\n\ninterest in hobbies, change in sleeping and eating habits, fluctuations\n\nin weight, appetite, etc.\n\nThere may even be some far-reaching implications of drug/alcohol\n\nabuse. If an abuser is unable to get money to buy drugs/alcohol he/she\n\nmay turn to stealing. The adverse effects are just not restricted to the\n\nperson who is using drugs or alcohol. At times, a drug/alcohol addict\n\nbecomes the cause of mental and financial distress to his/her entire family\n\nand friends.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n162\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nThose who take drugs intravenously (direct injection into the vein\n\nusing a needle and syringe), are much more likely to acquire serious\n\ninfections like AIDS and Hepatitis B. The viruses, which are responsible\n\nfor these diseases, are transferred from one person to another by sharing\n\nof infected needles and syringes. Both AIDS and Hepatitis B infections\n\nare chronic infections and ultimately fatal. Both can be transmitted\n\nthrough sexual contact or infected blood.\n\nThe use of alcohol during adolescence may also have long-term effects.\n\nIt could lead to heavy drinking in adulthood. The chronic use of drugs and\n\nalcohol damages nervous system and liver (cirrhosis). The use of drugs\n\nand alcohol during pregnancy is also known to adversely affect the foetus.\n\nAnother misuse of drugs is what certain sportspersons do to enhance\n\ntheir performance.  They (mis)use narcotic analgesics, anabolic steroids,\n\ndiuretics and certain hormones in sports to increase muscle strength and\n\nbulk and to promote aggressiveness and as a result increase athletic\n\nperformance. The side-effects of the use of anabolic steroids in females\n\ninclude masculinisation (features like males), increased aggressiveness,\n\nmood swings, depression, abnormal menstrual cycles, excessive hair\n\ngrowth on the face and body, enlargement of clitoris, deepening of voice.\n\nIn males it includes acne, increased aggressiveness, mood swings,\n\ndepression, reduction of size of the testicles, decreased sperm production,\n\npotential for kidney and liver dysfunction, breast enlargement, premature\n\nbaldness, enlargement of the prostate gland.  These effects may be\n\npermanent with prolonged use.  In the adolescent male or female, severe\n\nfacial and body acne, and premature closure of the growth centres of the\n\nlong bones may result in stunted growth.\n\n8.5.4 Prevention and Control\n\nThe age-old adage of ‘prevention is better than cure’ holds true here also.\n\nIt is also true that habits such as smoking, taking drug or alcohol are\n\nmore likely to be taken up at a young age, more during adolescence.\n\nHence, it is best to identify the situations that may push an adolescent\n\ntowards use of drugs or alcohol, and to take remedial measures well in\n\ntime. In this regard, the parents and the teachers have a special\n\nresponsibility. Parenting that combines with high levels of nurturance\n\nand consistent discipline, has been associated with lowered risk of\n\nsubstance (alcohol/drugs/tobacco) abuse. Some of the measures\n\nmentioned here would be particularly useful for prevention and control\n\nof alcohol and drugs abuse among adolescents\n\n(i) Avoid undue peer pressure - Every child has his/her own choice\n\nand personality, which should be respected and nurtured. A child\n\nshould not be pushed unduly to perform beyond his/her threshold\n\nlimits; be it studies, sports or other activities.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nHUMAN HEALTH AND DISEASE\n\n163\n\nSUMMARY\n\nHealth is not just the absence of disease. It is a state of complete physical,\n\nmental, social and psychological well-being. Diseases like typhoid,\n\ncholera, pneumonia, fungal infections of skin, malaria and many others\n\nare a major cause of distress to human beings. Vector-borne diseases\n\nlike malaria especially one caused by Plasmodium falciparum, if not\n\ntreated, may prove fatal. Besides personal cleanliness and hygiene,\n\npublic health measures like proper disposal of waste, decontamination\n\nof drinking water, control of vectors like mosquitoes and immunisation\n\nare very helpful in preventing these diseases. Our immune system plays\n\nthe major role in preventing these diseases when we are exposed to\n\ndisease-causing agents. The innate defences of our body like skin,\n\nmucous membranes, antimicrobial substances present in our tears,\n\nsaliva and the phagocytic cells help to block the entry of pathogens\n\ninto our body. If the pathogens succeed in gaining entry to our body,\n\nspecific antibodies (humoral immune response) and cells (cell mediated\n\nimmune response) serve to kill these pathogens. Immune system has\n\nmemory. On subsequent exposure to same pathogen, the immune\n\nresponse is rapid and more intense. This forms the basis of protection\n\n(ii) Education and counselling - Educating and counselling him/\n\nher to face problems and stresses, and to accept disappointments\n\nand failures as a part of life. It would also be worthwhile to channelise\n\nthe child’s energy into healthy pursuits like sports, reading, music,\n\nyoga and other extracurricular activities.\n\n(iii) Seeking help from parents and peers - Help from parents and\n\npeers should be sought immediately so that they can guide\n\nappropriately. Help may even be sought from close and trusted\n\nfriends. Besides getting proper advise to sort out their problems,\n\nthis would help young to vent their feelings of anxiety and guilt.\n\n(iv) Looking for danger signs - Alert parents and teachers need to\n\nlook for and identify the danger signs discussed above. Even friends,\n\nif they find someone using drugs or alcohol, should not hesitate to\n\nbring this to the notice of parents or teacher in the best interests of\n\nthe person concerned. Appropriate measures would then be required\n\nto diagnose the malady and the underlying causes. This would help\n\nin initiating proper remedial steps or treatment.\n\n(v) Seeking professional and medical help - A lot of help is available\n\nin the form of highly qualified psychologists, psychiatrists, and de-\n\naddiction and rehabilitation programmes to help individuals who\n\nhave unfortunately got in the quagmire of drug/alcohol abuse. With\n\nsuch help, the affected individual with sufficient efforts and will power,\n\ncan get rid of the problem completely and lead a perfectly normal\n\nand healthy life.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n164\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nafforded by vaccination and immunisation. Among other diseases, AIDS\n\nand cancer kill a large number of individuals worldwide. AIDS caused\n\nby the human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) is fatal but can be\n\nprevented if certain precautions are taken. Many cancers are curable if\n\ndetected early and appropriate therapeutic measures are taken. Of late,\n\ndrug and alcohol abuse among youth and adolescents is becoming\n\nanother cause of concern. Because of the addictive nature of alcohol\n\nand drugs, and their perceived benefits like relief from stress, a person\n\nmay try taking these in the face of peer pressure, examinations-related\n\nand competition-related stresses. In doing so, he/she may get addicted\n\nto them. Education about their harmful effects, counselling and seeking\n\nimmediate professional and medical help would totally relieve the\n\nindividual from these evils.\n\nEXERCISES\n1.

Several new techniques like embryo\n\ntransfer technology and tissue culture techniques are going\n\nto play a pivotal role in further enhancing food production.\n\n9.1 ANIMAL HUSBANDRY\n\nAnimal husbandry is the agricultural practice of breeding\n\nand raising livestock. As such it is a vital skill for farmers\n\nand is as much science as it is art.  Animal husbandry\n\ndeals with the care and breeding of livestock like buffaloes,\n\ncows, pigs, horses, cattle, sheep, camels, goats, etc., that\n\nare useful to humans. Extended, it includes poultry\n\nfarming and fisheries. Fisheries include rearing, catching,\n\nselling, etc., of fish, molluscs (shell-fish) and crustaceans\n\n(prawns, crabs, etc.). Since time immemorial, animals like\n\nbees, silk-worm, prawns, crabs, fishes, birds, pigs, cattle,\n\nsheep and camels have been used by humans for products\n\nlike milk, eggs, meat, wool, silk, honey, etc.\n\nIt is estimated that more then 70 per cent of the world\n\nlivestock population is in India and China.  However, it is\n\nCHAPTER 9\n\nSTRATEGIES FOR ENHANCEMENT\n\nIN FOOD PRODUCTION\n\n9.1 Animal Husbandry\n\n9.2 Plant Breeding\n\n9.3 Single Cell Proteins\n\n9.4 Tissue Culture\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n166\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nsurprising to note that the contribution to the world farm produce is only\n\n25 per cent, i.e., the productivity per unit is very low. Hence, in addition\n\nto conventional practices of animal breeding and care, newer technologies\n\nalso have to be applied to achieve improvement in quality and productivity.\n\n9.1.1 Management of Farms and Farm Animals\n\nA professional approach to what have been traditional practices of farm\n\nmanagement gives the much needed boost to our food production. Let us\n\ndiscuss some of the management procedures, employed in various animal\n\nfarm systems.\n\n9.1.1.1 Dairy Farm Management\n\nDairying is the management of animals for milk and its products for\n\nhuman consumption.  Can you list the animals that you would expect\n\nto find in a dairy? What are different kinds of products that can be\n\nmade with milk from a dairy farm?  In dairy farm management, we deal\n\nwith processes and systems that increase yield and improve quality of\n\nmilk.  Milk yield is primarily dependent on the quality of breeds in the\n\nfarm. Selection of good breeds having high yielding potential (under the\n\nclimatic conditions of the area), combined with resistance to diseases is\n\nvery important. For the yield potential to be realised the cattle have to be\n\nwell looked after – they have to be housed well, should have adequate\n\nwater and be maintained disease free. The feeding of cattle should be\n\ncarried out in a scientific manner – with special emphasis on the quality\n\nand quantity of fodder.  Besides, stringent cleanliness and hygiene (both\n\nof the cattle and the handlers) are of paramount importance while milking,\n\nstorage and transport of the milk and its products. Nowadays, of course,\n\nmuch of these processes have become mechanised, which reduces chance\n\nof direct contact of the produce with the handler. Ensuring these stringent\n\nmeasures would of course, require regular inspections, with proper record\n\nkeeping. It would also help to identify and rectify the problems as early\n\nas possible. Regular visits by a veterinary doctor would be  mandatory.\n\nYou would probably find it interesting if you were to prepare a\n\nquestionnaire on diverse aspects of dairy keeping and then follow it up with\n\na visit to a dairy farm in your locality and seek answers to the questions.\n\n9.1.1.2 Poultry Farm Management\n\nPoultry is the class of domesticated fowl (birds) used for food or for their\n\neggs.  They typically include chicken and ducks, and sometimes turkey and\n\ngeese.  The word poultry is often used to refer to the meat of only these birds,\n\nbut in a more general sense it may refer to the meat of other birds too.\n\nAs in dairy farming, selection of disease free and suitable breeds,\n\nproper and safe farm conditions, proper feed and water, and hygiene and\n\nhealth care are important components of poultry farm management.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nSTRATEGIES FOR ENHANCEMENT IN FOOD PRODUCTION\n\n167\n\nYou may have seen TV news or read newspaper–\n\nreports about the ‘bird flu virus’ which created a scare in\n\nthe country and drastically affected egg and chicken\n\nconsumption.  Find out more about it and discuss whether\n\nthe panic reaction was justified. How can we prevent the\n\nspread of the flu in case some chicken are infected?\n\n9.1.2 Animal Breeding\n\nBreeding of animals is an important aspect of animal\n\nhusbandry.  Animal breeding aims at increasing the yield\n\nof animals and improving the desirable qualities of the\n\nproduce. For what kind of characters would we breed\n\nanimals? Would the selection of characters differ with\n\nthe choice of animals?\n\nWhat do we understand by the term ‘breed’?  A group\n\nof animals related by descent and similar in most characters\n\nlike general appearance, features, size, configuration, etc.,\n\nare said to belong to a breed. Find out the names of some\n\ncommon breeds of cattle and poultry in the farms of your\n\narea.\n\nWhen breeding is between animals of the same breed it\n\nis called inbreeding, while crosses between different breeds\n\nare called outbreeding.\n\nInbreeding : Inbreeding refers to the mating of more\n\nclosely related individuals within the same breed for 4-\n\n6 generations. The breeding strategy is as follows – superior males and\n\nsuperior females of the same breed are identified and mated in pairs.\n\nThe progeny obtained from such matings are evaluated and superior\n\nmales and females among them are identified for further mating. A\n\nsuperior female, in the case of cattle, is the cow or buffalo that produces\n\nmore milk per lactation. On the other hand, a superior male is the bull,\n\nwhich gives rise to superior progeny as compared to those of other\n\nmales.\n\nTry to recollect the homozygous purelines developed by Mendel as\n\ndiscussed in Chapter 5. A similar strategy is used for developing purelines\n\nin cattle as was used in case of peas. Inbreeding increases homozygosity.\n\nThus inbreeding is necessary if we want to evolve a pureline in any animal.\n\nInbreeding exposes harmful recessive genes that are eliminated by selection.\n\nIt also helps in accumulation of superior genes and elimination of less\n\ndesirable genes. Therefore, this approach, where there is selection at each\n\nstep, increases the productivity of inbred population. However, continued\n\ninbreeding, especially close inbreeding, usually reduces fertility and even\n\nproductivity. This is called inbreeding depression.  Whenever this becomes\n\na problem, selected animals of the breeding population should be mated\n\nFigure 9.1 Improved breed of\ncattle and chickens\n(a) Jersey (b) Leghorn\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n168\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nwith unrelated superior animals of the same breed. This usually helps\n\nrestore fertility and yield.\n\nOut-breeding : Out-breeding is the breeding of the unrelated animals,\n\nwhich may be between individuals of the same breed but having no\n\ncommon ancestors for 4-6 generations (out-crossing) or between\n\ndifferent breeds (cross-breeding) or different species (inter-specific\n\nhybridisation).\n\nOut-crossing: This is the practice of mating of animals within the same\n\nbreed, but having no common ancestors on either side of their pedigree\n\nup to 4-6 generations. The offspring of such a mating is known as an\n\nout-cross. It is the best breeding method for animals that are below\n\naverage in productivity in milk production, growth rate in beef cattle,\n\netc. A single outcross often helps to overcome inbreeding depression.\n\nCross-breeding: In this method, superior males of one breed are mated\n\nwith superior females of another breed. Cross-breeding allows the\n\ndesirable qualities of two different breeds to be combined. The progeny\n\nhybrid animals may themselves be used for commercial production.\n\nAlternatively, they may be subjected to some form of inbreeding and\n\nselection to develop new stable breeds that may be superior to the existing\n\nbreeds. Many new animal breeds have been developed by this approach.\n\nHisardale is a new breed of sheep developed in Punjab by crossing\n\nBikaneri ewes and Marino rams.\n\nInterspecific hybridisation: In this method, male and female animals\n\nof two different related species are mated. In some cases, the progeny\n\nmay combine desirable features of both the parents, and may be of\n\nconsiderable economic value, e.g., the mule (Figure 9.2). Do you know\n\nwhat cross leads to the production of the mule?\n\nControlled breeding experiments are carried out using artificial\n\ninsemination.  The semen is collected from the male that\n\nis chosen as a parent and injected into the reproductive\n\ntract of the selected female by the breeder.  The semen\n\nmay be used immediately or can be frozen and used at a\n\nlater date. It can also be transported in a frozen form to\n\nwhere the female is housed. In this way desirable matings\n\nare carried. Artificial insemination helps us overcome\n\nseveral problems of normal matings.  Can you discuss\n\nand list some of them?\n\nOften, the success rate of crossing mature male and\n\nfemale animals is fairly low even though artificial\n\ninsemination is carried out.  To improve chances of\n\nsuccessful production of hybrids, other means are also used. Multiple\n\nOvulation Embryo Transfer Technology (MOET) is one such\n\nprogramme for herd improvement.  In this method, a cow is administered\n\nhormones, with FSH-like activity, to induce follicular maturation and super\n\novulation – instead of one egg, which they normally yield per cycle, they\n\nFigure 9.2 Mule\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nSTRATEGIES FOR ENHANCEMENT IN FOOD PRODUCTION\n\n169\n\nproduce 6-8 eggs. The animal is either mated with an elite bull or\n\nartificially inseminated. The fertilised eggs at 8–32 cells stages, are\n\nrecovered non-surgically and transferred to surrogate mothers. The genetic\n\nmother is available for another round of super ovulation. This technology\n\nhas been demonstrated for cattle, sheep, rabbits, buffaloes, mares, etc.\n\nHigh milk-yielding breeds of females and high quality (lean meat with\n\nless lipid) meat-yielding bulls have been bred successfully to increase\n\nherd size in a short time.\n\n9.1.3 Bee-keeping\n\nBee-keeping or apiculture is the maintenance of hives of honeybees for\n\nthe production of honey. It has been an age-old cottage industry. Honey\n\nis a food of high nutritive value and also finds use in the indigenous\n\nsystems of medicine.  Honeybee also produces beeswax, which finds many\n\nuses in industry, such as in the preparation of cosmetics and polishes of\n\nvarious kinds. The increased demand of honey has led to large-scale bee-\n\nkeeping practices; it has become an established income generating\n\nindustry, whether practiced on a small or on a large scale.\n\nBee-keeping can be practiced in any area where there are sufficient\n\nbee pastures of some wild shrubs, fruit orchards and cultivated crops.\n\nThere are several species of honeybees which can be reared. Of these, the\n\nmost common species is Apis indica. Beehives can be kept in one’s\n\ncourtyard, on the verandah of the house or even on the roof. Bee-keeping\n\nis not labour-intensive.\n\nBee-keeping though relatively easy does require some specialised\n\nknowledge and there are several organisations that teach bee-keeping.\n\nThe following points are important for successful bee-keeping:\n\n(i) Knowledge of the nature and habits of bees,\n\n(ii) Selection of suitable location for keeping the beehives,\n\n(iii) Catching and hiving of swarms (group of bees),\n\n(iv) Management of beehives during different seasons, and\n\n(v) Handling and collection of honey and of beeswax. Bees are the pollinators\n\nof many of our crop species (see chapter 2) such as sunflower, Brassica,\n\napple and pear. Keeping beehives in crop fields during flowering period\n\nincreases pollination efficiency and improves the yield–beneficial both\n\nfrom the point of view of crop yield and honey yield.\n\n9.1.4 Fisheries\n\nFishery is an industry devoted to the catching, processing or selling of fish,\n\nshellfish or other aquatic animals. A large number of our population is\n\ndependent on fish, fish products and other aquatic animals such as prawn,\n\ncrab, lobster, edible oyster, etc., for food. Some of the freshwater fishes which\n\nare very common include Catla, Rohu and common carp. Some of the marine\n\nfishes that are eaten include – Hilsa, Sardines, Mackerel and Pomfrets.\n\nFind out what fishes are commonly eaten in your area.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n170\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nFisheries has an important place in Indian economy. It provides income\n\nand employment to millions of fishermen and farmers, particularly in the\n\ncoastal states.  For many, it is the only source of their livelihood. In order\n\nto meet the increasing demands on fisheries, different techniques have\n\nbeen employed to increase production. For example, through aquaculture\n\nand pisciculture we have been able to increase the production of aquatic\n\nplants and animals, both fresh-water and marine. Find out the difference\n\nbetween pisciculture and aquaculture. This has led to the development\n\nand flourishing of the fishery industry, and it has brought a lot of income\n\nto the farmers in particular and the country in general. We now talk about\n\n‘Blue Revolution’ as being implemented along the same lines as ‘Green\n\nRevolution’.\n\n9.2 PLANT BREEDING\n\nTraditional farming can only yield a limited biomass, as food for humans\n\nand animals. Better management practices and increase in acreage can\n\nincrease yield, but only to a limited extent. Plant breeding as a technology\n\nhas helped increase yields to a very large extent. Who in India has not\n\nheard of Green Revolution which was responsible for our country to\n\nnot merely meet the national requirements in food production but also\n\nhelped us even to export it?  Green revolution was dependent to a large\n\nextent on plant breeding techniques for development of high-yielding and\n\ndisease resistant varieties in wheat, rice, maize, etc.\n\n9.2.1 What is Plant Breeding?\n\nPlant breeding is the purposeful manipulation of plant species in order to\n\ncreate desired plant types that are better suited for cultivation, give better\n\nyields and are disease resistant. Conventional plant breeding has been\n\npracticed for thousands of years, since the beginning of human civilisation;\n\nrecorded evidence of plant breeding dates back to 9,000-11,000 years ago.\n\nMany present-day crops are the result of domestication in ancient times.\n\nToday, all our major food crops are derived from domesticated varieties.\n\nClassical plant breeding involves crossing or hybridisation of pure lines,\n\nfollowed by artificial selection to produce plants with desirable traits of higher\n\nyield, nutrition and resistance to diseases. With advancements in genetics,\n\nmolecular biology and tissue culture, plant breeding is now increasingly\n\nbeing carried out by using molecular genetic tools.\n\nIf we were to list the traits or characters that the breeders have tried to\n\nincorporate into crop plants, the first we would list would be increased\n\ncrop yield and improved quality.  Increased tolerance to environmental\n\nstresses (salinity, extreme temperatures, drought), resistance to pathogens\n\n(viruses, fungi and bacteria) and  increased tolerance to insect pests would\n\nbe on our list too.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nSTRATEGIES FOR ENHANCEMENT IN FOOD PRODUCTION\n\n171\n\nPlant breeding programmes are carried out in a systematic way\n\nworldwide–in government institutions and commercial companies.  The\n\nmain steps in breeding a new genetic variety of a crop are –\n\n(i) Collection of variability: Genetic variability is the root of any\n\nbreeding programme. In many crops pre-existing genetic variability\n\nis available from wild relatives of the crop. Collection and preservation\n\nof all the different wild varieties, species and  relatives of the cultivated\n\nspecies (followed by their evaluation for their characteristics) is a\n\npre-requisite for effective exploitation of natural genes available in\n\nthe populations. The entire collection (of plants/seeds) having all\n\nthe diverse alleles for all genes in a given crop is called germplasm\n\ncollection.\n\n(ii) Evaluation and selection of parents: The germplasm is evaluated\n\nso as to identify plants with desirable combination of characters.\n\nThe selected plants are multiplied and used in the process of\n\nhybridisation. Purelines are created wherever desirable and possible.\n\n(iii) Cross hybridisation among the selected parents: The desired\n\ncharacters have very often to be combined from two different plants\n\n(parents), for example high protein quality of one parent may need\n\nto be combined with disease resistance from another parent. This is\n\npossible by cross hybridising the two parents to produce hybrids\n\nthat  genetically combine the desired characters in one plant. This is\n\na very time-consuming and tedious process since the pollen\n\ngrains from the desirable plant chosen as male parent have to be\n\ncollected and placed on the stigma of the flowers selected as female\n\nparent (In chapter 2 details on how to make crosses have been\n\ndescribed).  Also, it is not necessary that the hybrids do combine the\n\ndesirable characters; usually only one in few hundred to a thousand\n\ncrosses shows the desirable combination.\n\n(iv) Selection and testing of superior recombinants: This step\n\nconsists of selecting, among the progeny of the hybrids, those plants\n\nthat have the desired character combination. The selection process is\n\ncrucial to the success of the breeding objective and requires careful\n\nscientific evaluation of the progeny. This step yields plants that are\n\nsuperior to both of the parents (very often more than one superior\n\nprogeny plant may become available). These are self-pollinated for\n\nseveral generations till they reach a state of uniformity (homozygosity),\n\nso that the characters will not segregate in the progeny.\n\n(v) Testing, release and commercialisation of new cultivars: The\n\nnewly selected lines are evaluated for their yield and other agronomic\n\ntraits of quality, disease resistance, etc. This evaluation is done by\n\ngrowing these in the research fields and recording their performance\n\nunder ideal fertiliser application, irrigation, and other crop\n\nmanagement practices. The evaluation in research fields is followed\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n172\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nby testing the materials in farmers’ fields, for at least three growing\n\nseasons at several locations in the country, representing all the\n\nagroclimatic zones where the crop is usually grown. The material is\n\nevaluated in comparison to the best available local crop cultivar – a\n\ncheck or reference cultivar.\n\nIndia is mainly an agricultural country. Agriculture accounts\n\nfor approximately 33 per cent of India’s GDP and employs nearly\n\n62 per cent of the population. After India’s independence, one of the main\n\nchallenges facing the country was that of producing enough food for the\n\nincreasing population. As only limited land is fit for cultivation, India has\n\nto strive to increase yields per unit area from existing farm land. The\n\ndevelopment of several high yielding varieties of wheat and rice in the\n\nmid-1960s, as a result of various plant breeding techniques led to dramatic\n\nincrease in food production in our country.  This phase is often referred\n\nto as the Green Revolution. Figure 9.3 represents some Indian hybrid\n\ncrops of high yeilding varieties.\n\n(c)\n\n(b)(a)\n\nFigure 9.3 Some Indian hybrid crops: (a) Maize; (b) Wheat; (c) Garden peas\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nSTRATEGIES FOR ENHANCEMENT IN FOOD PRODUCTION\n\n173\n\nWheat and Rice: During the period 1960 to 2000, wheat production\n\nincreased from 11 million tonnes to 75 million tonnes while rice production\n\nwent up from 35 million tonnes to 89.5 million tonnes. This was due to the\n\ndevelopment of semi-dwarf varieties of wheat and rice. Nobel laureate\n\nNorman E. Borlaug, at International Centre for Wheat and Maize\n\nImprovement in Mexico, developed semi-dwarf wheat. In 1963, several\n\nvarieties such as Sonalika and Kalyan Sona, which were high yielding and\n\ndisease resistant, were introduced all over the wheat-growing belt of India.\n\nSemi-dwarf rice varieties were derived from IR-8, (developed at International\n\nRice Research Institute (IRRI), Philippines) and Taichung Native-1 (from\n\nTaiwan). The derivatives were introduced in 1966. Later  better-yielding semi-\n\ndwarf varieties Jaya and Ratna were developed in India.\n\nSugar cane: Saccharum barberi was originally grown in north India, but\n\nhad poor sugar content and yield. Tropical canes grown in south India\n\nSaccharum officinarum had thicker stems and higher sugar content but\n\ndid not grow well in north India. These two species were successfully\n\ncrossed to get sugar cane varieties combining the desirable qualities of\n\nhigh yield, thick stems, high sugar and ability to grow in the sugar cane\n\nareas of north India.\n\nMillets:  Hybrid maize, jowar and bajra have been successfully developed\n\nin India. Hybrid breeding have led to the development of several high\n\nyielding varieties resistant to water stress.\n\n9.2.2 Plant Breeding for Disease Resistance\n\nA wide range of fungal, bacterial and viral pathogens, affect the yield of\n\ncultivated crop species, especially in tropical climates. Crop losses can\n\noften be significant, up to 20-30 per cent, or sometimes even total. In this\n\nsituation, breeding and development of cultivars resistant to disease\n\nenhances food production. This also helps reduce the dependence on\n\nuse of  fungicides and bacteriocides. Resistance of the host plant is the\n\nability to prevent the pathogen from causing disease and is determined\n\nby the genetic constitution of the host plant. Before breeding is\n\nundertaken, it is important to know about the causative organism and\n\nthe mode of transmission. Some of the diseases caused by fungi are rusts,\n\ne.g., brown rust of wheat, red rot of sugarcane and late blight of potato;\n\nby  bacteria – black rot of crucifers; and by viruses – tobacco mosaic,\n\nturnip mosaic, etc.\n\nMethods of breeding for disease resistance: Breeding is carried\n\nout by the conventional breeding techniques (described earlier) or by\n\nmutation breeding. The conventional method of breeding for disease\n\nresistance is that of hybridisation and selection. It’s steps are essentially\n\nidentical to those for breeding for any other agronomic characters such\n\nas high yield. The various sequential steps are : screening germplasm\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n174\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nfor resistance sources, hybridisation of selected parents, selection and\n\nevaluation of the hybrids and testing and release of new varieties.\n\nSome crop varieties bred by hybridisation and selection, for\n\ndisease resistance to fungi, bacteria and viral diseases are released\n\n(Table 9.1).\n\nTable 9.1\n\nCrop Variety Resistance to diseases\n\nWheat Himgiri Leaf and stripe rust, hill bunt\n\nBrassica Pusa swarnim White rust\n\n(Karan rai)\n\nCauliflower Pusa Shubhra, Black rot and Curl\n\nPusa Snowball K-1 blight black rot\n\nCowpea Pusa Komal Bacterial blight\n\nChilli Pusa Sadabahar Chilly mosaic virus,\n\nTobacco mosaic virus\n\nand Leaf curl\n\nConventional breeding is often constrained by the availability of limited\n\nnumber of disease resistance genes that are present and identified in various\n\ncrop varieties or wild relatives.  Inducing mutations in plants through diverse\n\nmeans and then screening the plant materials for resistance sometimes\n\nleads to desirable genes being identified.  Plants having these desirable\n\ncharacters can then be either multiplied directly or can be used in breeding.\n\nOther breeding methods that are used are selection amongst somaclonal\n\nvariants and genetic engineering.\n\nMutation is the process by which genetic variations are created\n\nthrough changes in the base sequence within genes (see Chapter 5)\n\nresulting in the creation of a new character or trait not found in the parental\n\ntype. It is possible to induce mutations artificially through use of chemicals\n\nor radiations (like gamma radiations), and selecting and using the plants\n\nthat have the desirable character as a source in breeding – this process is\n\ncalled mutation breeding. In mung bean, resistance to yellow mosaic\n\nvirus and powdery mildew were induced by mutations.\n\nSeveral wild relatives of different cultivated species of plants have been\n\nshown to have certain resistant characters but have very low yield.  Hence,\n\nthere is a need to introduce the resistant genes into the high-yielding\n\ncultivated varieties. Resistance to yellow mosaic virus in bhindi\n\n(Abelmoschus esculentus) was transferred from a wild species and\n\nresulted in a new variety of A. esculentus called Parbhani kranti.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nSTRATEGIES FOR ENHANCEMENT IN FOOD PRODUCTION\n\n175\n\nAll the above examples involve sources of resistance genes that are in\n\nthe same crop species, which has to be bred for disease resistance, or in a\n\nrelated wild species. Transfer of resistance genes is achieved by sexual\n\nhybridisation between the target and the source plant followed by\n\nselection.\n\n9.2.3 Plant Breeding for Developing Resistance\nto Insect Pests\n\nAnother major cause for large scale destruction of crop plant and crop\n\nproduce is insect and pest infestation. Insect resistance in host crop plants\n\nmay be due to morphological, biochemical or physiological characteristics.\n\nHairy leaves in several plants are associated with resistance to insect pests,\n\ne.g, resistance to jassids in cotton and cereal leaf beetle in wheat. In wheat,\n\nsolid stems lead to non-preference by the stem sawfly and smooth leaved\n\nand nectar-less cotton varieties do not attract bollworms. High aspartic\n\nacid, low nitrogen and sugar content in maize leads to resistance to maize\n\nstem borers.\n\nBreeding methods for insect pest resistance involve the same steps as\n\nthose for any other agronomic trait such as yield or quality and are as\n\ndiscussed earlier. Sources of resistance genes may be  cultivated varieties,\n\ngermplasm collections of the crop or wild relatives.\n\nSome released crop varieties bred by hybridisation and selection, for\n\ninsect pest resistance are given in Table 9.2.\n\nTable 9.2\n\nCrop Variety Insect Pests\n\nBrassica Pusa Gaurav Aphids\n\n(rapeseed mustard)\n\nFlat bean Pusa Sem 2, Jassids, aphids and\n\nPusa Sem 3 fruit borer\n\nOkra (Bhindi) Pusa Sawani Shoot and Fruit borer\n\nPusa A-4\n\n9.2.4 Plant Breeding for Improved Food Quality\n\nMore than 840 million people in the world do not have adequate food to\n\nmeet their daily food and nutritional requirements. A far greater number–\n\nthree billion people – suffer from micronutrient, protein and vitamin\n\ndeficiencies or ‘hidden hunger’ because they cannot afford to buy enough\n\nfruits, vegetables, legumes, fish and meat. Diets lacking essential\n\nmicronutrients – particularly  iron, vitamin A, iodine and zinc – increase\n\nthe risk for disease, reduce lifespan and reduce mental abilities.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n176\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nBiofortification – breeding crops with higher levels of vitamins and\n\nminerals, or higher protein and healthier fats – is the most practical\n\nmeans to improve public health.\n\nBreeding for improved nutritional quality is undertaken with the\n\nobjectives of improving –\n\n(i) Protein content and quality;\n\n(ii) Oil content and quality;\n\n(iii) Vitamin content; and\n\n(iv) Micronutrient and mineral content.\n\nIn 2000, maize hybrids that had twice the amount of the amino acids,\n\nlysine and tryptophan, compared to existing maize hybrids were\n\ndeveloped. Wheat variety, Atlas 66, having a high protein content, has\n\nbeen used as a donor for improving cultivated wheat.  It has been possible\n\nto develop an iron-fortified rice variety containing over five times as much\n\niron as in commonly consumed varieties.\n\nThe Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi has also released\n\nseveral vegetable crops that are rich in vitamins and minerals, e.g., vitamin\n\nA enriched carrots, spinach, pumpkin; vitamin C enriched bitter gourd,\n\nbathua, mustard, tomato; iron and calcium enriched spinach and bathua;\n\nand protein enriched beans – broad, lablab, French and garden peas.\n\n9.3 SINGLE CELL PROTEIN (SCP)\n\nConventional agricultural production of cereals, pulses, vegetables, fruits,\n\netc., may not be able to meet the demand of food at the rate at which\n\nhuman and animal population is increasing. The shift from grain to meat\n\ndiets also creates more demand for cereals as it takes 3-10 Kg of grain to\n\nproduce 1 Kg of meat by animal farming. Can you explain this statement\n\nin the light of your knowledge of food chains?  More than 25 per cent of\n\nhuman population is suffering from hunger and malnutrition. One of the\n\nalternate sources of proteins for animal and human nutrition is Single\n\nCell Protein (SCP).\n\nMicrobes are being grown on an industrial scale as source of good\n\nprotein. Blue-green algae like Spirulina can be grown easily on materials\n\nlike waste water from potato processing plants (containing starch), straw,\n\nmolasses, animal manure and even sewage, to produce large quantities\n\nand can serve as food rich in protein, minerals, fats, carbohydrate and\n\nvitamins. Incidentally such utilisation also reduces environmental\n\npollution.\n\nCertain bacterial species like Methylophilus methylotrophus, because\n\nof its high rate of biomass production and growth, can be expected to\n\nproduce 25 tonnes of protein. The fact that edible mushrooms are eaten\n\nby many people and large scale mushroom culture is a growing industry\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nSTRATEGIES FOR ENHANCEMENT IN FOOD PRODUCTION\n\n177\n\nmakes it believable that microscopic fungi  too would become\n\nacceptable as food.\n\n9.4 TISSUE CULTURE\n\nAs traditional breeding techniques failed to keep pace with demand and\n\nto provide sufficiently fast and efficient systems for crop improvement,\n\nanother technology called tissue culture got developed. What does tissue\n\nculture mean? It was learnt by scientists, during 1950s, that whole\n\nplants could be regenerated from explants, i.e., any part of a plant taken\n\nout and grown in a test tube, under sterile conditions in special nutrient\n\nmedia. This capacity to generate a whole plant from any cell/explant is\n\ncalled totipotency. You will learn how to accomplish this in higher\n\nclasses. It is important to stress here that the nutrient medium must\n\nprovide a carbon source such as sucrose and also inorganic salts,\n\nvitamins, amino acids and growth regulators like auxins, cytokinins\n\netc. By application of these methods it is possible to achieve propagation\n\nof a large number of plants in very short durations. This method of\n\nproducing thousands of plants through tissue culture is called micro-\n\npropagation. Each of these plants will be genetically identical to the\n\noriginal plant from which they were grown, i.e., they are somaclones.\n\nMany important food plants like tomato, banana, apple, etc., have been\n\nproduced on commercial scale using this method. Try to visit a tissue\n\nculture laboratory with your teacher to better understand and appreciate\n\nthe process.\n\nAnother important application of the method is the recovery of\n\nhealthy plants from diseased plants. Even if the plant is infected with a\n\nvirus, the meristem (apical and axillary) is free of virus. Hence, one\n\ncan remove the  meristem and grow it in vitro to obtain virus-free plants.\n\nScientists have succeeded in culturing meristems of banana, sugarcane,\n\npotato, etc.\n\nScientists have even isolated single cells from plants and after\n\ndigesting their cell walls have been able to isolate naked protoplasts\n\n(surrounded by plasma membranes).  Isolated protoplasts from two\n\ndifferent varieties of plants – each having a desirable character – can be\n\nfused to get hybrid protoplasts, which can be further grown to form a\n\nnew plant. These hybrids are called somatic hybrids while the process\n\nis called somatic hybridisation. Imagine a situation when a protoplast\n\nof tomato is fused with that of potato, and then they are grown – to form\n\nnew hybrid plants combining tomato and potato characteristics. Well,\n\nthis has been achieved – resulting in formation of pomato; unfortunately\n\nthis plant did not have all the desired combination of characteristics for\n\nits commercial utilisation.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n178\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1.

Name any five hybrid varieties of crop plants which have been developed\nin India.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nAnimal husbandry is the practice of taking care and breeding domestic\n\nanimals by applying scientific principles. The ever-increasing demand\n\nof food from animals and animal products both in terms of quality and\n\nquantity has been met by good animal husbandry practices. These\n\npractices include (i) management of farm and farm animals, and (ii)\n\nanimal breeding. In view of the high nutritive value of honey and its\n\nmedicinal importance, there has been a remarkable growth in the practice\n\nof bee-keeping or apiculture. Fishery is another flourishing industry\n\nmeeting the ever-increasing demand for fish, fish products and other\n\naquatic foods.\n\nPlant breeding may be used to create varieties, which are resistant\n\nto pathogens and to insect pests. This increases the yield of the food.\n\nThis method has also been used to increase the protein content of the\n\nplant foods and thereby enhance the quality of food. In India, several\n\nvarieties of different crop plants have been produced. All these measures\n\nenhance the production of food. Techniques of tissue culture and\n\nsomatic hybridisation offer vast potential for manipulation of plants in\n\nvitro to produce new varieties.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMICROBES IN HUMAN WELFARE.pmd\n\n\nBesides macroscopic plants and animals, microbes are\n\nthe major components of biological systems on this earth.\n\nYou have studied about the diversity of living organisms\n\nin Class XI. Do you remember which Kingdoms among\n\nthe living organisms contain micro-organisms? Which are\n\nthe ones that are only microscopic? Microbes are present\n\neverywhere – in soil, water, air, inside our bodies and that\n\nof other animals and plants. They are present even at sites\n\nwhere no other life-form could possibly exist–sites such\n\nas deep inside the geysers (thermal vents) where the\n\ntemperature may be as high as 1000C, deep in the soil,\n\nunder the layers of snow several metres thick, and in highly\n\nacidic environments. Microbes are diverse–protozoa,\n\nbacteria, fungi and microscopic animal and plant viruses,\n\nviroids and also prions that are proteinacious infectious\n\nagents. Some of the microbes are shown in Figures 10.1\n\nand 10.2.\n\nMicrobes like bacteria and many fungi can be grown\n\non nutritive media to form colonies (Figure 10.3), that can\n\nbe seen with the naked eyes.  Such cultures are useful in\n\nstudies on micro-organisms.\n\nCHAPTER 10\n\nMICROBES IN HUMAN WELFARE\n\n10.1 Microbes in Household\n\nProducts\n\n10.2 Microbes in Industrial\n\nProducts\n\n10.3 Microbes in Sewage\n\nTreatment\n\n10.4 Microbes in Production of\n\nBiogas\n\n10.5 Microbes as Biocontrol\n\nAgents\n\n10.6 Microbes as Biofertilisers\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n180\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 10.3 (a) Colonies of bacteria growing in a petri dish;\n(b) Fungal colony growing in a petri dish\n\n(a) (b)\n\n(c)\nFigure10.1 Bacteria: (a) Rod-shaped,\nmagnified 1500X; (b) Spherical\nshaped, magnified1500X; (c) A rod-\nshaped bacterium showing flagella,\nmagnified 50,000X\n\nFigure 10.2 Viruses: (a) A bacteriophage; (b)\nAdenovirus which causes respiratory\ninfections; (c) Rod-shaped Tobacco\nMosaic Virus (TMV).

They also cause diseases in animals and plants.\n\nBut this should not make you think that all microbes are harmful; several\n\nmicrobes are useful to man in diverse ways. Some of the most important\n\ncontributions of microbes to human welfare are discussed in this chapter.\n\n10.1 MICROBES IN HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTS\n\nYou would be surprised to know that we use microbes or products\n\nderived from them everyday. A common example is the production of\n\ncurd from milk. Micro-organisms such as Lactobacillus and others\n\ncommonly called lactic acid bacteria (LAB) grow in milk and convert it\n\nto curd. During growth, the LAB produce acids that coagulate and\n\npartially digest the milk proteins. A small amount of curd added to the\n\nfresh milk as inoculum or starter contain millions of LAB, which at\n\nsuitable temperatures multiply, thus converting milk to curd, which\n\nalso improves its nutritional quality by increasing vitamin B\n12\n\n. In our\n\nstomach too, the LAB play very beneficial role in checking disease-\n\ncausing microbes.\n\nThe dough, which is used for making foods such as dosa and idli  is\n\nalso fermented by bacteria. The puffed-up appearance of dough is due to\n\nthe production of  CO\n2\n gas.  Can you tell which metabolic pathway is\n\ntaking place resulting in the formation of CO\n2\n? Where do you think the\n\nbacteria for these fermentations come from?  Similarly the dough, which\n\nis used for making bread, is fermented using baker’s yeast\n\n(Saccharomyces cerevisiae). A number of traditional drinks and foods\n\nare also made by fermentation by the microbes. ‘Toddy’, a traditional\n\ndrink of some parts of southern India is made by fermenting sap from\n\npalms. Microbes are also used to ferment fish, soyabean and bamboo-\n\nshoots to make foods. Cheese, is one of the oldest food items in which\n\nmicrobes were used. Different varieties of cheese are known by their\n\ncharacteristic texture, flavour and taste, the specificity coming from the\n\nmicrobes used. For example, the large holes in ‘Swiss cheese’ are due to\n\nproduction of a large amount of CO\n2\n by a bacterium named\n\nPropionibacterium sharmanii.  The ‘Roquefort cheese’ are ripened by\n\ngrowing a specific fungi on them, which gives them a particular flavour.\n\n10.2 MICROBES IN INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS\n\nEven in industry, microbes are used to synthesise a number of products\n\nvaluable to human beings. Beverages and antibiotics are some examples.\n\nProduction on an industrial scale, requires growing microbes in very large\n\nvessels called fermentors (Figure 10.4).\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n182\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n10.2.1 Fermented Beverages\n\nMicrobes especially yeasts have been used from\n\ntime immemorial for the production of beverages\n\nlike wine, beer, whisky, brandy or rum. For this\n\npurpose the same yeast Saccharomyces\n\ncerevisiae used for bread-making and\n\ncommonly called brewer’s yeast, is used for\n\nfermenting malted cereals and fruit juices, to\n\nproduce ethanol. Do you recollect the metabolic\n\nreactions, which result in the production of\n\nethanol by yeast? Depending on the type of the\n\nraw material used for fermentation and the type\n\nof processing (with or without distillation)\n\ndifferent types of alcoholic drinks are obtained.\n\nWine and beer are produced without distillation\n\nwhereas whisky, brandy and rum are produced\n\nby distillation of the fermented broth. The\n\nphotograph of a fermentation plant is shown in\n\nFigure 10.5.\n\n10.2.2 Antibiotics\n\nAntibiotics produced by microbes are regarded\n\nas one of the most significant discoveries of the\n\ntwentieth century and have greatly contributed\n\ntowards the welfare of the human society. Anti is\n\na Greek word that means ‘against’, and bio means\n\n‘life’, together they mean ‘against life’ (in the\n\ncontext of disease causing organisms); whereas with reference to human\n\nbeings, they are ‘pro life’ and not against. Antibiotics are chemical\n\nsubstances, which are produced by some microbes and can kill or retard\n\nthe growth of other (disease-causing) microbes.\n\nYou are familiar with the commonly used antibiotic Penicillin. Do you\n\nknow that Penicillin was the first antibiotic to be discovered, and it was a\n\nchance discovery?  Alexander Fleming while working on Staphylococci\n\nbacteria, once observed a mould growing in one of his unwashed culture\n\nplates around which Staphylococci could not grow. He found out that it\n\nwas due to a chemical produced by the mould and he named it Penicillin\n\nafter the mould Penicillium notatum. However, its full potential as an\n\neffective antibiotic was established much later by Ernest Chain and\n\nHoward Florey. This antibiotic  was extensively used to treat American\n\nsoldiers wounded in World War II. Fleming, Chain and Florey were awarded\n\nthe Nobel Prize in 1945, for this discovery.\n\nFigure 10.5 Fermentation Plant\n\nFigure 10.4 Fermentors\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n183\n\nMICROBES IN HUMAN WELFARE\n\nAfter Penicillin, other antibiotics were also purified from other\n\nmicrobes. Can you name some other antibiotics and find out their\n\nsources? Antibiotics have greatly improved our capacity to treat deadly\n\ndiseases such as plague, whooping cough (kali khansi ), diphtheria (gal\n\nghotu) and leprosy (kusht rog), which used to kill millions all over the\n\nglobe. Today, we cannot imagine a world without antibiotics.\n\n10.2.3 Chemicals, Enzymes and other Bioactive Molecules\n\nMicrobes are also used for commercial and industrial production of\n\ncertain chemicals like organic acids, alcohols and enzymes. Examples of\n\nacid producers are Aspergillus niger (a fungus) of citric acid, Acetobacter\n\naceti (a bacterium) of acetic acid; Clostridium butylicum (a bacterium) of\n\nbutyric acid and Lactobacillus (a bacterium) of lactic acid.\n\nYeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) is used for commercial production\n\nof ethanol. Microbes are also used for production of enzymes. Lipases are\n\nused in detergent formulations and are helpful in removing oily stains\n\nfrom the laundry. You must have noticed that bottled fruit juices bought\n\nfrom the market are clearer as compared to those made at home. This is\n\nbecause the bottled juices are clarified by the use of pectinases and\n\nproteases. Streptokinase produced by the bacterium Streptococcus and\n\nmodified by genetic engineering is used as a ‘clot buster’ for removing\n\nclots from the blood vessels of patients who have undergone myocardial\n\ninfarction leading to heart attack.\n\nAnother bioactive molecule, cyclosporin A, that is used as an\n\nimmunosuppressive agent in organ-transplant patients, is produced by\n\nthe fungus Trichoderma polysporum. Statins produced by the yeast\n\nMonascus purpureus have been commercialised as blood-cholesterol\n\nlowering agents. It acts by competitively inhibiting the enzyme responsible\n\nfor synthesis of cholesterol.\n\n10.3 MICROBES IN SEWAGE TREATMENT\n\nWe know that large quantities of waste water are generated everyday in\n\ncities and towns. A major component of this waste water is human excreta.\n\nThis municipal waste-water is also called sewage. It contains large\n\namounts of organic matter and microbes. Many of which are pathogenic.\n\nHave you ever wondered where this huge quantity of sewage or urban\n\nwaste water is disposed off daily? This cannot be discharged into natural\n\nwater bodies like rivers and streams directly – you can understand why.\n\nBefore disposal, hence, sewage is treated in sewage treatment plants (STPs)\n\nto make it less polluting. Treatment of waste water is done by the\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n184\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nheterotrophic microbes naturally present in\n\nthe sewage. This treatment is carried out in\n\ntwo stages:\n\nPrimary treatment : These treatment\n\nsteps basically involve physical removal of\n\nparticles – large and small – from the sewage\n\nthrough filtration and sedimentation. These\n\nare removed in stages; initially, floating debris\n\nis removed by sequential filtration. Then the\n\ngrit (soil and small pebbles) are removed by\n\nsedimentation. All solids that settle form the\n\nprimary sludge, and the supernatant forms\n\nthe effluent.  The effluent from the primary\n\nsettling tank is taken for secondary treatment.\n\nSecondary treatment or Biological treatment : The primary\n\neffluent is passed into large aeration tanks (Figure 10.6) where it is\n\nconstantly agitated mechanically and air is pumped into it. This allows\n\nvigorous growth of useful aerobic microbes into flocs (masses of\n\nbacteria associated with fungal filaments to form mesh like\n\nstructures). While growing, these microbes consume the major part\n\nof the organic matter in the effluent. This significantly reduces the\n\nBOD (biochemical oxygen demand) of the effluent. BOD refers to\n\nthe amount of the oxygen that would be consumed if all the organic\n\nmatter in one liter of water were oxidised by bacteria. The sewage\n\nwater is treated till the BOD is reduced. The BOD test measures the\n\nrate of uptake of oxygen by micro-organisms in a sample of water\n\nand thus, indirectly, BOD is a measure of the organic matter present\n\nin the water. The greater the BOD of waste water, more is its polluting\n\npotential.\n\nOnce the BOD of sewage or waste water is reduced significantly, the\n\neffluent is then passed into a settling tank where the bacterial ‘flocs’ are\n\nallowed to sediment. This sediment is called activated sludge. A small\n\npart of the activated sludge is pumped back into the aeration tank to\n\nserve as the inoculum. The remaining major part of the sludge is pumped\n\ninto large tanks called anaerobic sludge digesters. Here, other kinds\n\nof bacteria, which grow anaerobically, digest the bacteria and the fungi\n\nin the sludge. During this digestion, bacteria produce a mixture of gases\n\nsuch as methane, hydrogen sulphide and carbon dioxide. These gases\n\nform biogas and can be used as source of energy as it is inflammable.\n\nThe effluent from the secondary treatment plant is generally released\n\ninto natural water bodies like rivers and streams. An aerial view of such\n\na plant is shown in Figure 10.7.\n\nFigure 10.6 Secondary treatment\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n185\n\nMICROBES IN HUMAN WELFARE\n\nYou can appreciate how microbes play a major\n\nrole in treating millions of gallons of waste water\n\neveryday across the globe. This methodology has\n\nbeen practiced for more than a century now, in\n\nalmost all parts of the world. Till date, no man-\n\nmade technology has been able to rival the\n\nmicrobial treatment of sewage.\n\nYou are aware that due to increasing\n\nurbanisation, sewage is being produced in much\n\nlarger quantities than ever before. However the\n\nnumber of sewage treatment plants has not\n\nincreased enough to treat such large quantities.\n\nSo the untreated sewage is often discharged directly into rivers leading to\n\ntheir pollution and increase in water-borne diseases.\n\nThe Ministry of Environment and Forests has initiated Ganga Action\n\nPlan and Yamuna Action Plan to save these major rivers of our country\n\nfrom pollution. Under these plans, it is proposed to build a large number\n\nof sewage treatment plants so that only treated sewage may be discharged\n\nin the rivers. A visit to a sewage treatment plant situated in any place\n\nnear you would be a very interesting and educating experience.\n\n10.4 MICROBES IN PRODUCTION OF BIOGAS\n\nBiogas is a mixture of gases (containing predominantly methane) produced\n\nby the microbial activity and which may be used as fuel. You have learnt\n\nthat microbes produce different types of gaseous end-products during\n\ngrowth and metabolism. The type of the gas produced depends upon the\n\nmicrobes and the organic substrates they utilise. In the examples cited in\n\nrelation to fermentation of dough, cheese making and production of\n\nbeverages, the main gas produced was CO\n2.\n. However, certain bacteria,\n\nwhich grow anaerobically on cellulosic material, produce large amount\n\nof methane along with CO\n2\n and H\n\n2\n. These bacteria are collectively called\n\nmethanogens, and one such common bacterium is Methanobacterium.\n\nThese bacteria are commonly found in the anaerobic sludge during\n\nsewage treatment. These bacteria are also present in the rumen (a part of\n\nstomach) of cattle. A lot of cellulosic material present in the food of cattle\n\nis also present in the rumen. In rumen, these bacteria help in the\n\nbreakdown of cellulose and play an important role in the nutrition of\n\ncattle. Do you think we, human beings, are able to digest the celluose\n\npresent in our foods? Thus, the excreta (dung) of cattle, commonly called\n\ngobar, is rich in these bacteria. Dung can be used for generation of biogas,\n\ncommonly called gobar gas.\n\nThe biogas plant consists of a concrete tank (10-15 feet deep) in which\n\nbio-wastes are collected and a slurry of dung is fed. A floating cover is\n\nFigure 10.7 An aerial view of a sewage plant\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n186\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nplaced over the slurry, which\n\nkeeps on rising as the gas is\n\nproduced in the tank due to the\n\nmicrobial activity. The biogas\n\nplant has an outlet, which is\n\nconnected to a pipe to supply\n\nbiogas to nearby houses. The\n\nspent slurry is removed through\n\nanother outlet and may be used\n\nas fertiliser. Cattle dung is\n\navailable in large quantities in\n\nrural areas where cattle are used\n\nfor a variety of purposes. So\n\nbiogas plants are more often\n\nbuilt in rural areas. The biogas\n\nthus produced is used for\n\ncooking and lighting. The\n\npicture of a biogas plant is\n\nshown in Figure 10.8. The\n\ntechnology of biogas production\n\nwas developed in India mainly\n\ndue to the efforts of Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) and\n\nKhadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC). If your school is situated\n\nin a village or near a village, it would be very interesting to enquire if there\n\nare any biogas plants nearby.  Visit the biogas plant and learn more about\n\nit from the people who are actually managing it.\n\n10.5 MICROBES AS BIOCONTROL AGENTS\n\nBiocontrol refers to the use of biological methods for controlling plant\n\ndiseases and pests. In modern society, these problems have been tackled\n\nincreasingly by the use of chemicals – by use of insecticides and pesticides.\n\nThese chemicals are toxic and extremely harmful, to human beings and\n\nanimals alike, and have been polluting our environment (soil, ground\n\nwater), fruits, vegetables and crop plants. Our soil is also polluted through\n\nour use of weedicides to remove weeds.\n\nBiological control of pests and diseases: In agriculture, there is a\n\nmethod of controlling pests that relies on natural predation rather than\n\nintroduced chemicals. A key belief of the organic farmer is that biodiversity\n\nfurthers health. The more variety a landscape has, the more sustainable\n\nit is. The organic farmer, therefore, works to create a system where the\n\ninsects that are sometimes called pests are not eradicated, but instead\n\nare kept at manageable levels by a complex system of checks and balances\n\nwithin a living and vibrant ecosystem. Contrary to the ‘conventional’\n\nfarming practices which often use chemical methods to kill both useful\n\nFigure 10.8 A typical biogas plant\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n187\n\nMICROBES IN HUMAN WELFARE\n\nand harmful life forms indiscriminately, this is a holistic approach that\n\nseeks to develop an understanding of the webs of interaction between the\n\nmyriad of organisms that constitute the field fauna and flora. The organic\n\nfarmer holds the view that the eradication of the creatures that are often\n\ndescribed as pests is not only possible, but also undesirable, for without\n\nthem the beneficial predatory and parasitic insects which depend upon\n\nthem as food or hosts would not be able to survive. Thus, the use of\n\nbiocontrol measures will greatly reduce our dependence on toxic chemicals\n\nand pesticides. An important part of the biological farming approach is\n\nto become familiar with the various life forms that inhabit the field,\n\npredators as well as pests, and also their life cycles, patterns of feeding\n\nand the habitats that they prefer. This will help develop appropriate means\n\nof biocontrol.\n\nThe very familiar beetle with red and black markings – the Ladybird,\n\nand Dragonflies are useful to get rid of aphids and mosquitoes,\n\nrespectively. An example of microbial biocontrol agents that can be\n\nintroduced in order to control butterfly caterpillars is the bacteria Bacillus\n\nthuringiensis (often written as Bt ). These are available in sachets as dried\n\nspores which are mixed with water and sprayed onto vulnerable plants\n\nsuch as brassicas and fruit trees, where these are eaten by the insect\n\nlarvae. In the gut of the larvae, the toxin is released and the larvae get\n\nkilled. The bacterial disease will kill the caterpillars, but leave other insects\n\nunharmed. Because of the development of methods of genetic engineering\n\nin the last decade or so, the scientists have introduced B. thuringiensis\n\ntoxin genes into plants. Such plants are resistant to attack by insect pests.\n\nBt-cotton is one such example, which is being cultivated in some states\n\nof our country. You will learn more about this in chapter 12.\n\nA biological control being developed for use in the treatment of plant\n\ndisease is the fungus Trichoderma. Trichoderma species are free-living\n\nfungi that are very common in the root ecosystems. They are effective\n\nbiocontrol agents of several plant pathogens.\n\nBaculoviruses are pathogens that attack insects and other arthropods.\n\nThe majority of baculoviruses used as biological control agents are in the\n\ngenus Nucleopolyhedrovirus. These viruses are excellent candidates for\n\nspecies-specific, narrow spectrum insecticidal applications. They have\n\nbeen shown to have no negative impacts on plants, mammals, birds, fish\n\nor even on non-target insects. This is especially desirable when beneficial\n\ninsects are being conserved to aid in an overall integrated pest\n\nmanagement (IPM) programme, or when an ecologically sensitive area is\n\nbeing treated.\n\n10.6 MICROBES AS BIOFERTILISERS\n\nWith our present day life styles environmental pollution is a major cause\n\nof concern. The use of the chemical fertilisers to meet the ever-increasing\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n188\n\nBIOLOGY\n\ndemand of agricultural produce has contributed significantly to\n\nthis pollution. Of course,  we have now realised that there are problems\n\nassociated with the overuse of chemical fertilisers and there is a\n\nlarge pressure to switch to organic farming – the use of biofertilisers.\n\nBiofertilisers  are organisms that enrich the nutrient quality of the soil.\n\nThe main sources of biofertilisers are bacteria, fungi and cyanobacteria.\n\nYou have studied about the nodules on the roots of leguminous plants\n\nformed by the symbiotic association of Rhizobium. These bacteria fix\n\natmospheric nitrogen into organic forms, which is used by the plant as\n\nnutrient. Other bacteria can fix atmospheric nitrogen while free-living in\n\nthe soil (examples Azospirillum and Azotobacter), thus enriching the\n\nnitrogen content of the soil.\n\nFungi are also known to form symbiotic associations with plants\n\n(mycorrhiza). Many members of the genus Glomus  form mycorrhiza.\n\nThe fungal symbiont in these associations absorbs phosphorus from\n\nsoil and passes it to the plant. Plants having such associations show\n\nother benefits also, such as resistance to root-borne pathogens, tolerance\n\nto salinity and drought, and an overall increase in plant growth and\n\ndevelopment. Can you tell what advantage the fungus derives from\n\nthis association?\n\nCyanobacteria are autotrophic microbes widely distributed in aquatic\n\nand terrestrial environments many of which can fix atmospheric nitrogen,\n\ne.g. Anabaena, Nostoc, Oscillatoria, etc. In paddy fields, cyanobacteria\n\nserve as an important biofertiliser. Blue green algae also add organic matter\n\nto the soil and increase its fertility. Currently, in our country, a number\n\nof biofertilisers are available commercially in the market and farmers use\n\nthese regularly in their fields to replenish soil nutrients and to reduce\n\ndependence on chemical fertilisers.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nMicrobes are a very important component of life on earth. Not all\n\nmicrobes are pathogenic. Many microbes are very useful to human\n\nbeings. We use microbes and microbially derived products almost every\n\nday. Bacteria called lactic acid bacteria (LAB) grow in milk to convert it\n\ninto curd. The dough, which is used to make bread, is fermented by\n\nyeast called Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Certain dishes such as idli and\n\ndosa, are made from dough fermented by microbes. Bacteria and fungi\n\nare used to impart particular texture, taste and flavor to cheese. Microbes\n\nare used to produce industrial products like lactic acid, acetic acid\n\nand alcohol, which are used in a variety of processes in the industry.\n\nAntibiotics like penicillins produced by useful microbes are used to kill\n\ndisease-causing harmful microbes. Antibiotics have played a major role\n\nin controlling infectious diseases like diphtheria, whooping cough and\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n189\n\nMICROBES IN HUMAN WELFARE\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1. Bacteria cannot be seen with the naked eyes, but these can be seen\n\nwith the help of a microscope. If you have to carry a sample from your\n\nhome to your biology laboratory to demonstrate the presence of microbes\n\nwith the help of a microscope, which sample would you carry and why?\n\n2. Give examples to prove that microbes release gases during metabolism.\n\n3. In which food would you find lactic acid bacteria? Mention some of\n\ntheir useful applications.\n\n4. Name some traditional Indian foods made of wheat, rice and Bengal\n\ngram (or their products) which involve use of microbes.\n\n5. In which way have microbes played a major role in controlling diseases\n\ncaused by harmful bacteria?\n\n6. Name any two species of fungus, which are used in the production of\n\nthe antibiotics.\n\n7. What is sewage? In which way can sewage be harmful to us?\n\n8. What is the key difference between primary and secondary sewage\n\ntreatment?\n\n9. Do you think microbes can also be used as source of energy? If yes, how?\n\n10. Microbes can be used to decrease the use of chemical fertilisers and\n\npesticides. Explain how this can be accomplished.\n\n11. Three water samples namely river water, untreated sewage water and\n\nsecondary effluent discharged from a sewage treatment plant were\n\nsubjected to BOD test. The samples were labelled A, B and C; but the\n\nlaboratory attendant did not note which was which.  The BOD values\n\nof the three samples A, B and C were recorded as 20mg/L, 8mg/L and\n\n400mg/L, respectively. Which sample of the water is most polluted?\n\nCan you assign the correct label to each assuming the river water is\n\nrelatively clean?\n\npneumonia. For more than a hundred years, microbes are being used\n\nto treat sewage (waste water) by the process of activated sludge formation\n\nand this helps in recycling of water in nature. Methanogens produce\n\nmethane (biogas) while degrading plant waste. Biogas produced by\n\nmicrobes is used as a source of energy in rural areas. Microbes can also\n\nbe used to kill harmful pests, a process called as biocontrol. The\n\nbiocontrol measures help us to avoid heavy use of toxic pesticides for\n\ncontrolling pests. There is a need these days to push for use of\n\nbiofertilisers in place of chemical fertilisers.  It is clear from the diverse\n\nuses human beings have put microbes to that they play an important\n\nrole in the welfare of human society.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n190\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n12. Find out the name of the microbes from which Cyclosporin A (an\n\nimmunosuppressive drug) and Statins (blood cholesterol lowering\n\nagents) are obtained.\n\n13.

How do biofertilisers enrich the fertility of the soil?\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinciples and Processes in Biotechnology.pmd\n\n\nEver since the days of Rene Descartes, the French philosopher,\n\nmathematician and biologist of seventeenth century, all human\n\nknowledge especially natural sciences were directed to develop\n\ntechnologies which add to the creature comforts of human\n\nlives, as also value to human life. The whole approach to\n\nunderstanding natural phenomena became anthropocentric.\n\nPhysics and chemistry gave rise to engineering, technologies\n\nand industries which all worked for human comfort and welfare.\n\nThe major utility of the biological world is as a source of food.\n\nBiotechnology, the twentieth century off-shoot of modern\n\nbiology, changed our daily life as its products  brought\n\nqualitative improvement in health and food production. The\n\nbasic principles underlying biotechnological processes and some\n\napplications are highlighted and discussed in this unit.\n\nChapter 11\n\nBiotechnology : Principles and\n\nProcesses\n\nChapter 12\n\nBiotechnology and Its\n\nApplications\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nHerbert Boyer was born in 1936 and brought up in a corner of western\n\nPennsylvania where railroads and mines were the destiny of most young\n\nmen. He completed graduate work at the University of Pittsburgh, in\n\n1963, followed by three years of post-graduate studies at Yale.\n\nIn 1966, Boyer took over assistant professorship at the University of\n\nCalifornia at San Francisco. By 1969, he performed studies on a couple\n\nof restriction enzymes of the E. coli bacterium with especially useful\n\nproperties. Boyer observed that these enzymes have the capability of\n\ncutting DNA strands in a particular fashion, which left what has became\n\nknown as ‘sticky ends’ on the strands. These clipped ends made pasting\n\ntogether pieces of DNA a precise exercise.\n\nThis discovery, in turn, led to a rich and rewarding conversation in\n\nHawaii with a Stanford scientist named Stanley Cohen. Cohen had\n\nbeen studying small ringlets of DNA called plasmids and which float\n\nabout freely in the cytoplasm of certain bacterial cells and  replicate\n\nindependently from the coding strand of DNA. Cohen had developed\n\na method of removing these plasmids from the cell and then reinserting\n\nthem in other cells. Combining this process with that of DNA splicing\n\nenabled Boyer and Cohen to recombine segments of DNA in desired\n\nconfigurations and insert the DNA in bacterial cells, which could then\n\nact as manufacturing plants for specific proteins. This breakthrough was\n\nthe basis upon which the discipline of biotechnology was founded.\n\nHERBERT BOYER\n(1936 )\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nBiotechnology deals with techniques of using live\n\norganisms or enzymes from organisms to produce products\nand processes useful to humans. In this sense, making\ncurd, bread or wine, which are all microbe-mediated\nprocesses, could also be thought as a form of\nbiotechnology. However, it is used in a restricted sense\ntoday, to refer to such of those processes which use\ngenetically modified organisms to achieve the same on a\nlarger scale. Further, many other processes/techniques are\nalso included under biotechnology. For example, in vitro\nfertilisation leading to a ‘test-tube’ baby, synthesising a\ngene and using it, developing a DNA vaccine or correcting\na defective gene, are all part of biotechnology.\n\nThe European Federation of Biotechnology (EFB) has\ngiven a definition of biotechnology that encompasses both\ntraditional view and modern molecular biotechnology.\nThe definition given by EFB is as follows:\n\n‘The integration of natural science and organisms,\ncells, parts thereof, and molecular analogues for products\nand services’.\n\n11.1 PRINCIPLES OF BIOTECHNOLOGY\n\nAmong many, the two core techniques that enabled birth\nof modern biotechnology are :\n\n(i) Genetic engineering : Techniques to alter the\n\nchemistry of genetic material (DNA and RNA),\n\nCHAPTER 11\n\nBIOTECHNOLOGY : PRINCIPLES\n\nAND PROCESSES\n\n11.1 Principles of Biotechnology\n\n11.2 Tools of Recombinant DNA\n\nTechnology\n\n11.3 Processes of Recombinant\n\nDNA Technology\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n194\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nto introduce these into host organisms and thus change the\n\nphenotype of the host organism.\n\n(ii) Bioprocess engineering : Maintenance of sterile (microbial\n\ncontamination-free) ambience in chemical engineering processes\n\nto enable growth of only the desired microbe/eukaryotic cell in\n\nlarge quantities for the manufacture of biotechnological products\n\nlike antibiotics, vaccines, enzymes, etc.\n\nLet us now understand the conceptual development of the  principles\n\nof genetic engineering.\n\nYou probably appreciate the advantages of sexual reproduction over\n\nasexual reproduction. The former provides opportunities for variations\n\nand formulation of unique combinations of genetic setup, some of which\n\nmay be beneficial to the organism as well as the population. Asexual\n\nreproduction preserves the genetic information, while sexual reproduction\n\npermits variation. Traditional hybridisation procedures used in plant and\n\nanimal breeding, very often lead to inclusion and multiplication of\n\nundesirable genes along with the desired genes. The techniques of genetic\n\nengineering which include creation of  recombinant DNA, use of\n\ngene cloning and gene transfer, overcome this limitation and allows us\n\nto isolate and introduce only one or a set of desirable genes without\n\nintroducing undesirable genes into the target organism.\n\nDo you know the likely fate of a piece of DNA, which is somehow\n\ntransferred into an alien organism? Most likely, this piece of DNA would\n\nnot be able to multiply itself in the progeny cells of the organism. But,\n\nwhen it gets integrated into the genome of the recipient, it may multiply\n\nand be inherited along with the host DNA.  This is because the alien piece\n\nof DNA has become part of a chromosome, which has the ability to\n\nreplicate.  In a chromosome there is a specific DNA sequence called the\n\norigin of replication, which is responsible for initiating replication.\n\nTherefore, for the multiplication of any alien piece of DNA in an organism\n\nit needs to be a part of a chromosome(s) which has a specific sequence\n\nknown as ‘origin of replication’. Thus, an alien DNA is linked with the\n\norigin of replication, so that, this alien piece of DNA can replicate and\n\nmultiply itself in the host organism. This can also be called as cloning or\n\nmaking multiple identical copies of any template DNA.\n\nLet us now focus on the first instance of the construction of an artificial\n\nrecombinant DNA molecule. The construction of the first recombinant\n\nDNA emerged from the possibility of linking a gene encoding antibiotic\n\nresistance with a native plasmid (autonomously replicating circular\n\nextra-chromosomal DNA) of Salmonella typhimurium. Stanley Cohen and\n\nHerbert Boyer accomplished this in 1972 by isolating the antibiotic\n\nresistance gene by cutting out a piece of DNA from a plasmid which was\n\nresponsible for conferring antibiotic resistance. The cutting of DNA at\n\nspecific locations became possible with the discovery of the so-called\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n BIOTECHNOLOGY : PRINCIPLES AND PROCESSES\n\n195\n\n‘molecular scissors’– restriction enzymes. The cut piece of DNA was\n\nthen linked with the plasmid DNA. These plasmid DNA act as vectors to\n\ntransfer the piece of DNA attached to it.  You probably know that mosquito\n\nacts as an insect vector to transfer the malarial parasite into human body.\n\nIn the same way, a plasmid can be used as vector to deliver an alien piece\n\nof DNA into the host organism. The linking of antibiotic resistance gene\n\nwith the plasmid vector became possible with the enzyme DNA ligase,\n\nwhich acts on cut DNA molecules and joins their ends. This makes a new\n\ncombination of circular autonomously replicating DNA created in vitro\n\nand is known as recombinant DNA. When this DNA is transferred into\n\nEscherichia coli, a bacterium closely related to Salmonella, it could\n\nreplicate using the new host’s DNA polymerase enzyme and make multiple\n\ncopies. The ability to multiply copies of antibiotic resistance gene in\n\nE. coli was called cloning of antibiotic resistance gene in E. coli.\n\nYou can hence infer that there are three basic steps in genetically\n\nmodifying an organism —\n\n(i) identification of DNA with desirable genes;\n\n(ii) introduction of the identified DNA into the host;\n\n(iii) maintenance of introduced DNA in the host and transfer of the DNA\n\nto its progeny.\n\n11.2 TOOLS OF RECOMBINANT DNA TECHNOLOGY\n\nNow we know from the foregoing discussion that genetic engineering or\n\nrecombinant DNA technology can be accomplished only if we have the\n\nkey tools, i.e., restriction enzymes, polymerase enzymes, ligases, vectors\n\nand the host organism. Let us try to understand some of these in detail.\n\n11.2.1 Restriction Enzymes\n\nIn the year 1963, the two enzymes responsible for restricting the growth\n\nof bacteriophage in Escherichia coli were isolated. One of these added\n\nmethyl groups to DNA, while the other cut DNA. The later was called\n\nrestriction endonuclease.\n\nThe first restriction endonuclease–Hind II, whose functioning\n\ndepended on a specific DNA nucleotide sequence was isolated and\n\ncharacterised five years later. It was found that Hind II always cut DNA\n\nmolecules at a particular point by recognising a specific sequence of\n\nsix base pairs. This specific base sequence is known as the\n\nrecognition sequence for Hind II. Besides Hind II, today we know more\n\nthan 900 restriction enzymes that have been isolated from over 230 strains\n\nof bacteria each of which recognise different recognition sequences.\n\nThe convention for naming these enzymes is the first letter of the name\n\ncomes from the genus and the second two letters come from the species of\n\nthe prokaryotic cell from which they were isolated, e.g., EcoRI comes from\n\nEscherichia coli RY 13. In EcoRI, the letter ‘R’ is derived from the name of\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n196\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nstrain. Roman numbers following the names indicate the order in which\n\nthe enzymes were isolated from that strain of bacteria.\n\nRestriction enzymes belong to a larger class of enzymes called\n\nnucleases. These are of two kinds; exonucleases and endonucleases.\n\nExonucleases remove nucleotides from the ends of the DNA whereas,\n\nendonucleases make cuts at specific positions within the DNA.\n\nEach restriction endonuclease functions by ‘inspecting’ the length of\n\na DNA sequence. Once it finds its specific recognition sequence, it\n\nwill bind to the DNA and cut each of the two strands of the double\n\nhelix at specific points in their sugar -phosphate backbones\n\n(Figure 11.1). Each restriction endonuclease recognises a specific\n\npalindromic nucleotide sequences in the DNA.\n\nFigure 11.1 Steps in formation of recombinant DNA by action of restriction endonuclease\nenzyme - EcoRI\n\nDo you know what palindromes are?  These are groups of letters\n\nthat form the same words when read both forward and backward,\n\ne.g., “MALAYALAM”. As against a word-palindrome where the same\n\nword is read in both directions, the palindrome in DNA is a sequence\n\nof base pairs that reads same on the two strands when orientation of\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n BIOTECHNOLOGY : PRINCIPLES AND PROCESSES\n\n197\n\nreading is kept the same. For example, the following sequences reads\n\nthe same on the two strands in 5'  à 3'  direction. This is also true if\n\nread in the 3'  à 5'  direction.\n\n5'  —— GAATTC ——  3'\n\n3'  —— CTTAAG —— 5'\n\nRestriction enzymes cut the strand of DNA a little away from the centre\n\nof the palindrome sites, but between the same two bases on the opposite\n\nstrands. This leaves single stranded portions at the ends. There are\n\noverhanging stretches called sticky ends on each strand (Figure 11.1).\n\nThese are named so because they form hydrogen bonds with their\n\ncomplementary cut counterparts. This stickiness of the ends facilitates\n\nthe action of the enzyme DNA ligase.\n\nRestriction endonucleases are used in genetic engineering to form\n\n‘recombinant’ molecules of DNA, which are composed of DNA from\n\ndifferent sources/genomes.\n\nWhen cut by the same restriction enzyme, the resultant DNA fragments\n\nhave the same kind of ‘sticky-ends’ and, these can be joined together\n\n(end-to-end) using DNA ligases (Figure 11.2).\n\nFigure 11.2 Diagrammatic representation of recombinant DNA technology\n\nRecombinant DNA\n\nMolecule\n\n(Cloning Host)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n198\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nYou may have realised that normally, unless one cuts the vector and\n\nthe source DNA with the same restriction enzyme, the recombinant vector\n\nmolecule cannot be created.\n\nSeparation and isolation of DNA fragments : The cutting of DNA by\n\nrestriction endonucleases results in the fragments of DNA. These fragments\n\ncan be separated by a technique known as gel electrophoresis. Since\n\nDNA fragments are negatively charged molecules they can be separated\n\nby forcing them to move towards the anode under an electric field through\n\na medium/matrix. Nowadays the most commonly used matrix is agarose\n\nwhich is a natural polymer extracted from sea weeds.  The DNA fragments\n\nseparate (resolve) according to their size through sieving effect provided\n\nby the agarose gel. Hence, the smaller the fragment size, the farther it\n\nmoves. Look at the Figure 11.3 and guess at which end of the gel the\n\nsample was loaded.\n\nThe separated DNA fragments can be\n\nvisualised only after staining the DNA\n\nwith a compound known as ethidium\n\nbromide followed by exposure to UV\n\nradiation (you cannot see pure DNA\n\nfragments in the visible light and\n\nwithout staining). You can see bright\n\norange coloured bands of DNA in a\n\nethidium bromide stained gel\n\nexposed to UV light (Figure 11.3). The\n\nseparated bands of DNA are cut out\n\nfrom the agarose gel and extracted\n\nfrom the gel piece. This step is known\n\nas elution. The DNA fragments\n\npurified in this way are used in\n\nconstructing recombinant DNA by\n\njoining them with cloning vectors.\n\n11.2.2 Cloning Vectors\n\nYou know that plasmids and bacteriophages have the ability to replicate\n\nwithin bacterial cells independent of the control of chromosomal DNA.\n\nBacteriophages because of their high number per cell, have very high\n\ncopy numbers of their genome within the bacterial cells. Some plasmids\n\nmay have only one or two copies per cell whereas others may have\n\n15-100 copies per cell. Their numbers can go even higher. If we are able\n\nto link an alien piece of DNA with bacteriophage or plasmid DNA, we can\n\nmultiply its numbers equal to the copy number of the plasmid or\n\nbacteriophage. Vectors used at present, are engineered in such a way\n\nthat they help easy linking of foreign DNA and selection of recombinants\n\nfrom non-recombinants.\n\nFigure 11.3 A typical agarose gel\nelectrophoresis showing\nmigration of undigested\n(lane 1) and digested set of\nDNA fragments (lane 2 to 4)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n BIOTECHNOLOGY : PRINCIPLES AND PROCESSES\n\n199\n\nThe following are the features that are required to facilitate cloning\n\ninto a vector.\n\n(i) Origin of replication (ori) : This is a sequence from where\n\nreplication starts and any piece of DNA when linked to this sequence\n\ncan be made to replicate within the host cells. This sequence is also\n\nresponsible for controlling the copy number of the linked DNA. So,\n\nif one wants to recover many copies of the target DNA it should be\n\ncloned in a vector whose origin support high copy number.\n\n(ii) Selectable marker : In addition to ‘ori’, the vector requires a\n\nselectable marker, which helps in identifying and eliminating non-\n\ntransformants and selectively permitting the growth of the\n\ntransformants.  Transformation is a procedure through which a\n\npiece of DNA is introduced in a host bacterium (you will study the\n\nprocess in subsequent section). Normally, the genes encoding\n\nresistance to antibiotics such as ampicillin, chloramphenicol,\n\ntetracycline or kanamycin, etc., are considered useful selectable\n\nmarkers for E. coli. The normal E. coli cells do not carry resistance\n\nagainst any of these antibiotics.\n\n(iii) Cloning sites: In order to link the\n\nalien DNA, the vector needs to have\n\nvery few, preferably single,\n\nrecognition sites for the commonly\n\nused restriction enzymes. Presence of\n\nmore than one recognition sites within\n\nthe vector will generate several\n\nfragments, which will complicate the\n\ngene cloning (Figure 11.4). The\n\nligation of alien DNA is carried out at\n\na restriction site present in one of the\n\ntwo antibiotic resistance genes. For\n\nexample, you can ligate a foreign DNA\n\nat the BamH I site of tetracycline\n\nresistance gene in the vector pBR322.\n\nThe recombinant plasmids will lose\n\ntetracycline resistance due to insertion\n\nof foreign DNA but can still be selected\n\nout from non-recombinant ones by\n\nplating the transformants on\n\ntetracycline containing medium. The transformants growing on\n\nampicillin containing medium are then transferred on a medium\n\ncontaining tetracycline. The recombinants will grow in ampicillin\n\ncontaining medium but not on that containing tetracycline. But,\n\nnon- recombinants will grow on the medium containing both the\n\nantibiotics. In this case, one antibiotic resistance gene helps in\n\nselecting the transformants, whereas the other antibiotic resistance\n\nFigure 11.4 E. coli cloning vector pBR322\nshowing restriction sites\n(Hind III, EcoR I, BamH I, Sal I,\nPvu II, Pst I, Cla I), ori and\nantibiotic resistance genes\n(ampR and tetR). rop codes for\nthe proteins involved in the\nreplication of the plasmid.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n200\n\nBIOLOGY\n\ngene gets ‘inactivated due to insertion’ of alien DNA, and helps in\n\nselection of recombinants.\n\nSelection of recombinants due to inactivation of antibiotics is a\n\ncumbersome procedure because it requires simultaneous plating\n\non two plates having different antibiotics. Therefore, alternative\n\nselectable markers have been developed which differentiate\n\nrecombinants from non-recombinants on the basis of their ability\n\nto produce colour in the presence of a chromogenic substrate. In\n\nthis, a recombinant DNA is inserted within the coding sequence of\n\nan enzyme, β-galactosidase.  This results into inactivation of the\n\ngene for synthesis of this enzyme, which is referred to as insertional\n\ninactivation. The presence of a chromogenic substrate gives blue\n\ncoloured colonies if the plasmid in the bacteria does not have an\n\ninsert. Presence of insert results into insertional inactivation of the\n\nβ-galactosidase gene and the colonies do not produce any colour,\n\nthese are identified as recombinant colonies.\n\n(iv) Vectors for cloning genes in plants and animals : You may be\n\nsurprised to know that we have learnt the lesson of transferring genes\n\ninto plants and animals from bacteria and viruses which have known\n\nthis for ages – how to deliver genes to transform eukaryotic cells and\n\nforce them to do what the bacteria or viruses want. For example,\n\nAgrobacterium tumifaciens, a pathogen of several dicot plants is able\n\nto deliver a piece of DNA known as ‘T-DNA’ to transform normal\n\nplant cells into a tumor and direct these tumor cells to produce the\n\nchemicals required by the pathogen. Similarly, retroviruses in animals\n\nhave the ability to transform normal cells into cancerous cells. A\n\nbetter understanding of the art of delivering genes by pathogens in\n\ntheir eukaryotic hosts has generated knowledge to transform these\n\ntools of pathogens into useful vectors for delivering genes of interest\n\nto humans. The tumor inducing (Ti) plasmid of Agrobacterium\n\ntumifaciens has now been modified into a cloning vector which is no\n\nmore pathogenic to the plants but is still able to use the mechanisms\n\nto deliver genes of our interest into a variety of plants. Similarly,\n\nretroviruses have also been disarmed and are now used to deliver\n\ndesirable genes into animal cells. So, once a gene or a DNA fragment\n\nhas been ligated into a suitable vector it is transferred into a bacterial,\n\nplant or animal host (where it multiplies).\n\n11.2.3 Competent Host (For Transformation with\nRecombinant DNA)\n\nSince DNA is a hydrophilic molecule, it cannot pass through cell\n\nmembranes. Why? In order to force bacteria to take up the plasmid, the\n\nbacterial cells must first be made ‘competent’ to take up DNA. This is\n\ndone by treating them with a specific concentration of a divalent cation,\n\nsuch as calcium, which increases the efficiency with which DNA enters\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n BIOTECHNOLOGY : PRINCIPLES AND PROCESSES\n\n201\n\nthe bacterium through pores in its cell wall. Recombinant DNA can then\n\nbe forced into such cells by incubating the cells with recombinant DNA\n\non ice, followed by placing them briefly at 420C (heat shock), and then\n\nputting them back on ice. This enables the bacteria to take up the\n\nrecombinant DNA.\n\nThis is not the only way to introduce alien DNA into host cells. In a\n\nmethod known as micro-injection, recombinant DNA is directly injected\n\ninto the nucleus of an animal cell. In another method, suitable for plants,\n\ncells are bombarded with high velocity micro-particles of gold or tungsten\n\ncoated with DNA in a method known as biolistics or gene gun. And the\n\nlast method uses ‘disarmed pathogen’ vectors, which when allowed to\n\ninfect the cell, transfer the recombinant DNA into the host.\n\nNow that we have learnt about the tools for constructing recombinant\n\nDNA, let us discuss the processes facilitating recombinant DNA technology.\n\n11.3 PROCESSES OF RECOMBINANT DNA TECHNOLOGY\n\nRecombinant DNA technology involves several steps in specific\n\nsequence such as isolation of DNA, fragmentation of DNA by\n\nrestriction endonucleases, isolation of a desired DNA fragment,\n\nligation of the DNA fragment into a vector, transferring the\n\nrecombinant DNA into the host, culturing the host cells in a\n\nmedium at large scale and extraction of the desired product.\n\nLet us examine each of these steps in some details.\n\n11.3.1 Isolation of the Genetic Material (DNA)\n\nRecall that nucleic acid is the genetic material of all organisms\n\nwithout exception. In majority of organisms this is\n\ndeoxyribonucleic acid or DNA. In order to cut the DNA with\n\nrestriction enzymes, it needs to be in pure form, free from other\n\nmacro-molecules. Since the DNA is enclosed within the\n\nmembranes, we have to break the cell open to release DNA along\n\nwith other macromolecules such as RNA, proteins,\n\npolysaccharides and also lipids. This can be achieved by treating\n\nthe bacterial cells/plant or animal tissue with enzymes such as\n\nlysozyme (bacteria), cellulase (plant cells), chitinase (fungus).\n\nYou know that genes are located on long molecules of DNA\n\ninterwined with proteins such as histones. The RNA can be removed by\n\ntreatment with ribonuclease whereas proteins can be removed by\n\ntreatment with protease. Other molecules can be removed by appropriate\n\ntreatments and purified DNA ultimately precipitates out after the addition\n\nof chilled ethanol. This can be seen as collection of fine threads in the\n\nsuspension (Figure 11.5).\n\nFigure 11.5 DNA that\nseparates out can be\nremoved by spooling\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n202\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n11.3.2 Cutting of DNA at Specific Locations\n\nRestriction enzyme digestions are performed by incubating purified DNA\n\nmolecules with the restriction enzyme, at the optimal conditions for that\n\nspecific enzyme. Agarose gel electrophoresis is employed to check the\n\nprogression of a restriction enzyme digestion. DNA is a negatively charged\n\nmolecule, hence it moves towards the positive electrode (anode)\n\n(Figure 11.3).  The process is repeated with the vector DNA also.\n\nThe joining of DNA involves several processes. After having cut the\n\nsource DNA as well as the vector DNA with a specific restriction enzyme,\n\nthe cut out ‘gene of interest’ from the source DNA and the cut vector with\n\nspace are mixed and ligase is added. This results in the preparation of\n\nrecombinant DNA.\n\n11.3.3 Amplification of Gene of Interest using PCR\n\nPCR stands for Polymerase Chain Reaction. In this reaction, multiple\n\ncopies of the gene (or DNA) of interest is synthesised in vitro using two\n\nFigure 11.6 Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) : Each cycle has three steps: (i) Denaturation;\n(ii) Primer annealing; and (iii) Extension of primers\n\n202\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n BIOTECHNOLOGY : PRINCIPLES AND PROCESSES\n\n203\n\nsets of primers (small chemically synthesised oligonucleotides that are\n\ncomplementary to the regions of DNA) and the enzyme DNA polymerase.\n\nThe enzyme extends the primers using the nucleotides provided in the\n\nreaction and the genomic DNA as template. If the process of replication\n\nof DNA is repeated many times, the segment of DNA can be amplified\n\nto approximately billion times, i.e., 1 billion copies are made.  Such\n\nrepeated amplification is achieved by the use of a thermostable DNA\n\npolymerase (isolated from a bacterium, Thermus aquaticus), which\n\nremain active during the high temperature induced denaturation of\n\ndouble stranded DNA.  The amplified fragment  if desired can now be\n\nused to ligate with a vector for further cloning (Figure11.6).\n\n11.3.4 Insertion of Recombinant DNA into the Host\nCell/Organism\n\nThere are several methods of introducing the ligated DNA into recipient\n\ncells. Recipient cells after making them ‘competent’ to receive, take up\n\nDNA present in its surrounding. So, if a recombinant DNA bearing gene\n\nfor resistance to an antibiotic (e.g., ampicillin) is transferred into  E. coli\n\ncells, the host cells become transformed into ampicillin-resistant cells. If\n\nwe spread the transformed cells on agar plates containing ampicillin, only\n\ntransformants will grow, untransformed recipient cells will die. Since, due\n\nto ampicillin resistance gene, one is able to select a transformed cell in the\n\npresence of ampicillin. The ampicillin resistance gene in this case is called\n\na selectable marker.\n\n11.3.5 Obtaining the Foreign Gene Product\n\nWhen you insert a piece of alien DNA into a cloning vector and transfer it\n\ninto a bacterial, plant or animal cell, the alien DNA gets multiplied. In\n\nalmost all recombinant technologies, the ultimate aim is to produce a\n\ndesirable protein. Hence, there is a need for the recombinant DNA to be\n\nexpressed. The foreign gene gets expressed under appropriate conditions.\n\nThe expression of foreign genes in host cells involve understanding many\n\ntechnical details.\n\nAfter having cloned the gene of interest and having optimised the\n\nconditions to induce the expression of the target protein, one has to\n\nconsider producing it on a large scale. Can you think of any reason\n\nwhy there is a need for large-scale production? If any protein encoding\n\ngene is expressed in a heterologous host, it is called a recombinant\n\nprotein. The cells harbouring cloned genes of interest may be grown\n\non a small scale in the laboratory. The cultures may be used for\n\nextracting the desired protein and then purifying it by using different\n\nseparation techniques.\n\nThe cells can also be multiplied in a continuous culture system wherein\n\nthe used medium is drained out from one side while fresh medium is\n\nadded from the other to maintain the cells in their physiologically most\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n204\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nA stirred-tank reactor is usually cylindrical or with a curved base to\n\nfacilitate the mixing of the reactor contents. The stirrer facilitates even\n\nmixing and oxygen availability throughout the bioreactor. Alternatively\n\nair can be bubbled through the reactor. If you look at the figure closely\n\nyou will see that the bioreactor has an agitator system, an oxygen delivery\n\nsystem and a foam control system, a temperature control system, pH\n\ncontrol system and sampling ports so that small volumes of the culture\n\ncan be withdrawn periodically.\n\n11.3.6 Downstream Processing\n\nAfter completion of the biosynthetic stage, the product has to be subjected\n\nthrough a series of processes before it is  ready for marketing as a finished\n\nactive log/exponential phase. This type of culturing method produces a\n\nlarger biomass leading to  higher yields of desired protein.\n\nSmall volume cultures cannot yield appreciable quantities of products.\n\nTo produce in large quantities, the development of bioreactors, where\n\nlarge volumes (100-1000 litres) of culture can be processed, was required.\n\nThus, bioreactors can be thought of as vessels in which raw materials are\n\nbiologically converted into specific products,  individual enzymes, etc.,\n\nusing microbial plant, animal or human cells. A bioreactor provides the\n\noptimal conditions for achieving the desired product by providing\n\noptimum growth conditions (temperature, pH, substrate, salts, vitamins,\n\noxygen).\n\nThe most commonly used bioreactors are of stirring type, which are\n\nshown in Figure 11.7.\n\nFigure 11.7 (a) Simple stirred-tank bioreactor; (b) Sparged stirred-tank bioreactor through which\nsterile air bubbles are sparged\n\n(a) (b)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n BIOTECHNOLOGY : PRINCIPLES AND PROCESSES\n\n205\n\nSUMMARY\n\nBiotechnology deals with large scale production and marketing of\nproducts and processes using live organisms, cells or enzymes.\nModern biotechnology using genetically modified organisms was\nmade possible only when man learnt to alter the chemistry of DNA\nand construct recombinant DNA. This key process is called\nrecombinant DNA technology or genetic engineering. This process\ninvolves the use of restriction endonucleases, DNA ligase,\nappropriate plasmid or viral vectors to isolate and ferry the foreign\nDNA into host organisms, expression of the foreign gene, purification\nof the gene product, i.e., the functional protein and finally making a\nsuitable formulation for marketing. Large scale production involves\n\nuse of bioreactors.\n\nEXERCISES\n1. Can you list 10 recombinant proteins which are used in medical\n\npractice?

The processes include separation and purification, which are\n\ncollectively referred to as downstream processing.  The product has to be\n\nformulated with suitable preservatives.  Such formulation has to undergo\n\nthorough clinical trials as in case of drugs.  Strict quality control testing\n\nfor each product is also required.  The downstream processing and quality\n\ncontrol testing vary from product to product.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n206\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n10.

Three critical research areas of\n\nbiotechnology are:\n\n(i) Providing the best catalyst in the form of improved\n\norganism usually a microbe or pure enzyme.\n\n(ii) Creating optimal conditions through engineering for\n\na catalyst to act, and\n\n(iii) Downstream processing technologies to purify the\n\nprotein/organic compound.\n\nLet us now learn how human beings have used\n\nbiotechnology to improve the quality of human life,\n\nespecially in the field of food production and health.\n\n12.1 BIOTECHNOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS IN\nAGRICULTURE\n\nLet us take a look at the three options that can be thought\n\nfor increasing food production\n\n(i) agro-chemical based agriculture;\n\nCHAPTER 12\n\nBIOTECHNOLOGY AND ITS\n\nAPPLICATIONS\n\n12.1 Biotechnological\n\nApplications in\n\nAgriculture\n\n12.2 Biotechnological\n\nApplications in\n\nMedicine\n\n12.3 Transgenic Animals\n\n12.4 Ethical Issues\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n208\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n(ii) organic agriculture; and\n\n(iii) genetically engineered crop-based agriculture.\n\nThe Green Revolution succeeded in tripling the food supply but yet\n\nit was not enough to feed the growing human population. Increased yields\n\nhave partly been due to the use of improved crop varieties, but mainly\n\ndue to the use of better management practices and use of agrochemicals\n\n(fertilisers and pesticides). However, for farmers in the developing world,\n\nagrochemicals are often too expensive, and further increases in yield with\n\nexisting varieties are not possible using conventional breeding. Is there\n\nany alternative path that our understanding of genetics can show so that\n\nfarmers may obtain maximum yield from their fields? Is there a way to\n\nminimise the use of fertilisers and chemicals so that their harmful effects\n\non the environment are reduced? Use of genetically modified crops is a\n\npossible solution.\n\nPlants, bacteria, fungi and animals whose genes have been altered by\n\nmanipulation are called Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO). GM\n\nplants have been useful in many ways. Genetic modification has:\n\n(i) made crops more tolerant to abiotic stresses (cold, drought, salt, heat).\n\n(ii) reduced reliance on chemical pesticides (pest-resistant crops).\n\n(iii) helped to reduce post harvest losses.\n\n(iv) increased efficiency of mineral usage by plants (this prevents early\n\nexhaustion of fertility of soil).\n\n(v) enhanced nutritional value of food, e.g., golden rice, i.e., Vitamin ‘A’\n\nenriched rice.\n\nIn addition to these uses, GM has been used to create tailor-made\n\nplants to supply alternative resources to industries, in the form of starches,\n\nfuels and pharmaceuticals.\n\nSome of the applications of biotechnology in agriculture that you will\n\nstudy in detail are the production of pest resistant plants, which could\n\ndecrease the amount of pesticide used. Bt toxin is produced by a\n\nbacterium called Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt for short).  Bt toxin gene has\n\nbeen cloned from the bacteria and been expressed in plants to provide\n\nresistance to insects without the need for insecticides; in effect created a\n\nbio-pesticide. Examples are Bt cotton, Bt corn, rice, tomato, potato and\n\nsoyabean etc.\n\nBt Cotton: Some strains of Bacillus thuringiensis produce proteins that\n\nkill certain insects such as lepidopterans (tobacco budworm, armyworm),\n\ncoleopterans (beetles) and dipterans (flies, mosquitoes).  B. thuringiensis\n\nforms protein crystals during a particular phase of their growth. These\n\ncrystals contain a toxic insecticidal protein. Why does this toxin not kill\n\nthe Bacillus? Actually, the Bt toxin protein exist as inactive protoxins but\n\nonce an insect ingest the inactive toxin, it is converted into an active form\n\nof toxin due to the alkaline pH of the gut which solubilise the crystals.\n\nThe activated toxin binds to the surface of midgut epithelial cells and\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n209\n\nBIOTECHNOLOGY AND ITS APPLICATIONS\n\ncreate pores that cause cell swelling and lysis and eventually cause death\n\nof the insect.\n\nSpecific Bt toxin genes were isolated from Bacillus thuringiensis and\n\nincorporated into the several crop plants such as cotton (Figure 12.1).\n\nThe choice of genes depends upon the crop and the targeted pest, as\n\nmost Bt toxins are insect-group specific. The toxin is coded by a gene\n\ncryIAc  named cry. There are a number of them, for example, the proteins\n\nencoded by the genes cryIAc and cryIIAb control the cotton bollworms,\n\nthat of cryIAb controls corn borer.\n\nFigure 12.1 Cotton boll: (a) destroyed by bollworms; (b) a fully mature\ncotton boll\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\nPest Resistant Plants: Several nematodes parasitise a wide variety of\n\nplants and animals including human beings. A nematode Meloidegyne\n\nincognitia infects the roots of tobacco plants and causes a great reduction\n\nin yield. A novel strategy was adopted to prevent this infestation which\n\nwas based on the process of RNA interference (RNAi). RNAi takes place\n\nin all eukaryotic organisms as a method of cellular defense. This method\n\ninvolves silencing of a specific mRNA due to a complementary dsRNA\n\nmolecule that binds to and prevents translation of the mRNA (silencing).\n\nThe source of this  complementary RNA could be from an infection by\n\nviruses having RNA genomes or mobile genetic elements (transposons)\n\nthat replicate via an RNA intermediate.\n\nUsing Agrobacterium vectors, nematode-specific genes were\n\nintroduced into the host plant (Figure 12.2). The introduction of DNA\n\nwas such that it produced both sense and anti-sense RNA in the host\n\ncells. These two RNA’s being complementary to each other formed a double\n\nstranded (dsRNA) that initiated RNAi and thus, silenced the specific mRNA\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n210\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nof the nematode. The consequence was that the parasite could not survive\n\nin a transgenic host expressing specific interfering RNA. The transgenic\n\nplant therefore got itself protected from the parasite (Figure 12.2).\n\nFigure 12.2 Host plant-generated dsRNA triggers protection against nematode infestation:\n(a) Roots of a typical control plants; (b) transgenic plant roots 5 days after deliberate\ninfection of nematode but protected through novel mechanism.\n\n(a) (b)\n\n12.2 BIOTECHNOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS IN MEDICINE\n\nThe recombinant DNA technological processes have made immense impact\n\nin the area of healthcare by enabling mass production of safe and more\n\neffective therapeutic drugs. Further, the recombinant therapeutics do not\n\ninduce unwanted immunological responses as is common in case of\n\nsimilar products isolated from non-human sources. At present, about\n\n30 recombinant therapeutics have been approved for human-use the\n\nworld over. In India, 12 of these are presently being marketed.\n\n12.2.1 Genetically Engineered Insulin\n\nManagement of adult-onset diabetes is possible by taking insulin at\n\nregular time intervals. What would a diabetic patient do if enough\n\nhuman-insulin was not available? If you discuss this, you would soon\n\nrealise that one would have to isolate and use insulin from other animals.\n\nWould the insulin isolated from other animals be just as effective as\n\nthat secreted by the human body itself and would it not elicit an immune\n\nresponse in the human body? Now, imagine if bacterium were available\n\nthat could make human insulin. Suddenly the whole process becomes\n\nso simple. You can easily grow a large quantity of the bacteria and make\n\nas much insulin as you need.\n\nThink about whether insulin can be orally administered to diabetic\n\npeople or not. Why?\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n211\n\nBIOTECHNOLOGY AND ITS APPLICATIONS\n\nInsulin used for diabetes was earlier extracted from\n\npancreas of slaughtered cattle and pigs. Insulin from an\n\nanimal source, though caused some patients to develop\n\nallergy or other types of reactions to the foreign\n\nprotein. Insulin consists of two short polypeptide\n\nchains: chain A and chain B, that are linked together by\n\ndisulphide bridges (Figure 12.3). In mammals, including\n\nhumans, insulin is synthesised as a pro-hormone (like a\n\npro-enzyme, the pro-hormone also needs to be processed\n\nbefore it becomes a fully mature and functional hormone)\n\nwhich contains an extra stretch called the C peptide.\n\nThis C peptide is not present in the mature insulin and is\n\nremoved during maturation into insulin.The main\n\nchallenge for production of insulin using rDNA techniques\n\nwas getting insulin assembled into a mature form. In\n\n1983, Eli Lilly an American company prepared two DNA sequences\n\ncorresponding to A and B, chains of human insulin and introduced them\n\nin plasmids of E. coli to produce insulin chains. Chains A and B were\n\nproduced separately, extracted and combined by creating disulfide bonds\n\nto form human insulin.\n\n12.2.2 Gene Therapy\n\nIf a person is born with a hereditary disease, can a corrective therapy\n\nbe taken for such a disease? Gene therapy is an attempt to do this.\n\nGene therapy is a collection of methods that allows correction of a\n\ngene defect that has been diagnosed in a child/embryo. Here genes\n\nare inserted into a person’s cells and tissues to treat a disease.\n\nCorrection of a genetic defect involves delivery of a normal gene into\n\nthe individual or embryo to take over the function of and compensate\n\nfor the non-functional gene.\n\nThe first clinical gene therapy was given in 1990 to a 4-year old girl\n\nwith adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency. This enzyme is crucial for\n\nthe immune system to function. The disorder is caused due to the deletion\n\nof the gene for adenosine deaminase. In some children ADA deficiency\n\ncan be cured by bone marrow transplantation; in others it can be treated\n\nby enzyme replacement therapy, in which functional ADA is given to the\n\npatient by injection. But the problem with both of these approaches that\n\nthey are not completely curative. As a first step towards gene therapy,\n\nlymphocytes from the blood of the patient are grown in a culture outside\n\nthe body. A functional ADA cDNA (using a retroviral vector) is then\n\nintroduced into these lymphocytes, which are  subsequently returned to\n\nthe patient. However, as these cells are not immortal, the patient requires\n\nperiodic infusion of such genetically engineered lymphocytes. However, if\n\nthe gene isolate from marrow cells producing ADA is introduced into cells\n\nat early embryonic stages, it could be a permanent cure.\n\nFigure 12.3 Maturation of\npro-insulin into insulin\n(simplified)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n212\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n12.2.3 Molecular Diagnosis\n\nYou know that for effective treatment of a disease, early diagnosis and\n\nunderstanding its pathophysiology is very important.  Using conventional\n\nmethods of diagnosis (serum and urine analysis, etc.) early detection is\n\nnot possible. Recombinant DNA technology, Polymerase Chain Reaction\n\n(PCR) and Enzyme Linked Immuno-sorbent Assay (ELISA) are some of\n\nthe techniques that serve the purpose of early diagnosis.\n\nPresence of a pathogen (bacteria, viruses, etc.) is normally suspected\n\nonly when the pathogen has produced a disease symptom. By this time\n\nthe concentration of pathogen is already very high in the body. However,\n\nvery low concentration of a bacteria or virus (at a time when the symptoms\n\nof the disease are not yet visible) can be detected by amplification of their\n\nnucleic acid by PCR. Can you explain how PCR can detect very low\n\namounts of DNA? PCR is now routinely used to detect HIV in suspected\n\nAIDS patients. It is being used to detect mutations in genes in suspected\n\ncancer patients too. It is a powerful techqnique to identify many other\n\ngenetic disorders.\n\nA single stranded DNA or RNA, tagged with a radioactive molecule\n\n(probe) is allowed to hybridise to its complementary DNA in a clone of\n\ncells followed by detection using autoradiography. The clone having the\n\nmutated gene will hence not appear on the photographic film, because\n\nthe probe will not have complementarity with the mutated gene.\n\nELISA is based on the principle of antigen-antibody interaction.\n\nInfection by pathogen can be detected by the presence of antigens\n\n(proteins, glycoproteins, etc.) or by detecting the antibodies synthesised\n\nagainst the pathogen.\n\n12.3 TRANSGENIC ANIMALS\n\nAnimals that have had their DNA manipulated to possess and express an\n\nextra (foreign) gene are known as transgenic animals. Transgenic rats,\n\nrabbits, pigs, sheep, cows and fish have been produced, although over\n\n95 per cent of all existing transgenic animals are mice. Why are these\n\nanimals being produced? How can man benefit from such modifications?\n\nLet us try and explore some of the common reasons:\n\n(i) Normal physiology and development: Transgenic animals can\n\nbe specifically designed to allow the study of how genes are\n\nregulated, and how they affect the normal functions of the body\n\nand its development, e.g., study of complex factors involved in growth\n\nsuch as insulin-like growth factor. By introducing genes from other\n\nspecies that alter the formation of this factor and studying the\n\nbiological effects that result, information is obtained about the\n\nbiological role of the factor in the body.\n\n(ii) Study of disease: Many transgenic animals are designed to increase\n\nour understanding of how genes contribute to the development of\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n213\n\nBIOTECHNOLOGY AND ITS APPLICATIONS\n\ndisease. These are specially made to serve as models for human\n\ndiseases so that investigation of new treatments for diseases is made\n\npossible. Today transgenic models exist for many human diseases\n\nsuch as cancer, cystic fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis and Alzheimer’s.\n\n(iii) Biological products: Medicines required to treat certain human\n\ndiseases can contain biological products, but such products are\n\noften expensive to make. Transgenic animals that produce useful\n\nbiological products can be created by the introduction of the portion\n\nof DNA (or genes) which codes for a particular product such as\n\nhuman protein (α-1-antitrypsin) used to treat emphysema. Similar\n\nattempts are being made for treatment of phenylketonuria (PKU)\n\nand cystic fibrosis. In 1997, the first transgenic cow, Rosie, produced\n\nhuman protein-enriched milk (2.4 grams per litre). The milk\n\ncontained the human alpha-lactalbumin and was nutritionally a\n\nmore balanced product for human babies than natural cow-milk.\n\n(iv) Vaccine safety: Transgenic mice are being developed for use in\n\ntesting the safety of vaccines before they are used on humans.\n\nTransgenic mice are being used to test the safety of the polio vaccine.\n\nIf successful and found to be reliable, they could replace the use of\n\nmonkeys to test the safety of batches of the vaccine.\n\n(v) Chemical safety testing: This is known as toxicity/safety testing.\n\nThe procedure is the same as that used for testing toxicity of drugs.\n\nTransgenic animals are made that carry genes which make them more\n\nsensitive to toxic substances than non-transgenic animals. They are\n\nthen exposed to the toxic substances and the effects studied. Toxicity\n\ntesting in such animals will allow us to obtain results in less time.\n\n12.4 ETHICAL ISSUES\n\nThe manipulation of living organisms by the human race cannot go on\n\nany further, without regulation. Some ethical standards are required to\n\nevaluate the morality of all human activities that might help or harm living\n\norganisms.\n\nGoing beyond the morality of such issues, the biological significance\n\nof such things is also important. Genetic modification of organisms can\n\nhave unpredicatable results when such organisms are introduced into\n\nthe ecosystem.\n\nTherefore, the Indian Government has set up organisations such as\n\nGEAC (Genetic Engineering Approval Committee), which will make\n\ndecisions regarding the validity of GM research and the safety of\n\nintroducing GM-organisms for public services.\n\nThe modification/usage of living organisms for public services (as food\n\nand medicine sources, for example) has also created problems with patents\n\ngranted for the same.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n214\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nThere is growing public anger that certain companies are being\n\ngranted patents for products and technologies that make use of the\n\ngenetic materials, plants and other biological resources that have long\n\nbeen identified, developed and used by farmers and indigenous people\n\nof a specific region/country.\n\nRice is an important food grain, the presence of which goes back\n\nthousands of years in Asia’s agricultural history. There are an estimated\n\n200,000 varieties of rice in India alone. The diversity of rice in India is\n\none of the richest in the world. Basmati rice is distinct for its unique\n\naroma and flavour and 27 documented varieties of Basmati are grown\n\nin India. There is reference to Basmati in ancient texts, folklore and\n\npoetry, as it has been grown for centuries. In 1997, an American\n\ncompany got patent rights on Basmati rice through the US Patent and\n\nTrademark Office. This allowed the company to sell a ‘new’ variety of\n\nBasmati, in the US and abroad. This ‘new’ variety of Basmati had actually\n\nbeen derived from Indian farmer’s varieties. Indian Basmati was crossed\n\nwith semi-dwarf varieties and claimed as an invention or a novelty. The\n\npatent extends to functional equivalents, implying that other people\n\nselling Basmati rice could be restricted by the patent. Several attempts\n\nhave also been made to patent uses, products and processes based on\n\nIndian traditional herbal medicines, e.g., turmeric neem. If we are not\n\nvigilant and we do not immediately counter these patent applications,\n\nother countries/individuals may encash on our rich legacy and we may\n\nnot be able to do anything about it.\n\nBiopiracy is the term used to refer to the use of bio-resources by\n\nmultinational companies and other organisations without proper\n\nauthorisation from the countries and people concerned without\n\ncompensatory payment.\n\nMost of the industrialised nations are rich financially but poor in\n\nbiodiversity and traditional knowledge. In contrast the developing and\n\nthe underdeveloped world is rich in biodiversity and traditional\n\nknowledge related to bio-resources.  Traditional knowledge related to\n\nbio-resources can be exploited to develop modern applications and can\n\nalso be used to save time, effort and expenditure during their\n\ncommercialisation.\n\nThere has been growing realisation of the injustice, inadequate\n\ncompensation and benefit sharing between developed and developing\n\ncountries. Therefore, some nations are developing laws to prevent such\n\nunauthorised exploitation of their bio-resources and traditional\n\nknowledge.\n\nThe Indian Parliament has recently cleared the second amendment\n\nof the Indian Patents Bill, that takes such issues into consideration,\n\nincluding patent terms emergency provisions and research and\n\ndevelopment initiative.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n215\n\nBIOTECHNOLOGY AND ITS APPLICATIONS\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1.

Compare and contrast the advantages and disadvantages of production\nof genetically modified crops.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nBiotechnology has given to humans several useful products by using\nmicrobes, plant, animals and their metabolic machinery. Recombinant\nDNA technology has made it possible to engineer microbes, plants\nand animals such that they have novel capabilities. Genetically\nModified Organisms have been created by using methods other than\nnatural methods to transfer one or more genes from one organism to\nanother, generally using techniques such as recombinant DNA\ntechnology.\n\nGM plants have been useful in increasing crop yields, reduce post-\nharvest losses and make crops more tolerant of stresses. There are\nseveral GM crop plants with improved nutritional value of foods and\nreduced the reliance on chemical pesticides (pest-resistant crops).\n\nRecombinant DNA technological processes have made immense\nimpact in the area of healthcare by enabling mass production of safe\nand more effective therapeutics. Since the recombinant therapeutics\nare identical to human proteins, they do not induce unwanted\nimmunological responses and are free from risk of infection as was\nobserved in case of similar products isolated from non-human sources.\nHuman insulin is made in bacteria yet its structure is absolutely\nidentical to that of the natural molecule.\n\nTransgenic animals are also used to understand how genes\ncontribute to the development of a disease by serving as models for\nhuman diseases, such as cancer, cystic fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis\nand Alzheimer’s.\n\nGene therapy is the insertion of genes into an individual’s cells\nand tissues to treat diseases especially hereditary diseases. It does\nso by replacing a defective mutant allele with a functional one or\ngene targeting which involves gene amplification. Viruses that attack\ntheir hosts and introduce their genetic material into the host cell as\npart of their replication cycle are used as vectors to transfer healthy\ngenes or more recently portions of genes.\n\nThe current interest in the manipulation of microbes, plants, and\nanimals has raised serious ethical questions.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n216\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n4.

Biology is presented either\n\nas botany, zoology and microbiology or as classical and\n\nmodern. The latter is a euphemism for molecular aspects of\n\nbiology. Luckily we have many threads which weave the\n\ndifferent areas of biological information into a unifying\n\nprinciple. Ecology is one such thread which gives us a holistic\n\nperspective to biology. The essence of biological understanding\n\nis to know how organisms, while remaining an individual,\n\ninteract with other organisms and physical habitats as a group\n\nand hence behave like organised wholes, i.e., population,\n\ncommunity, ecosystem or even as the whole biosphere.\n\nEcology explains to us all this. A particular aspect of this is the\n\nstudy of anthropogenic environmental degradation and the\n\nsocio-political issues it has raised. This unit describes as well as\n\ntakes a critical view of the above aspects.\n\nChapter 13\n\nOrganisms and Populations\n\nChapter 14\n\nEcosystem\n\nChapter 15\n\nBiodiversity and Conservation\n\nChapter 16\n\nEnvironmental  Issues\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nRamdeo Misra is revered as the Father of Ecology in India. Born on 26 August\n\n1908,  Ramdeo Misra obtained Ph.D in Ecology (1937) under Prof. W. H. Pearsall,\n\nFRS, from Leeds University in UK. He established  teaching and research  in\n\necology at the Department of Botany of the Banaras Hindu University,\n\nVaranasi. His research laid the foundations for understanding of tropical\n\ncommunities and their succession, environmental responses of plant\n\npopulations and productivity and nutrient cycling in tropical forest and\n\ngrassland ecosystems. Misra formulated the first postgraduate course in\n\necology in India. Over 50 scholars obtained Ph. D degree under his supervision\n\nand moved on to other universities and research institutes to initiate ecology\n\nteaching and research across the country.\n\nHe was honoured with the Fellowships of the Indian National Science\n\nAcademy and World Academy of Arts and Science, and the prestigious Sanjay\n\nGandhi Award in Environment and Ecology. Due to his efforts, the\n\nGovernment of India established the National Committee for Environmental\n\nPlanning and Coordination (1972) which, in later years, paved the way\n\nfor the establishment of the Ministry of Environment and Forests (1984).\n\nRAMDEO MISRA\n(1908-1998)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nOur living world is fascinatingly diverse and amazingly\n\ncomplex.  We can try to understand its complexity by\n\ninvestigating processes at various levels of biological\n\norganisation–macromolecules, cells, tissues, organs,\n\nindividual organisms, population, communities,\n\necosystems and biomes. At any level of biological\n\norganisation we can ask two types of questions – for\n\nexample, when we hear the bulbul singing early morning\n\nin the garden, we may ask – ‘How does the bird sing?’\n\nOr, ‘Why does the bird sing ?’  The ‘how-type’ questions\n\nseek the mechanism behind the process while the ‘why-\n\ntype’ questions seek the significance of the process. For\n\nthe first question in our example, the answer might be in\n\nterms of the operation of the voice box and the vibrating\n\nbone in the bird, whereas for the second question the\n\nanswer may lie in the bird’s need to communicate with its\n\nmate during breeding season. When you observe nature\n\naround you with a scientific frame of mind you will\n\ncertainly come up with many interesting questions of both\n\ntypes - Why are night-blooming flowers generally white?\n\nHow does the bee know which flower has nectar? Why\n\ndoes cactus have so many thorns? How does the chick\n\nspures recognise her own mother?, and so on.\n\nCHAPTER 13\n\nORGANISMS AND POPULATIONS\n\n13.1 Organism and Its\n\nEnvironment\n\n13.2 Populations\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n220\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nYou have already learnt in previous classes that Ecology is a subject\n\nwhich studies the interactions among organisms and between the\n\norganism and its physical (abiotic) environment.\n\nEcology is basically concerned with four levels of biological\n\norganisation – organisms, populations, communities and biomes.  In this\n\nchapter we explore ecology at organismic and population levels.\n\n13.1 ORGANISM AND ITS ENVIRONMENT\n\nEcology at the organismic level is essentially physiological ecology which\n\ntries to understand how different organisms are adapted to their\n\nenvironments in terms of not only survival but also reproduction.  You\n\nmay have learnt in earlier classes how the rotation of  our planet around\n\nthe Sun and the tilt of its axis cause annual variations in the intensity\n\nand duration of temperature, resulting in distinct seasons.  These\n\nvariations together with annual variation in precipitation (remember\n\nprecipitation includes both rain and snow) account for the formation of\n\nmajor biomes such as desert, rain forest and tundra (Figure 13.1).\n\nFigure 13.1 Biome distribution with respect to annual temperature and precipitation\n\nRegional and local variations within each biome lead to the formation of a\n\nwide variety of habitats. Major biomes of India are shown in Figure 13.2.\n\nOn planet Earth, life exists not just in a few favourable habitats but even\n\nin extreme and harsh habitats – scorching Rajasthan desert, rain-soaked\n\nMeghalaya forests, deep ocean trenches, torrential streams, permafrost\n\n(snow laden) polar regions, high mountain tops, thermal springs, and\n\nstinking compost pits, to name a few.  Even our intestine is a unique\n\nhabitat for hundreds of species of microbes.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n221\n\nORGANISMS AND POPULATIONS\n\nWhat are the key elements that lead to so much variation in the\n\nphysical and chemical conditions of different habitats? The most\n\nimportant ones are temperature, water, light and soil.  We must remember\n\nthat the physico-chemical (abiotic) components alone do not characterise\n\nthe habitat of an organism completely; the habitat includes biotic\n\ncomponents also – pathogens, parasites, predators and competitors – of\n\nthe organism with which they interact constantly.  We assume that over a\n\nperiod of time, the organism had through natural selection, evolved\n\nadaptations to optimise its survival and reproduction in its habitat.\n\nEach organism has an invariably defined range of conditions that it\ncan tolerate, diversity in the resources it utilises and a distinct functional\nrole in the ecological system, all these together comprise its niche.\n\n13.1.1 Major Abiotic Factors\n\nTemperature: Temperature is the most important ecologically relevant\n\nenvironmental factor.  You are aware that the average temperature on\n\nland varies seasonally, decreases progressively from the equator towards\n\nthe poles and from plains to the mountain tops. It ranges from subzero\n\nlevels in polar areas and high altitudes to >500C in tropical deserts in\n\nsummer. There are, however, unique habitats such as thermal springs\n\nand deep-sea hydrothermal vents where average temperatures exceed\n\n1000 C.  It is general knowledge that mango trees do not and cannot grow\n\nFigure 13.2 Major biomes of India : (a) Tropical rain forest; (b) Deciduous forest;\n(c) Desert; (d) Sea coast\n\n (a)  (b)\n\n (c)  (d)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n222\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nin temperate countries like Canada and Germany, snow leopards are not\n\nfound in Kerala forests and tuna fish are rarely caught beyond tropical\n\nlatitudes in the ocean. You can appreciate the significance of temperature\n\nto living organisms when you realise that it affects the kinetics of enzymes\n\nand through it the metabolic activity and other physiological functions of\n\nthe organism. A few organisms can tolerate and thrive in a wide range of\n\ntemperatures (they are called eurythermal ), but, a vast majority of them\n\nare restricted to a narrow range of temperatures (such organisms are called\n\nstenothermal ). The levels of thermal tolerance of different species determine\n\nto a large extent their geographical distribution. Can you think of a few\n\neurythermal and stenothermal animals and plants?\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing concern about the gradually\n\nincreasing average global temperatures (Chapter 16). If this trend continues,\n\nwould you expect the distributional range of some species to be affected?\n\nWater: Water is another the most important factor influencing the life of\n\norganisms. In fact, life on earth originated in water and is unsustainable\n\nwithout water. Its availability is so limited in deserts that only special\n\nadaptations make it possible for organisms to live there. The productivity\n\nand distribution of plants is also heavily dependent on water.  You might\n\nthink that organisms living in oceans, lakes and rivers should not face\n\nany water-related problems, but it is not true.  For aquatic organisms the\n\nquality (chemical composition, pH) of water becomes important. The salt\n\nconcentration (measured as salinity in parts per thousand), is less than\n\n5 in inland waters, 30-35 in the sea and > 100 in some hypersaline\n\nlagoons. Some organisms are tolerant of a wide range of salinities\n\n(euryhaline) but others are restricted to a narrow range (stenohaline).\n\nMany freshwater animals cannot live for long in sea water and vice versa\n\nbecause of the osmotic problems, they would face.\n\nLight: Since plants produce food through photosynthesis, a process which\n\nis only possible when sunlight is available as a source of energy, we can\n\nquickly understand the importance of light for living organisms,\n\nparticularly autotrophs.  Many species of small plants (herbs and shrubs)\n\ngrowing in forests are adapted to photosynthesise optimally under very\n\nlow light conditions because they are constantly overshadowed by tall,\n\ncanopied trees. Many plants are also dependent on sunlight to meet their\n\nphotoperiodic requirement for flowering. For many animals too, light is\n\nimportant in that they use the diurnal and seasonal variations in light\n\nintensity and duration (photoperiod) as cues for timing their foraging,\n\nreproductive and migratory activities. The availability of light on land is\n\nclosely linked with that of temperature since the sun is the source for both.\n\nBut, deep (>500m) in the oceans, the environment is  dark and its inhabitants\n\nare not aware of the existence of a celestial source of energy called Sun.\n\nWhat, then is their source of energy?.  The spectral quality of solar radiation\n\nis also important for life.  The UV component of the spectrum is harmful to\n\nmany organisms while not all the colour components of the visible spectrum\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n223\n\nORGANISMS AND POPULATIONS\n\nare available for marine plants living at different depths of the ocean. Among\n\nthe red, green and brown algae that inhabit the sea, which is likely to\n\nbe found in the deepest waters? Why?\n\nSoil: The nature and properties of soil in different places vary; it is\n\ndependent on the climate, the weathering process, whether soil is\n\ntransported or sedimentary and how soil development occurred. Various\n\ncharacteristics of the soil such as soil composition, grain size and\n\naggregation determine the percolation and water holding capacity of the\n\nsoils. These characteristics along with parameters such as pH, mineral\n\ncomposition and topography determine to a large extent the vegetation in\n\nany area. This in turn dictates the type of animals that can be supported.\n\nSimilarly, in the aquatic environment, the sediment-characteristics often\n\ndetermine the type of benthic animals that can thrive there.\n\n13.1.2 Responses to Abiotic Factors\n\nHaving realised that the abiotic conditions of many habitats may vary\n\ndrastically in time, we now ask–how do the organisms living in such\n\nhabitats cope or manage with stressful conditions? But before attempting\n\nto answer this question, we should perhaps ask first why a highly variable\n\nexternal environment should bother organisms after all.  One would expect\n\nthat during the course of millions of years of their existence, many species\n\nwould have evolved a relatively constant internal (within the body)\n\nenvironment that permits all biochemical reactions and physiological\n\nfunctions to proceed with maximal efficiency\n\nand thus, enhance the overall ‘fitness’ of the\n\nspecies.  This constancy, for example, could\n\nbe in terms of optimal temperature and\n\nosmotic concentration of body fluids. Ideally\n\nthen, the organism should try to maintain\n\nthe constancy of its internal environment (a\n\nprocess called homeostasis) despite varying\n\nexternal environmental conditions that tend\n\nto upset its homeostasis.  Let us take an\n\nanalogy to clarify this important concept.\n\nSuppose a person is able to perform his/her\n\nbest when the temperature is 250C and\n\nwishes to maintain it so, even when it is\n\nscorchingly hot or freezingly cold outside. It\n\ncould be achieved at home, in the car while\n\ntravelling, and at workplace by using an air conditioner in summer and\n\nheater in winter. Then his/her performance would be always maximal\n\nregardless of the weather around him/her. Here the person’s homeostasis\n\nis accomplished, not through physiological, but artificial means. How do\n\nother living organisms cope with the situation? Let us look at various\n\npossibilities (Figure 13.3).\n\nFigure 13.3 Diagrammatic representation of\norganismic response\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n224\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n(i) Regulate: Some organisms are able to maintain homeostasis by\n\nphysiological (sometimes behavioural also) means which ensures\n\nconstant body temperature, constant osmotic concentration, etc.\n\nAll birds and mammals, and a very few lower vertebrate and\n\ninvertebrate species are indeed capable of such regulation\n\n(thermoregulation and osmoregulation).  Evolutionary biologists\n\nbelieve that the ‘success’ of mammals is largely due to their ability\n\nto maintain a constant body temperature and thrive whether they\n\nlive in Antarctica or in the Sahara desert.\n\nThe mechanisms used by most mammals to regulate their body\n\ntemperature are similar to the ones that we humans use. We maintain\n\na constant body temperature of 370C. In summer, when outside\n\ntemperature is more than our body temperature, we sweat profusely.\n\nThe resulting evaporative cooling, similar to what happens with a\n\ndesert cooler in operation, brings down the body temperature. In\n\nwinter when the temperature is much lower than 370C, we start to\n\nshiver, a kind of exercise which produces heat and raises the body\n\ntemperature.  Plants, on the other hand, do not have such\n\nmechanisms to maintain internal temperatures.\n\n(ii) Conform: An overwhelming majority (99 per cent) of animals and\n\nnearly all plants cannot maintain a constant internal environment.\n\nTheir body temperature changes with the ambient temperature. In\n\naquatic animals, the osmotic concentration of the body fluids\n\nchange with that of the ambient air, water osmotic concentration.\n\nThese animals and plants are simply conformers. Considering the\n\nbenefits of a constant internal environment to the organism, we must\n\nask why these conformers had not evolved to become regulators.\n\nRecall the human analogy we used above; much as they like, how\n\nmany people can really afford an air conditioner? Many simply\n\n‘sweat it out’ and resign themselves to suboptimal performance in\n\nhot summer months. Thermoregulation is energetically expensive\n\nfor many organisms. This is particularly true for small animals like\n\nshrews and humming birds.  Heat loss or heat gain is a function of\n\nsurface area. Since small animals have a larger surface area relative\n\nto their volume, they tend to lose body heat very fast when it is cold\n\noutside; then they have to expend much energy to generate body\n\nheat through metabolism. This is the main reason why very small\n\nanimals are rarely found in polar regions. During the course of\n\nevolution, the costs and benefits of maintaining a constant internal\n\nenvironment are taken into consideration. Some species have evolved\n\nthe ability to regulate, but only over a limited range of environmental\n\nconditions, beyond which they simply conform.\n\nIf the stressful external conditions are localised or remain only\n\nfor a short duration, the organism has two other alternatives for\n\nsurvival.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n225\n\nORGANISMS AND POPULATIONS\n\n(iii) Migrate : The organism can move away temporarily from the\n\nstressful habitat to a more hospitable area and return when stressful\n\nperiod is over. In human analogy, this strategy is like a person\n\nmoving from Delhi to Shimla for the duration of summer. Many\n\nanimals, particularly birds, during winter undertake long-distance\n\nmigrations to more hospitable areas. Every winter the famous\n\nKeolado National Park (Bharatpur) in Rajasthan host thousands of\n\nmigratory birds coming from Siberia and other extremely cold\n\nnorthern regions.\n\n(iv) Suspend: In bacteria, fungi and lower plants, various kinds of thick-\n\nwalled spores are formed which help them to survive unfavourable\n\nconditions – these germinate on availability of suitable environment.\n\nIn higher plants, seeds and some other vegetative reproductive\n\nstructures serve as means to tide over periods of stress besides helping\n\nin dispersal – they germinate to form new plants under favourable\n\nmoisture and temperature conditions. They do so by reducing their\n\nmetabolic activity and going into a state of ‘dormancy’.\n\nIn animals, the organism, if unable to migrate, might avoid the\n\nstress by escaping in time. The familiar case of bears going into\n\nhibernation during winter is an example of escape in time. Some\n\nsnails and fish go into aestivation to avoid summer–related\n\nproblems-heat and dessication. Under unfavourable conditions\n\nmany zooplankton species in lakes and ponds are known to enter\n\ndiapause, a stage of suspended development.\n\n13.1.3 Adaptations\n\nWhile considering the various alternatives available to organisms for\n\ncoping with extremes in their environment, we have seen that some are\n\nable to respond through certain physiological adjustments while others\n\ndo so behaviourally (migrating temporarily to a less stressful habitat).\n\nThese responses are also actually, their adaptations. So, we can say that\n\nadaptation is any attribute of the organism (morphological, physiological,\n\nbehavioural) that enables the organism to survive and reproduce in its\n\nhabitat. Many adaptations have evolved over a long evolutionary time\n\nand are genetically fixed. In the absence of an external source of water,\n\nthe kangaroo rat in North American deserts is capable of meeting all its\n\nwater requirements through its internal fat oxidation (in which water is\n\na by product).  It also has the ability to concentrate its urine so that\n\nminimal volume of water is used to remove excretory products.\n\nMany desert plants have a thick cuticle on their leaf surfaces and\n\nhave their stomata arranged in deep pits (sunken) to minimise water loss\n\nthrough transpiration.  They also have a special photosynthetic pathway\n\n(CAM) that enables their stomata to remain closed during day time.  Some\n\ndesert plants like Opuntia, have no leaves – they are reduced to spines–\n\nand the photosynthetic function is taken over by the flattened stems.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n226\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nMammals from colder climates generally have shorter ears and limbs\n\nto minimise heat loss. (This is called the Allen’s Rule.)  In the polar seas\n\naquatic mammals like seals have a thick layer of fat (blubber) below their\n\nskin that acts as an insulator and reduces loss of body heat.\n\nSome organisms possess adaptations that are physiological which\n\nallow them to respond quickly to a stressful situation.  If you had ever\n\nbeen to any high altitude place (>3,500m Rohtang Pass near Manali and\n\nLeh you must have experienced what is called altitude sickness.  Its\n\nsymptoms include nausea, fatigue and heart palpitations. This is because\n\nin the low atmospheric pressure of high altitudes, the body does not get\n\nenough oxygen. But, gradually you get acclimatised and stop experiencing\n\naltitude sickness. How did your body solve this problem? The body\n\ncompensates low oxygen availability by increasing red blood cell\n\nproduction, decreasing the binding affinity of hemoglobin and by\n\nincreasing breathing rate. Many tribes live in the high altitude of\n\nHimalayas. Find out if they normally have a higher red blood cell count\n\n(or total hemoglobin) than people living in the plains.\n\nIn most animals, the metabolic reactions and hence all the\n\nphysiological functions proceed optimally in a narrow temperature range\n\n(in humans, it is 370C). But there are microbes (archaebacteria) that\n\nflourish in hot springs and deep sea hydrothermal vents where\n\ntemperatures far exceed 1000C. How is this possible?\n\nMany fish thrive in Antarctic waters where the temperature is always\n\nbelow zero. How do they manage to prevent their body fluids from freezing?\n\nA large variety of marine invertebrates and fish live at great depths in\n\nthe ocean where the pressure could be >100 times the normal atmospheric\n\npressure that we experience. How do they live under such high  pressures\n\nand do they have any special enzymes? Organisms living in such extreme\n\nenvironments show a fascinating array of biochemical adaptations.\n\nSome organisms show behavioural responses to cope up with\n\nvariations in their environment. Desert lizards lack the physiological ability\n\nthat mammals have to deal with the high temperatures of their habitat,\n\nbut manage to keep their body temperature fairly constant by behavioural\n\nmeans.  They bask in the sun and absorb heat when their body\n\ntemperature drops below the comfort zone, but move into shade when\n\nthe ambient temperature starts increasing. Some species are capable of\n\nburrowing into the soil to hide and escape from the above-ground heat.\n\n13.2 POPULATIONS\n\n13.2.1 Population Attributes\n\nIn nature, we rarely find isolated, single individuals of any species; majority\n\nof them live in groups in a well defined geographical area, share or compete\n\nfor similar resources, potentially interbreed and thus constitute a\n\npopulation. Although the term interbreeding implies sexual reproduction,\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n227\n\nORGANISMS AND POPULATIONS\n\na group of individuals resulting from even asexual reproduction is also\n\ngenerally considered a population for the purpose of ecological studies.\n\nAll the cormorants in a wetland, rats in an abandoned dwelling, teakwood\n\ntrees in a forest tract, bacteria in a culture plate and lotus plants in a\n\npond, are some examples of a population.  In earlier chapters you have\n\nlearnt that although an individual organism is the one that has to cope\n\nwith a changed environment, it is at the population level that natural\n\nselection operates to evolve the desired traits. Population ecology is,\n\ntherefore, an important area  because it links ecology to population genetics\n\nand evolution.\n\nA population has certain attributes whereas, an individual organism\n\ndoes not. An individual may have births and deaths, but a population has\n\nbirth rates and death rates. In a population these rates refer to per capita\n\nbirths and deaths. The rates, hence, expressed are change in numbers\n\n(increase or decrease) with respect to members of the population. Here is an\n\nexample. If in a pond there were 20 lotus plants last year and through\n\nreproduction 8 new plants are added, taking the current population to 28,\n\nwe calculate the birth rate as 8/20 = 0.4 offspring per lotus per year. If 4\n\nindividuals in a laboratory population of 40 fruitflies died during a specified\n\ntime interval, say a week, the death rate in the population during that period\n\nis 4/40 = 0.1 individuals per fruitfly per week.\n\nAnother attribute characteristic of a population is sex ratio. An\n\nindividual is either a male or a female but a population has a sex ratio\n\n(e.g., 60 per cent of the population are females and 40 per cent males).\n\nA population at any given time is composed of individuals of\n\ndifferent ages. If the age distribution (per cent individuals of a given\n\nage or age group) is plotted for the population, the resulting structure\n\nis called an age pyramid (Figure 13.4). For human population, the\n\nage pyramids generally show age distribution of males and females in\n\na  diagram. The shape of the pyramids reflects the growth status of\n\nthe population - (a) whether it is growing, (b) stable or (c) declining.\n\nThe size of the population tells us a lot about its status in the habitat.\n\nWhatever ecological processes we wish to investigate in a population, be\n\nit the outcome of competition with another species, the impact of a\n\nFigure 13.4 Representation of age pyramids for human population\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n228\n\nBIOLOGY\n\npredator or the effect of a pesticide application, we always evaluate them\n\nin terms of any change in the population size. The size, in nature, could\n\nbe as low as <10 (Siberian cranes at Bharatpur wetlands in any year) or\n\ngo into millions (Chlamydomonas in a pond). Population size,  technically\n\ncalled population density (designated as N), need not necessarily be\n\nmeasured in numbers only. Although total number is generally the most\n\nappropriate measure of population density, it is in some cases either\n\nmeaningless or difficult to determine.  In an area,  if there are 200 carrot\n\ngrass (Parthenium hysterophorus) plants but only a single huge banyan\n\ntree with a large canopy, stating that the population density of banyan is\n\nlow relative to that of carrot grass amounts to underestimating the\n\nenormous role of the Banyan in that community. In such cases, the per\n\ncent cover or biomass is a more meaningful measure of the population\n\nsize. Total number is again not an easily adoptable measure if the\n\npopulation is huge and counting is impossible or very time-consuming.\n\nIf you have a dense laboratory culture of bacteria  in a petri dish what is\n\nthe best measure to report its density?  Sometimes, for certain ecological\n\ninvestigations, there is no need to know the absolute population densities;\n\nrelative densities serve the purpose equally well.  For instance, the number\n\nof fish caught per trap is good enough measure of its total population\n\ndensity in the lake.  We are mostly obliged to estimate population sizes\n\nindirectly, without actually counting them or seeing them. The tiger census\n\nin our national parks and tiger reserves is often based on pug marks and\n\nfecal pellets.\n\n13.2.2 Population Growth\n\nThe size of a population for any species is not a static parameter.  It keeps\n\nchanging with time, depending on various factors including food\n\navailability, predation pressure and adverse weather.  In fact, it is these\n\nchanges in population density that give us some idea of what is happening\n\nto the population – whether it is flourishing or declining.  Whatever might\n\nbe the ultimate reasons, the density of a population in a given habitat\n\nduring a given period, fluctuates due to changes in four basic processes,\n\ntwo of which (natality and immigration) contribute to an increase in\n\npopulation density and two (mortality and emigration) to a decrease.\n\n(i) Natality refers to the number of births during a given period in the\n\npopulation that are added to the initial density.\n\n(ii) Mortality is the number of deaths in the population during a given\n\nperiod.\n\n(iii) Immigration is the number of individuals of the same species that\n\nhave come into the habitat from elsewhere during the time period\n\nunder consideration.\n\n(iv) Emigration is the number of individuals of the population who\n\nleft the habitat and gone elsewhere during the time period under\n\nconsideration.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n229\n\nORGANISMS AND POPULATIONS\n\nSo, if N is the population density at time t, then its density at time t +1 is\n\nN\nt+1\n\n = N\nt\n + [(B + I) – (D + E)]\n\nYou can see from the above equation (Fig. 13.5) that population\n\ndensity will increase if the number of births plus the number of\n\nimmigrants (B + I) is more than the number of deaths plus the number\n\nof emigrants (D + E).  Under normal conditions, births and deaths are\n\nthe most important factors influencing population density, the other\n\ntwo factors assuming importance only under special conditions.  For\n\ninstance, if a new habitat is just being colonised, immigration may\n\ncontribute more significantly to population growth than birth rates.\n\nGrowth Models : Does the growth of a population with time show any\n\nspecific and predictable pattern? We have been concerned about\n\nunbridled human population growth and problems created by it in our\n\ncountry and it is therefore natural for us to be curious if different animal\n\npopulations in nature behave the same way or show some restraints on\n\ngrowth. Perhaps we can learn a lesson or two from nature on how to\n\ncontrol population growth.\n\n(i) Exponential growth: Resource (food and space) availability is\n\nobviously essential for the unimpeded growth of a population.\n\nIdeally, when resources in the habitat are unlimited, each species\n\nhas the ability to realise fully its innate potential to grow in number,\n\nas Darwin observed while developing his theory of natural\n\nselection. Then the population grows in an exponential or\n\nFigure 13.5\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n230\n\nBIOLOGY\n\ngeometric fashion. If in a population of size N, the birth rates (not\n\ntotal number but per capita births) are represented as b and death\n\nrates (again, per capita death rates) as d, then the increase or\n\ndecrease in N during a unit time period  t  (dN/dt) will be\n\ndN/dt = (b – d) × N\n\nLet (b–d) = r, then\n\ndN/dt = rN\n\nThe r in this equation is called the ‘intrinsic rate of natural increase’\n\nand is a very important parameter chosen for assessing impacts of\n\nany biotic or abiotic factor on population growth.\n\nTo give you some idea about the magnitude of r values, for the\n\nNorway rat the r is 0.015, and for the flour beetle it is 0.12.  In\n\n1981, the r value for human population in India was 0.0205.  Find\n\nout what the current r value is.  For calculating it, you need to\n\nknow the birth rates and death rates.\n\nThe above equation describes the exponential or geometric growth\n\npattern of a population (Figure 13.6) and results in a J-shaped curve\n\nwhen we plot N in relation to time. If you are familiar with basic\n\ncalculus, you can derive the integral form of the\n\nexponential growth equation as\n\nN\nt\n = N\n\n0\n ert\n\n  where\n\nN\nt\n = Population density after time t\n\nN\n0\n = Population density at time zero\n\nr = intrinsic rate of natural increase\n\ne = the base of natural logarithms (2.71828)\n\nAny species growing exponentially under unlimited\n\nresource conditions can reach enormous population\n\ndensities in a short time. Darwin showed how even\n\na slow growing animal like elephant could reach\n\nenormous numbers in the absence of checks. The\n\nfollowing is an anecdote popularly narrated to\n\ndemonstrate dramatically how fast a huge\n\npopulation could build up when growing\n\nexponentially.\n\nThe king and the minister sat for a chess game. The king, confident\n\nof winning the game, was ready to accept any bet proposed by the\n\nminister. The minister humbly said that if he won, he wanted only\n\nsome wheat grains, the quantity of which is to be calculated by placing\n\non the chess board one grain in Square 1, then two in Square 2,\n\nthen four in Square 3, and eight in Square 4, and so on, doubling each\n\ntime the previous quantity of wheat on the next square until all the 64\n\nsquares were filled.  The king accepted the seemingly silly bet and started\n\nFigure 13.6 Population growth curve\na when responses are not\nlimiting the growth, plot is\nexponential,\nb when responses are limiting\nthe growth, plot is logistic,\nK is carrying capacity\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n231\n\nORGANISMS AND POPULATIONS\n\nthe game, but unluckily for him, the minister won. The king felt that fulfilling\n\nthe minister’s bet was so easy.  He started with a single grain on\n\nthe first square and proceeded to fill the other squares following\n\nminister’s suggested procedure, but by the time he covered half the\n\nchess board, the king realised to his dismay that all the wheat\n\nproduced in his entire kingdom pooled together would still be\n\ninadequate to cover all the 64 squares. Now think of a tiny\n\nParamecium starting with just one individual and through binary\n\nfission, doubling in numbers every day, and imagine what a mind-\n\nboggling population size it would reach in 64 days. (provided food\n\nand space remain unlimited)\n\n(ii) Logistic growth: No population of any species in nature has at its\n\ndisposal unlimited resources to permit exponential growth. This\n\nleads to competition between individuals for limited resources.\n\nEventually, the ‘fittest’ individual will survive and reproduce.  The\n\ngovernments of many countries have also realised this fact and\n\nintroduced various restraints with a view to limit human population\n\ngrowth. In nature, a given habitat has enough resources to support\n\na maximum possible number, beyond which no further growth is\n\npossible. Let us call this limit as nature’s carrying capacity (K) for\n\nthat species in that habitat.\n\nA population growing in a habitat with limited resources show\n\ninitially a lag phase, followed by phases of acceleration and\n\ndeceleration and finally an asymptote, when the population density\n\nreaches the carrying capacity. A plot of N in relation to time (t)\n\nresults in a sigmoid curve. This type of population growth is called\n\nVerhulst-Pearl Logistic Growth (Figure 13.6) and is described by\n\nthe following equation:\n\ndN/dt = \nK N\n\nrN\nK\n\n−\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ed \uf8f8\n\nWhere N = Population density at time t\n\nr = Intrinsic rate of natural increase\n\nK = Carrying capacity\n\nSince resources for growth for most animal populations are finite\n\nand become limiting sooner or later, the logistic growth model is\n\nconsidered a more realistic one.\n\nGather from Government Census data the population figures\n\nfor India for the last 100 years, plot them and check which growth\n\npattern is evident.\n\n13.2.3 Life History Variation\n\nPopulations evolve to maximise their reproductive  fitness, also called\n\nDarwinian fitness (high r value), in the habitat in which they live.  Under\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n232\n\nBIOLOGY\n\na particular set of selection pressures, organisms evolve towards the most\n\nefficient reproductive strategy. Some organisms breed only once in their\n\nlifetime (Pacific salmon fish, bamboo) while others breed many times\n\nduring their lifetime (most birds and mammals). Some produce a large\n\nnumber of small-sized offspring (Oysters, pelagic fishes) while others\n\nproduce a small number of large-sized offspring (birds, mammals).  So,\n\nwhich is desirable for maximising fitness?  Ecologists suggest that life\n\nhistory traits of organisms have evolved in relation to the constraints\n\nimposed by the abiotic and biotic components of the habitat in which\n\nthey live. Evolution of life history traits in different species is currently an\n\nimportant area of research being conducted by ecologists.\n\n13.2.4 Population Interactions\n\nCan you think of any natural habitat on earth that is inhabited just by a\n\nsingle species?  There is no such habitat and such a situation is even\n\ninconceivable.  For any species, the minimal requirement is one more\n\nspecies on which it can feed.  Even a plant species, which makes its own\n\nfood, cannot survive alone; it needs soil microbes to break down the organic\n\nmatter in soil and return the inorganic nutrients for absorption. And then,\n\nhow will the plant manage pollination without an animal agent?  It is\n\nobvious that in nature, animals, plants and microbes do not and cannot\n\nlive in isolation but interact in various ways to form a biological\n\ncommunity.  Even in minimal communities, many interactive linkages\n\nexist, although all may not be readily apparent.\n\nInterspecific interactions arise from the interaction of populations of\n\ntwo different species. They could be beneficial, detrimental or neutral\n\n(neither harm nor benefit) to one of the species or both. Assigning a ‘+’\n\nsign for beneficial interaction, ‘-’ sign for detrimental and 0 for neutral\n\ninteraction, let us look at all the possible outcomes of interspecific\n\ninteractions (Table13.1).\n\nBoth the species benefit in mutualism and both lose in competition in\n\ntheir interactions with each other. In both parasitism and predation only\n\none species benefits (parasite and predator, respectively) and the interaction\n\nSpecies A Species B Name of  Interaction\n\n+ + Mutualism\n\n– – Competition\n\n+ – Predation\n\n+ – Parasitism\n\n+ 0 Commensalism\n\n– 0 Amensalism\n\nTable 13.1 : Population Interactions\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n233\n\nORGANISMS AND POPULATIONS\n\nis detrimental to the other species (host and prey, respectively).\n\nThe interaction where one species is benefitted and the other is neither\n\nbenefitted nor harmed is called commensalism. In amensalism on\n\nthe other hand one species is harmed whereas the other is\n\nunaffected. Predation, parasitism and commensalism share a common\n\ncharacteristic– the interacting species live closely together.\n\n(i) Predation: What would happen to all the energy fixed by\n\nautotrophic organisms if the community has no animals to eat the\n\nplants?  You can think of predation as nature’s way of transferring\n\nto higher trophic levels the energy fixed by plants.  When we think\n\nof predator and prey, most probably it is the tiger and the deer that\n\nreadily come to our mind, but a sparrow eating any seed is no less\n\na predator.  Although animals eating plants are categorised\n\nseparately as herbivores, they are, in a broad ecological context,\n\nnot very different from predators.\n\nBesides acting as ‘conduits’ for energy transfer across trophic\n\nlevels, predators play other important roles.  They keep prey\n\npopulations under control. But for predators, prey species could\n\nachieve very high population densities and cause ecosystem\n\ninstability. When certain exotic species are introduced into a\n\ngeographical area, they become invasive and start spreading fast\n\nbecause the invaded land does not have its natural predators. The\n\nprickly pear cactus introduced into Australia in the early 1920’s\n\ncaused havoc by spreading rapidly into millions of hectares of\n\nrangeland.  Finally, the invasive cactus was brought under control\n\nonly after a cactus-feeding predator (a moth) from its natural habitat\n\nwas introduced into the country. Biological control methods adopted\n\nin agricultural pest control are based on the ability of the predator\n\nto regulate prey population. Predators also help in maintaining\n\nspecies diversity in a community, by reducing the intensity of\n\ncompetition among competing prey species.   In the rocky intertidal\n\ncommunities of the American Pacific Coast the starfish Pisaster is\n\nan important predator. In a field experiment, when all the starfish\n\nwere removed from an enclosed intertidal area, more than 10 species\n\nof invertebrates became extinct within a year, because of inter-\n\nspecific competition.\n\nIf a predator is too efficient and overexploits its prey, then the\n\nprey might become extinct and following it, the predator will also\n\nbecome extinct for lack of food. This is the reason why predators in\n\nnature are ‘prudent’. Prey species have evolved various defenses to\n\nlessen the impact of predation.  Some species of insects and frogs\n\nare cryptically-coloured (camouflaged) to avoid being detected easily\n\nby the predator. Some are poisonous and therefore avoided by the\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n234\n\nBIOLOGY\n\npredators.  The Monarch butterfly is highly distasteful to its predator\n\n(bird) because of a special chemical present in its body.\n\nInterestingly, the butterfly acquires this chemical during its\n\ncaterpillar stage by feeding on a poisonous weed.\n\nFor plants, herbivores are the predators. Nearly 25 per cent of\n\nall insects are known to be phytophagous (feeding on plant sap\n\nand other parts of plants).  The problem is particularly severe for\n\nplants because, unlike animals, they cannot run away from their\n\npredators. Plants therefore have evolved an astonishing variety of\n\nmorphological and chemical defences against herbivores. Thorns\n\n(Acacia, Cactus) are the most common morphological means of\n\ndefence. Many plants produce and store chemicals that make the\n\nherbivore sick when they are eaten, inhibit feeding or digestion,\n\ndisrupt its reproduction or even kill it.  You must have seen the\n\nweed Calotropis growing in abandoned fields.  The plant produces\n\nhighly poisonous cardiac glycosides and that is why you never see\n\nany cattle or goats browsing on this plant.  A wide variety of chemical\n\nsubstances that we extract from plants on a commercial scale\n\n(nicotine, caffeine, quinine, strychnine, opium, etc.,) are produced\n\nby them actually as defences against grazers and browsers.\n\n(ii) Competition: When Darwin spoke of the struggle for existence and\n\nsurvival of the fittest in nature, he was convinced that interspecific\n\ncompetition is a potent force in organic evolution. It is generally\n\nbelieved that competition occurs when closely related species\n\ncompete for the same resources that are limiting, but this is not\n\nentirely true. Firstly, totally unrelated species could also compete\n\nfor the same resource. For instance, in some shallow South\n\nAmerican lakes, visiting flamingoes and resident fishes compete for\n\ntheir common food, the zooplankton in the lake. Secondly,\n\nresources need not be limiting for competition to occur; in\n\ninterference competition, the feeding efficiency of one species might\n\nbe reduced due to the interfering and inhibitory presence of the\n\nother species, even if resources (food and space) are abundant.\n\nTherefore, competition is best defined as a process in which the\n\nfitness of one species (measured in terms of its ‘r’ the intrinsic rate\n\nof increase) is significantly lower in the presence of another species.\n\nIt is relatively easy to demonstrate in laboratory experiments, as\n\nGause and other experimental ecologists did,  when resources are\n\nlimited the competitively superior species will eventually eliminate\n\nthe other species, but evidence for such competitive exclusion\n\noccurring in nature is not always conclusive.  Strong and persuasive\n\ncircumstantial evidence does exist however in some cases. The\n\nAbingdon tortoise in Galapagos Islands became extinct within a\n\ndecade after goats were introduced on the island, apparently due\n\nto the greater browsing efficiency of the goats. Another evidence for\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n235\n\nORGANISMS AND POPULATIONS\n\nthe occurrence of competition in nature comes from what is called\n\n‘competitive release’. A species whose distribution is restricted to a\n\nsmall geographical area because of the presence of a competitively\n\nsuperior species, is found to expand its distributional range\n\ndramatically when the competing species is experimentally removed.\n\nConnell’s elegant field experiments showed that on the rocky sea\n\ncoasts of Scotland, the larger and competitively superior barnacle\n\nBalanus dominates the intertidal area, and excludes the smaller\n\nbarnacle Chathamalus from that zone.  In general, herbivores and\n\nplants appear to be more adversely affected by competition than\n\ncarnivores.\n\nGause’s ‘Competitive Exclusion Principle’ states that two\n\nclosely related species competing for the same resources cannot\n\nco-exist indefinitely and the competitively inferior one will be\n\neliminated eventually. This may be true if resources are limiting,\n\nbut not otherwise. More recent studies do not support such gross\n\ngeneralisations about competition.  While they do not rule out the\n\noccurrence of interspecific competition in nature, they point out\n\nthat species facing competition might evolve mechanisms that\n\npromote co-existence rather than exclusion. One such mechanism\n\nis ‘resource partitioning’. If two species compete for the same\n\nresource, they could avoid competition by choosing, for instance,\n\ndifferent times for   feeding or different foraging patterns.  MacArthur\n\nshowed that five closely related species of warblers living on the\n\nsame tree were able to avoid competition and co-exist due to\n\nbehavioural differences in their foraging activities.\n\n(iii) Parasitism: Considering that the parasitic mode of life ensures\n\nfree lodging and meals, it is not surprising that parasitism has\n\nevolved in so many taxonomic groups from plants to higher\n\nvertebrates.  Many parasites have evolved to be host-specific (they\n\ncan parasitise only a single species of host) in such a way that both\n\nhost and the parasite tend to co-evolve; that is, if the host evolves\n\nspecial mechanisms for rejecting or resisting the parasite, the\n\nparasite has to evolve mechanisms to counteract and neutralise\n\nthem, in order to be successful with the same host species. In\n\naccordance with their life styles, parasites evolved special\n\nadaptations such as the loss of unnecessary sense organs, presence\n\nof adhesive organs or suckers to cling on to the host, loss of digestive\n\nsystem and high reproductive capacity. The life cycles of parasites\n\nare often complex, involving one or two intermediate hosts or vectors\n\nto facilitate parasitisation of its primary host. The human liver fluke\n\n(a trematode parasite) depends on two intermediate hosts (a snail\n\nand a fish) to complete its life cycle.  The malarial parasite needs a\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n236\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nvector (mosquito) to spread to other hosts.  Majority of the parasites\n\nharm the host; they may reduce the survival, growth and\n\nreproduction of the host and reduce its population density. They\n\nmight render the host more vulnerable to predation by making it\n\nphysically weak. Do you believe that an ideal parasite should be\n\nable to thrive within the host without harming it? Then why didn’t\n\nnatural selection lead to the evolution of such totally harmless\n\nparasites?\n\nParasites that feed on the external surface of the host organism\n\nare called ectoparasites. The most familiar examples of this group\n\nare the lice on humans and ticks on dogs. Many marine fish are\n\ninfested with ectoparasitic copepods. Cuscuta, a parasitic plant that\n\nis commonly found growing on hedge plants, has lost its chlorophyll\n\nand leaves in the course of evolution. It derives its nutrition from\n\nthe host plant which it parasitises. The female mosquito is not\n\nconsidered a parasite, although it needs our blood for reproduction.\n\nCan you explain why?\n\nIn contrast, endoparasites are those that live inside the host\n\nbody at different sites (liver, kidney, lungs, red blood cells, etc.).\n\nThe life cycles of endoparasites are more complex because of their\n\nextreme specialisation. Their morphological and anatomical features\n\nare greatly simplified while emphasising their reproductive potential.\n\nBrood parasitism in birds is a fascinating example of parasitism\n\nin which the parasitic bird lays its eggs in the nest of its host and\n\nlets the host incubate them. During the course of evolution, the\n\neggs of the parasitic bird have evolved to resemble the host’s egg in\n\nsize and colour to reduce the chances of the host bird detecting the\n\nforeign eggs and ejecting them from the nest. Try to follow the\n\nmovements of the cuckoo (koel) and the crow in your neighborhood\n\npark during the breeding season (spring to summer) and watch\n\nbrood parasitism in action.\n\n(iv) Commensalism: This is the interaction in which one species benefits\n\nand the other is neither harmed nor benefited. An orchid growing\n\nas an epiphyte on a mango branch, and barnacles growing on the\n\nback of a whale benefit while neither the mango tree nor the whale\n\nderives any apparent benefit.   The cattle egret and grazing cattle in\n\nclose association, a sight you are most likely to catch if you live in\n\nfarmed rural areas, is a classic example of commensalism.  The\n\negrets always forage close to where the cattle are grazing because\n\nthe cattle, as they move, stir up and flush out insects from the\n\nvegetation  that otherwise might be difficult for the egrets to find\n\nand catch.  Another example of commensalism is the interaction\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n237\n\nORGANISMS AND POPULATIONS\n\nbetween sea anemone that has stinging tentacles and the clown\n\nfish that lives among them.  The fish gets protection from predators\n\nwhich stay away from the stinging tentacles. The anemone does\n\nnot appear to derive any benefit by hosting the clown fish.\n\n(v) Mutualism: This interaction confers benefits on both the interacting\n\nspecies. Lichens represent an intimate mutualistic relationship\n\nbetween a fungus and photosynthesising algae or cyanobacteria.\n\nSimilarly, the mycorrhizae are associations between fungi and the\n\nroots of higher plants. The fungi help the plant in the absorption of\n\nessential nutrients from the soil while the plant in turn provides the\n\nfungi with energy-yielding carbohydrates.\n\nThe most spectacular and evolutionarily fascinating examples\n\nof mutualism are found in plant-animal relationships.  Plants need\n\nthe help of animals for pollinating their flowers and dispersing their\n\nseeds.  Animals obviously have to be paid ‘fees’ for the services that\n\nplants expect from them.  Plants offer rewards or fees in the form of\n\npollen and nectar for pollinators and juicy and nutritious fruits for\n\nseed dispersers.  But the mutually beneficial system should also\n\nbe safeguarded against ‘cheaters’, for example, animals that try to\n\nsteal nectar without aiding in pollination. Now you can see why\n\nplant-animal interactions often involve co-evolution of the\n\nmutualists, that is, the evolutions of the flower and its pollinator\n\nspecies are tightly linked with one another. In many species of fig\n\ntrees, there is a tight one-to-one relationship with the pollinator\n\nspecies of wasp (Figure 13.7).  It means that a given fig species can\n\nbe pollinated only by its ‘partner’ wasp species and no other species.\n\nThe female wasp uses the fruit not only as an oviposition (egg-laying)\n\nsite but uses the developing seeds within the fruit for nourishing\n\nFigure 13.7 Mutual relationship between fig tree and wasp: (a) Fig flower is pollinated\nby wasp; (b) Wasp laying eggs in a fig fruit\n\n(a) (b)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n238\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nits larvae.  The wasp pollinates the fig inflorescence while\n\nsearching for suitable egg-laying sites. In return for the\n\nfavour of pollination the fig offers the wasp some of its\n\ndeveloping seeds, as food for the developing wasp larvae.\n\nOrchids show a bewildering diversity of floral\n\npatterns many of which have evolved to attract the right\n\npollinator insect (bees and bumblebees) and ensure\n\nguaranteed pollination by it (Figure 13.8). Not all\n\norchids offer rewards. The Mediterranean orchid\n\nOphrys employs ‘sexual deceit’ to get pollination done\n\nby a species of bee.  One petal of its flower bears an\n\nuncanny resemblance to the female of the bee in size,\n\ncolour and markings. The male bee is attracted to what\n\nit perceives as a female, ‘pseudocopulates’ with the\n\nflower, and during that process is dusted with pollen\n\nfrom the flower. When this same bee ‘pseudocopulates’\n\nwith another flower, it transfers pollen to it and thus,\n\npollinates the flower. Here you can see how co-evolution\n\noperates. If the female bee’s colour patterns change even slightly for any\n\nreason during evolution, pollination success will be reduced unless the\n\norchid flower co-evolves to maintain the resemblance of its petal to the\n\nfemale bee.\n\nFigure 13.8 Showing bee-a pollinator\non orchid flower\n\nSUMMARY\n\nAs a branch of biology, Ecology is the study of the relationships of\n\nliving organisms with the abiotic (physico-chemical factors) and biotic\n\ncomponents (other species) of their environment. It is concerned\n\nwith four levels of biological organisation-organisms, populations,\n\ncommunities and biomes.\n\nTemperature, light, water and soil are the most important\n\nphysical factors of the environment to which the organisms are\n\nadapted in various ways. Maintenance of a constant internal\n\nenvironment (homeostasis) by the organisms contributes to optimal\n\nperformance, but only some organisms (regulators) are capable of\n\nhomeostasis in the face of changing external environment. Others\n\neither partially regulate their internal environment or simply\n\nconform. A few other species have evolved adaptations to avoid\n\nunfavourable conditions in space (migration) or in time (aestivation,\n\nhibernation, and diapause).\n\nEvolutionary changes through natural selection take place at\n\nthe population level and hence, population ecology is an important\n\narea of ecology. A population is a group of individuals of a given\n\nspecies sharing or competing for similar resources in a defined\n\ngeographical area. Populations have attributes that individual\n\norganisms do not- birth rates and death rates, sex ratio and age\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n239\n\nORGANISMS AND POPULATIONS\n\ndistribution. The proportion of different age groups of males and\n\nfemales in a population is often presented graphically as age pyramid;\n\nits shape indicates whether a population is stationary, growing or\n\ndeclining.\n\nEcological effects of any factors on a population are generally\n\nreflected in its size (population density), which may be expressed in\n\ndifferent ways (numbers, biomass, per cent cover, etc.,) depending\n\non the species.\n\nPopulations grow through births and immigration and decline\n\nthrough deaths and emigration.  When resources are unlimited, the\n\ngrowth is usually exponential but when resources become\n\nprogressively limiting, the growth pattern turns logistic. In either\n\ncase, growth is ultimately limited by the carrying capacity of the\n\nenvironment. The intrinsic rate of natural increase (r) is a measure\n\nof the inherent potential of a population to grow.\n\nIn nature populations of different species in a habitat do not live\n\nin isolation but interact in many ways.  Depending on the outcome,\n\nthese interactions between two species are classified as competition\n\n(both species suffer), predation and parasitism (one benefits and the\n\nother suffers), commensalism (one benefits and the other is\n\nunaffected), amensalism (one is harmed, other unaffected) and\n\nmutualism (both species benefit).  Predation is a very important\n\nprocess through which trophic energy transfer is facilitated and some\n\npredators help in controlling their prey populations. Plants have\n\nevolved diverse morphological and chemical defenses against\n\nherbivory.  In competition, it is presumed that the superior competitor\n\neliminates the inferior one (the Competitive Exclusion Principle), but\n\nmany closely related species have evolved various mechanisms which\n\nfacilitate their co-existence. Some of the most fascinating cases of\n\nmutualism in nature are seen in plant-pollinator interactions.\n\nEXERCISES\n1. How is diapause different from hibernation?\n\n2.

Many ecologists regard the entire\n\nbiosphere as a global ecosystem, as a composite of all\n\nlocal ecosystems on Earth. Since this system is too much\n\nbig and complex to be studied at one time, it is convenient\n\nto divide it into two basic categories, namely the\n\nterrestrial and the aquatic. Forest, grassland and desert\n\nare some examples of terrestrial ecosystems; pond, lake,\n\nwetland, river and estuary are some examples of aquatic\n\necosystems. Crop fields and an aquarium may also be\n\nconsidered as man-made ecosystems.\n\nWe will first look at the structure of the ecosystem, in\n\norder to appreciate the input (productivity), transfer of\n\nenergy (food chain/web, nutrient cycling) and the output\n\n(degradation and energy loss). We will also look at the\n\nrelationships – cycles, chains, webs – that are created as\n\na result of these energy flows within the system and their\n\ninter- relationship.\n\nCHAPTER 14\n\nECOSYSTEM\n\n14.1 Ecosystem–Structure\n\nand Function\n\n14.2. Productivity\n\n14.3 Decomposition\n\n14.4 Energy Flow\n\n14.5 Ecological Pyramids\n\n14.6 Ecological Succession\n\n14.7 Nutrient Cycling\n\n14.8 Ecosystem Services\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n242\n\nBIOLOGY\n\n14.1 ECOSYSTEM – STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION\n\nIn chapter 13, you have looked at the various components of the\n\nenvironment- abiotic and biotic. You studied how the individual biotic\n\nand abiotic factors affected each other and their surrounding. Let us look\n\nat these components in a more integrated manner and see how the flow of\n\nenergy takes place within these components of the ecosystem.\n\nInteraction of biotic and abiotic components result in a physical\n\nstructure that is characteristic for each type of ecosystem. Identification\n\nand enumeration of plant and animal species of an ecosystem gives its\n\nspecies composition. Vertical distribution of different species occupying\n\ndifferent levels is called stratification. For example, trees occupy top\n\nvertical strata or layer of a forest, shrubs the second and herbs and grasses\n\noccupy the bottom layers.\n\nThe components of the ecosystem are seen to function as a unit when\n\nyou consider the following aspects:\n\n(i) Productivity;\n\n(ii) Decomposition;\n\n(iii) Energy flow; and\n\n(iv) Nutrient cycling.\n\nTo understand the ethos of an aquatic ecosystem let us take a small\n\npond as an example. This is fairly a self-sustainable unit and rather simple\n\nexample that explain even the complex interactions that exist in an aquatic\n\necosystem. A pond is a shallow water body in which all the above\n\nmentioned four basic components of an ecosystem are well exhibited.\n\nThe abiotic component is the water with all the dissolved inorganic and\n\norganic substances and the rich soil deposit at the bottom of the pond.\n\nThe solar input, the cycle of temperature, day-length and other climatic\n\nconditions regulate the rate of function of the entire pond. The autotrophic\n\ncomponents include the phytoplankton, some algae and the floating,\n\nsubmerged and marginal plants found at the edges. The consumers are\n\nrepresented by the zooplankton, the free swimming and bottom dwelling\n\nforms. The decomposers are the fungi, bacteria and flagellates especially\n\nabundant in the bottom of the pond. This system performs all the functions\n\nof any ecosystem and of the biosphere as a whole, i.e., conversion of\n\ninorganic into organic material with the help of the radiant energy of the\n\nsun by the autotrophs; consumption of the autotrophs by heterotrophs;\n\ndecomposition and mineralisation of the dead matter to release them back\n\nfor reuse by the autotrophs, these event are repeated over and over again.\n\nThere is unidirectional movement of energy towards the higher trophic\n\nlevels and its dissipation and loss as heat to the environment.\n\n14.2. PRODUCTIVITY\n\nA constant input of solar energy is the basic requirement for any ecosystem\n\nto function and sustain. Primary production is defined as the amount of\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n243\n\nECOSYSTEM\n\nbiomass or organic matter produced per unit area over a time period by\n\nplants during photosynthesis. It is expressed in terms of weight (gm–2) or\n\nenergy (kcal m–2). The rate of biomass production is called productivity.\n\nIt is expressed in terms of gm–2 yr –1 or (kcal m–2) yr–1 to compare the\n\nproductivity of different ecosystems. It can be divided into gross primary\n\nproductivity (GPP) and net primary productivity (NPP). Gross primary\n\nproductivity of an ecosystem is the rate of production of organic matter\n\nduring photosynthesis. A considerable amount of GPP is utilised by plants\n\nin respiration. Gross primary productivity minus respiration losses (R),\n\nis the net primary productivity (NPP).\n\nGPP – R = NPP\n\nNet primary productivity is the available biomass for the consumption\n\nto heterotrophs (herbiviores and decomposers). Secondary productivity\n\nis defined as the rate of formation of new organic matter by\n\nconsumers.\n\nPrimary productivity depends on the plant species inhabiting a\n\nparticular area. It also depends on a variety of environmental factors,\n\navailability of nutrients and photosynthetic capacity of plants. Therefore,\n\nit varies in different types of ecosystems. The annual net primary\n\nproductivity of the whole biosphere is approximately 170 billion tons\n\n(dry weight) of organic matter. Of this, despite occupying about 70 per\n\ncent of the surface, the productivity of the oceans are only 55 billion tons.\n\nRest of course, is on land. Discuss the main reason for the low\n\nproductivity of ocean with your teacher.\n\n14.3 DECOMPOSITION\n\nYou may have heard of the earthworm being referred to as the farmer’s\n\n‘friend’. This is so because they help in the breakdown of complex organic\n\nmatter as well as in loosening of the soil. Similarly,  decomposers break\n\ndown complex organic matter into inorganic substances like carbon\n\ndioxide, water and nutrients and the process is called decomposition.\n\nDead plant remains such as leaves, bark, flowers and dead remains of\n\nanimals, including fecal matter, constitute detritus, which is the raw\n\nmaterial for decomposition. The important steps in the process of\n\ndecomposition are fragmentation, leaching, catabolism, humification and\n\nmineralisation.\n\nDetritivores (e.g., earthworm) break down detritus into smaller particles.\n\nThis process is called fragmentation. By the process of leaching, water-\n\nsoluble inorganic nutrients go down into the soil horizon and get precipitated\n\nas unavailable salts. Bacterial and fungal enzymes degrade detritus into\n\nsimpler inorganic substances. This process is called as catabolism.\n\nIt is important to note that all the above steps in decomposition  operate\n\nsimultaneously on the detritus (Figure 14.1). Humification and\n\nmineralisation occur during decomposition in the soil. Humification leads\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n244\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nto accumulation of a dark coloured amorphous substance called humus\n\nthat is highly resistant to microbial action and undergoes decomposition\n\nat an extremely slow rate. Being colloidal in nature it serves as a reservoir\n\nof nutrients. The humus is further degraded by some microbes and release\n\nof inorganic nutrients occur by the process  known as mineralisation.\n\nDecomposition is largely an oxygen-requiring process. The rate of\n\ndecomposition is controlled by chemical composition of detritus and\n\nclimatic factors. In a particular climatic condition, decomposition rate\n\nis slower if detritus is rich in lignin and chitin, and quicker, if detritus is\n\nrich in nitrogen and water-soluble substances like sugars. Temperature\n\nand soil moisture are the most important climatic factors that regulate\n\ndecomposition through their effects on the activities of soil microbes.\n\nWarm and moist environment favour decomposition whereas low\n\ntemperature and anaerobiosis inhibit decomposition resulting in build\n\nup of organic materials.\n\nFigure 14.1 Diagrammatic representation of decomposition cycle in a terrestrial ecosystem\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n245\n\nECOSYSTEM\n\n14.4 ENERGY FLOW\n\nExcept for the deep sea hydro-thermal ecosystem, sun is the only source\n\nof energy for all ecosystems on Earth.  Of the incident solar radiation less\n\nthan 50 per cent of it is photosynthetically active radiation (PAR).  We\n\nknow that plants and photosynthetic bacteria (autotrophs), fix Sun’s\n\nradiant energy to make food from simple inorganic materials. Plants\n\ncapture only 2-10  per cent of the PAR and this small amount of energy\n\nsustains the entire living world.  So, it is very important to know how the\n\nsolar energy captured by plants flows through different organisms of an\n\necosystem. All organisms are dependent for their food on producers, either\n\ndirectly or indirectly. So you find unidirectional flow of energy from the\n\nsun to producers and then to consumers. Is this in keeping with the first\n\nlaw of thermodynamics?\n\nFurther, ecosystems are not exempt from the Second Law of\n\nthermodynamics. They need a constant supply of energy to synthesise\n\nthe molecules they require, to counteract the universal tendency toward\n\nincreasing disorderliness.\n\nThe green plant in the ecosystem are called producers. In a terrestrial\n\necosystem, major producers are herbaceous and woody plants. Likewise,\n\nproducers in an aquatic ecosystem are various species like phytoplankton,\n\nalgae and higher plants.\n\nYou have read about the food chains and webs that exist in nature.\n\nStarting from the plants (or producers) food chains or rather webs are\n\nformed such that an animal feeds on a plant or on another animal and in\n\nturn is food for another. The chain or web is formed because of this\n\ninterdependency. No energy that is trapped into an organism remains in\n\nit for ever. The energy trapped by the producer, hence, is either passed on\n\nto a consumer or the organism dies. Death of organism is the beginning\n\nof the detritus food chain/web.\n\nAll animals depend on plants (directly or indirectly) for their food needs.\n\nThey are hence called consumers and also heterotrophs.  If they feed on\n\nthe producers, the plants, they are called primary consumers, and if the\n\nanimals eat other animals which in turn eat the plants (or their produce)\n\nthey are called secondary consumers. Likewise, you could have tertiary\n\nconsumers too.  Obviously the primary consumers will be herbivores.\n\nSome common herbivores are insects, birds and mammals in terrestrial\n\necosystem and molluscs in aquatic ecosystem.\n\nThe consumers that feed on these herbivores are carnivores, or more\n\ncorrectly primary carnivores (though secondary consumers). Those\n\nanimals that depend on the primary carnivores for food are labelled\n\nsecondary carnivores. A simple grazing food chain (GFC) is depicted\n\nbelow:\n\n Grass                            Goat                               Man\n\n   (Producer)                 (Primary Consumer) (Secondary consumer)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n246\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nThe detritus food chain (DFC) begins with dead organic matter. It is\n\nmade up of decomposers which are heterotrophic organisms, mainly\n\nfungi and bacteria. They meet their energy and nutrient requirements by\n\ndegrading dead organic matter or detritus. These are also known as\n\nsaprotrophs (sapro: to decompose). Decomposers secrete digestive\n\nenzymes that breakdown dead and waste materials into simple, inorganic\n\nmaterials, which are subsequently absorbed by them.\n\nIn an aquatic ecosystem, GFC is the major conduit for energy flow.\n\nAs against this, in a terrestrial ecosystem, a much larger fraction of energy\n\nflows through the detritus food chain than through the GFC. Detritus\n\nfood chain may be connected with the grazing food chain at some levels:\n\nsome of the organisms of DFC are prey to the GFC animals, and in a natural\n\necosystem, some animals like cockroaches, crows, etc., are omnivores.\n\nThese natural interconnection of food chains make it a  food web. How\n\nwould you classify human beings!\n\nOrganisms occupy a place in the natural surroundings or in a\n\ncommunity according to their feeding relationship with other organisms.\n\nBased on the source of their nutrition or food, organisms occupy a specific\n\nplace in the food chain that is known as their trophic level. Producers\n\nbelong to the first trophic level, herbivores (primary consumer) to the\n\nsecond and carnivores (secondary consumer) to the third (Figure 14.2).\n\nFigure 14.2 Diagrammatic representation of trophic levels in an ecosystem\n\n246\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n247\n\nECOSYSTEM\n\nFigure 14.3 Energy flow through different trophic levels\n\n247\n\nThe important point to note is that the amount of energy decreases at\n\nsuccessive trophic levels.  When any organism dies it is converted to\n\ndetritus or dead biomass that serves as an energy source for decomposers.\n\nOrganisms at each trophic level depend on those at the lower trophic level\n\nfor their energy demands.\n\nEach trophic level has a certain mass of living material at a particular\n\ntime called as the standing crop. The standing crop is measured as the\n\nmass of living organisms (biomass) or the number in a unit area. The\n\nbiomass of a species is expressed in terms of fresh or dry weight.\n\nMeasurement of biomass in terms of dry weight is more accurate. Why?\n\nThe number of trophic levels in the grazing food chain is restricted as\n\nthe transfer of energy follows 10 per cent law – only 10 per cent of the\n\nenergy is transferred to each trophic level from the lower trophic level.  In\n\nnature, it is possible to have so many levels – producer, herbivore, primary\n\ncarnivore, secondary carnivore in the grazing food chain (Figure 14.3) .\n\nDo you think there is any such limitation in a detritus food chain?\n\n14.5 ECOLOGICAL PYRAMIDS\n\nYou must be familiar with the shape of a pyramid. The base of a pyramid\n\nis broad and it narrows towards the apex. One gets a similar shape,\n\nwhether you express the food or energy relationship between organisms\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n248\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nat different trophic levels. This, relationship is expressed in terms of\n\nnumber, biomass or energy. The base of each pyramid represents the\n\nproducers or the first trophic level while the apex represents tertiary or\n\ntop level consumer. The three types of ecological pyramids that are usually\n\nstudied are (a) pyramid of number; (b) pyramid of biomass and (c) pyramid\n\nof energy. For detail (see Figure 14.4 a, b, c and d).\n\nFigure 14.4 (a) Pyramid of numbers in a grassland ecosystem. Only three top-carnivores are\nsupported in an ecosystem based on production of nearly 6 millions plants\n\nFigure 14.4 (b) Pyramid of biomass shows a sharp decrease in biomass at higher trophic levels\n\nFigure 14.4 (c) Inverted pyramid of biomass-small standing crop of phytoplankton supports large\nstanding crop of zooplankton\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n249\n\nECOSYSTEM\n\nFigure 14.4 (d) An ideal pyramid of energy. Observe that primary producers convert only 1% of\n  the energy in the sunlight available to them into NPP\n\nAny calculations of energy content, biomass or numbers, has to include\n\nall organisms at that trophic level.  No generalisations we make will be\n\ntrue if we take only a few individuals at any trophic level into account.\n\nAlso a given organism may occupy more than one trophic level\n\nsimultaneously. One must remember that the trophic level represents a\n\nfunctional level, not a species as such. A given species may occupy more\n\nthan one trophic level in the same ecosystem at the same time; for example,\n\na sparrow is a primary consumer when it eats seeds, fruits, peas, and a\n\nsecondary consumer when it eats insects and worms. Can you work out\n\nhow many trophic levels human beings function at in a food chain?\n\nIn most ecosystems, all the pyramids, of number, of energy and\n\nbiomass are upright, i.e., producers are more in number and biomass\n\nthan the herbivores, and herbivores are more in number and biomass\n\nthan the carnivores.  Also energy at a lower trophic level is always more\n\nthan at a higher level.\n\nThere are exceptions to this generalisation: If you were to count the\n\nnumber of insects feeding on a big tree what kind of pyramid would you\n\nget?  Now add an estimate of the number of small birds depending on the\n\ninsects, as also the number of larger birds eating the smaller. Draw the\n\nshape you would get.\n\nThe pyramid of biomass in sea is generally inverted because the\n\nbiomass of fishes far exceeds that of phytoplankton. Isn’t that a paradox?\n\nHow would you explain this?\n\nPyramid of energy is always upright, can never be inverted,  because\n\nwhen energy flows from a particular trophic level to the next trophic level,\n\nsome energy is always lost as heat at each step. Each bar in the energy\n\npyramid indicates the amount of energy present at each trophic level in a\n\ngiven time or annually per unit area.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n250\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nHowever, there are certain limitations of ecological pyramids such as\n\nit does not take into account the same species belonging to two or more\n\ntrophic levels. It assumes a simple food chain, something that almost\n\nnever exists in nature; it does not accommodate a food web. Moreover,\n\nsaprophytes are not given any place in ecological pyramids even though\n\nthey play a vital role in the ecosystem.\n\n14.6 ECOLOGICAL SUCCESSION\n\nYou have learnt in Chapter 13, the characteristics of population and\n\ncommunity and also their response to environment and how such\n\nresponses vary from an individual response. Let us examine another aspect\n\nof community response to environment over time.\n\nAn important characteristic of all communities is that their\n\ncomposition and structure constantly change in response to the changing\n\nenvironmental conditions. This change is orderly and sequential, parallel\n\nwith the changes in the physical environment. These changes lead finally\n\nto a community that is in near equilibrium with the environment and\n\nthat is called a climax community. The gradual and fairly predictable\n\nchange in the species composition of a given area is called ecological\n\nsuccession. During succession some species colonise an area and  their\n\npopulation become more numerous whereas populations of other species\n\ndecline and even disappear.\n\nThe entire sequence of communities that successively change in a\n\ngiven area are called sere(s). The individual transitional communities are\n\ntermed seral stages or seral communities. In the successive seral stages\n\nthere is a change in the diversity of species of organisms, increase in the\n\nnumber of species and organisms as well as an increase in the total biomass.\n\nThe present day communities in the world have come to be because\n\nof succession that has occurred over millions of years since life started on\n\nearth. Actually succession and evolution would have been parallel\n\nprocesses at that time.\n\nSuccession is hence a process that starts in an area where no living\n\norganisms are there – these could be areas where no living organisms\n\never existed, say bare rock; or in areas that somehow, lost all the living\n\norganisms that existed there.  The former is called primary succession,\n\nwhile the latter is termed secondary succession.\n\nExamples of areas where primary succession occurs are newly cooled\n\nlava, bare rock, newly created pond or reservoir. The establishment of a\n\nnew biotic community is generally slow. Before a biotic community of\n\ndiverse organisms can become established, there must be soil. Depending\n\nmostly on the climate, it takes natural processes several hundred to several\n\nthousand years to produce fertile soil on bare rock.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n251\n\nECOSYSTEM\n\nSecondary succession begins in areas where natural biotic\n\ncommunities have been destroyed such as in abandoned farm lands,\n\nburned or cut forests, lands that have been flooded. Since some soil or\n\nsediment is present, succession is faster than primary succession.\n\nDescription of ecological succession usually focuses on changes in\n\nvegetation. However, these vegetational changes in turn affect food and\n\nshelter for various types of animals. Thus, as succession proceeds, the\n\nnumbers and types of animals and decomposers also change.\n\nAt any time during primary or secondary succession, natural or\n\nhuman induced disturbances (fire, deforestation, etc.), can convert a\n\nparticular seral stage of succession to an earlier stage. Also such\n\ndisturbances create new conditions that encourage some species and\n\ndiscourage or eliminate other species.\n\n14.6.1 Succession of Plants\n\nBased on the nature of the habitat – whether it is water (or very wet areas)\n\nor it is on very dry areas – succession of plants is called hydrarch or\n\nxerarch, respectively. Hydrarch succession takes place in wet areas and\n\nthe successional series progress from hydric to the mesic conditions. As\n\nagainst this, xerarch succession takes place in dry areas and the series\n\nprogress from xeric to mesic conditions. Hence, both hydrarch and xerarch\n\nsuccessions lead to medium water conditions (mesic) – neither too dry\n\n(xeric) nor too wet (hydric).\n\nThe species that invade a bare area are called pioneer species. In\n\nprimary succession on rocks these are usually lichens which are able to\n\nsecrete acids to dissolve rock, helping in weathering and soil formation.\n\nThese later pave way to some very small plants like bryophytes, which\n\nare able to take hold in the small amount of soil. They are, with time,\n\nsucceeded by higher plants, and after several more stages, ultimately a\n\nstable climax forest community is formed. The climax community remains\n\nstable as long as the environment remains unchanged. With time the\n\nxerophytic habitat gets converted into a mesophytic one.\n\nIn primary succession in water, the pioneers are the small\n\nphytoplanktons, which are replaced with time by rooted-submerged plants,\n\nrooted-floating angiosperms followed by free-floating plants, then reed-\n\nswamp, marsh-meadow, scrub  and finally the trees.  The climax again would\n\nbe a forest. With time the water body is converted into land (Figure 14.5).\n\nIn secondary succession the species that invade depend on the\n\ncondition of the soil, availability of water, the environment as also the\n\nseeds or other propagules present. Since soil is already there, the rate of\n\nsuccession is much faster and hence,  climax is also reached more quickly.\n\nWhat is important to understand is that succession, particularly\n\nprimary succession, is a very slow process, taking maybe thousands of\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n252\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nyears for the climax to be reached. Another important fact is to understand\n\nthat all succession whether taking place in water or on land, proceeds to\n\na similar climax community – the mesic.\n\nFigure 14.5 Diagrammatic representation of primary succession\n\n(a) (d)\n\n(b) (e)\n\n(c)\n(f)\n\n(g)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n253\n\nECOSYSTEM\n\n14.7 NUTRIENT CYCLING\n\nYou have studied in Class XI that organisms need a constant supply of\n\nnutrients to grow, reproduce and regulate various body functions. The\n\namount of nutrients, such as carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, etc.,\n\npresent in the soil at any given time, is referred to as the standing state. It\n\nvaries in different kinds of ecosystems and also on a seasonal basis.\n\nWhat is important is to appreciate that nutrients which are never lost\n\nfrom the ecosystems, rather they are recycled time and again indefinitely.\n\nThe movement of nutrient elements through the various components of\n\nan ecosystem is called nutrient cycling. Another name of nutrient cycling\n\nis biogeochemical cycles (bio: living organism, geo: rocks, air, water).\n\nNutrient cycles are of two types: (a) gaseous and (b) sedimentary. The\n\nFigure 14.6 Simplified model of carbon cycle in the biosphere\n\nreservoir for gaseous type of nutrient cycle (e.g., nitrogen, carbon cycle)\n\nexists in the atmosphere and for the sedimentary cycle (e.g., sulphur and\n\nphosphorus cycle), the reservoir is located in Earth’s crust. Environmental\n\nfactors, e.g., soil, moisture, pH, temperature, etc., regulate the rate of\n\nrelease of nutrients into the atmosphere. The function of the reservoir is\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n254\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nto meet with the deficit which occurs due to imbalance in the rate of influx\n\nand efflux.\n\nYou have made a detailed study of nitrogen cycle in class XI. Here we\n\ndiscuss carbon and phosphorus cycles.\n\n14.7.1 Ecosystem – Carbon Cycle\n\nWhen you study the composition of living organisms, carbon constitutes\n\n49 per cent of dry weight of organisms and is next only to water. If we\n\nlook at the total quantity of global carbon, we find that 71 per cent carbon\n\nis found dissolved in oceans. This oceanic reservoir regulates the amount\n\nof carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (Figure 14.6). Do you know that the\n\natmosphere only contains about 1per cent of total global carbon?\n\nFossil fuel also represent a reservoir of carbon. Carbon cycling occurs\n\nthrough atmosphere, ocean and through living and dead organisms.\n\nAccording to one estimate 4 × 1013 kg of carbon is fixed annually in the\n\nbiosphere through photosynthesis. A considerable amount of carbon\n\nreturns to the atmosphere as CO\n2\n through respiratory activities of the\n\nproducers and consumers. Decomposers also contribute substantially\n\nto CO\n2\n pool by their processing of waste materials and dead organic matter\n\nof land or oceans. Some amount of the fixed carbon is lost to sediments\n\nand removed from circulation. Burning of wood, forest fire and combustion\n\nof organic matter, fossil fuel, volcanic activity are additional sources for\n\nreleasing CO\n2\n in the atmosphere.\n\nHuman activities have significantly influenced the carbon cycle. Rapid\n\ndeforestation and massive burning of fossil fuel for energy and transport\n\nhave significantly increased the rate of release of carbon dioxide into the\n\natmosphere (see greenhouse effect in Chapter 16).\n\n14.7.2 Ecosystem – Phosphorus Cycle\n\nPhosphorus is a major constituent of biological membranes, nucleic acids\n\nand cellular energy transfer systems. Many animals also need large\n\nquantities of this element to make shells, bones and teeth. The natural\n\nreservoir of phosphorus is rock, which contains phosphorus in the form\n\nof phosphates. When rocks are weathered, minute amounts of these\n\nphosphates dissolve in soil solution and are absorbed by the roots of the\n\nplants (Figure 14.7). Herbivores and other animals obtain this element\n\nfrom plants. The waste products and the dead organisms are decomposed\n\nby phosphate-solubilising bacteria releasing phosphorus. Unlike carbon\n\ncycle, there is no respiratory release of phosphorus into atmosphere. Can\n\nyou differentiate between the carbon and the phosphorus cycle?\n\nThe other two major and important differences between carbon and\n\nphosphorus cycle are firstly, atmospheric inputs of phosphorus through\n\nrainfall are much smaller than carbon inputs, and, secondly, gaseous\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n255\n\nECOSYSTEM\n\nexchanges of phosphorus between organism and environment are\n\nnegligible.\n\n14.8 ECOSYSTEM SERVICES\n\nHealthy ecosystems are the base for a wide range of economic,\n\nenvironmental and aesthetic goods and services. The products of\n\necosystem processes are named as ecosystem services, for example,\n\nhealthy forest ecosystems purify air and water, mitigate droughts and\n\nfloods, cycle nutrients, generate fertile soils, provide wildlife habitat,\n\nmaintain biodiversity, pollinate crops, provide storage site for carbon\n\nand also provide aesthetic, cultural and spiritual values. Though value\n\nof such services of biodiversity is difficult to determine, it seems\n\nreasonable to think that biodiversity should carry a hefty price tag.\n\nRobert Constanza and his colleagues have very recently tried to\n\nput price tags on nature’s life-support services. Researchers have put\n\nan average price tag of US $ 33 trillion a year on these fundamental\n\necosystems services, which are largely taken for granted because they\n\nare free. This is nearly twice the value of the global gross national\n\nproduct GNP which is (US $ 18 trillion).\n\nOut of the total cost of various ecosystem services, the soil\n\nformation accounts for about 50 per cent, and contributions of other\n\nservices like recreation and nutrient cycling, are less than 10 per\n\ncent each. The cost of climate regulation and habitat for wildlife are\n\nabout 6 per cent each.\n\nFigure 14.7 A simplified model of phosphorus cycling in a terrestrial\necosystem\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n256\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nSUMMARY\n\nAn ecosystem is a structural and functional unit of nature and it\ncomprises abiotic and biotic components. Abiotic components are\ninorganic materials- air, water and soil, whereas biotic components\nare producers, consumers and decomposers. Each ecosystem has\ncharacteristic physical structure resulting from interaction amongst\nabiotic and biotic components. Species composition and stratification\nare the two main structural features of an ecosystem. Based on source\nof nutrition every organism occupies a place in an ecosystem.\n\nProductivity, decomposition, energy flow, and nutrient cycling are\nthe four important components of an ecosystem. Primary productivity\nis the rate of capture of solar energy or biomass production of the\nproducers. It is divided into two types: gross primary productivity (GPP)\nand net primary productivity (NPP). Rate of capture of solar energy or\ntotal production of organic matter is called as GPP. NPP is the remaining\nbiomass or the energy left after utilisation of producers. Secondary\nproductivity is the rate of assimilation of food energy by the consumers.\nIn decomposition, complex organic compounds of detritus are converted\nto carbon dioxide, water and inorganic nutrients by the decomposers.\nDecomposition involves three processes, namely fragmentation of\ndetritus, leaching and catabolism.\n\nEnergy flow is unidirectional. First, plants capture solar energy\nand then, food is transferred from the producers to decomposers.\nOrganisms of different trophic levels in nature are connected to each\nother for food or energy relationship forming a food chain. The storage\nand movement of nutrient elements through the various components\nof the ecosystem is called nutrient cycling; nutrients are repeatedly\nused through this process. Nutrient cycling is of two types—gaseous\nand sedimentary. Atmosphere or hydrosphere is the reservoir for the\ngaseous type of cycle (carbon), whereas Earth’s crust is the reservoir\nfor sedimentary type (phosphorus). Products of ecosystem processes\nare named as ecosystem services, e.g., purification of air and water by\nforests.\n\nThe biotic community is dynamic and undergoes changes with the\npassage of time. These changes are sequentially ordered and constitute\necological succession. Succession begins with invasion of a bare lifeless\narea by pioneers which later pave way for successors and ultimately a\nstable climax community is formed. The climax community remains\nstable as long as the environment remains unchanged.\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1.

Even for humans, the rich variety\n\nof living organisms with which they share this planet never\n\nceases to astonish and fascinate us.  The common man\n\nwould find it hard to believe that there are more than\n\n20,000 species of ants, 3,00,000 species of beetles, 28,000\n\nspecies of fishes and nearly 20,000 species of orchids.\n\nEcologists and evolutionary biologists have been trying\n\nto understand the significance of such diversity by asking\n\nimportant questions– Why are there so many species?\n\nDid such great diversity exist throughout earth’s history?\n\nHow did this diversification come about?  How and why\n\nis this diversity important to the biosphere? Would it\n\nfunction any differently if the diversity was much less?\n\nHow do humans benefit from the diversity of life?\n\n15.1 BIODIVERSITY\n\nIn our biosphere immense diversity (or heterogeneity)\n\nexists not only at the species level but at all levels of\n\nbiological organisation ranging from macromolecules\n\nwithin cells to biomes.  Biodiversity is the term popularised\n\nby the sociobiologist Edward Wilson to describe the\n\nCHAPTER 15\n\nBIODIVERSITY AND\n\nCONSERVATION\n\n15.1 Biodiversity\n\n15.2 Biodiversity Conservation\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n259\n\nBIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION\n\ncombined diversity at all the levels of biological organisation.\n\nThe most important of them are–\n\n(i) Genetic diversity : A single species might show high diversity at\n\nthe genetic level over its distributional range. The genetic variation\n\nshown by the medicinal plant Rauwolfia vomitoria growing in\n\ndifferent Himalayan ranges might be in terms of the potency and\n\nconcentration of the active chemical (reserpine) that the plant\n\nproduces. India has more than 50,000 genetically different strains\n\nof rice, and 1,000 varieties of mango.\n\n(ii) Species diversity :  The diversity at the species level, for example,\n\nthe Western Ghats have a greater amphibian species diversity than\n\nthe Eastern Ghats.\n\n(iii) Ecological diversity: At the ecosystem level, India, for instance,\n\nwith its deserts, rain forests, mangroves, coral reefs, wetlands,\n\nestuaries, and alpine meadows has a greater ecosystem diversity\n\nthan a Scandinavian country like Norway.\n\nIt has taken millions of years of evolution, to accumulate this rich\n\ndiversity in nature, but we could lose all that wealth in less than two\n\ncenturies if the present rates of species losses continue.  Biodiversity and\n\nits conservation are now vital environmental issues of international concern\n\nas more and more people around the world begin to realise the critical\n\nimportance of biodiversity for our survival and well- being on this planet.\n\n15.1.1 How Many Species are there on Earth and How\nMany in India?\n\nSince there are published records of all the species discovered and named,\n\nwe know how many species in all have been recorded so far, but it is not\n\neasy to answer the question of how many species there are on earth.\n\nAccording to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and\n\nNatural Resources (IUCN) (2004), the total number of plant and animal\n\nspecies described so far is slightly more than 1.5 million, but we have no\n\nclear idea of how many species are yet to be discovered and described.\n\nEstimates vary widely and many of them are only educated guesses. For\n\nmany taxonomic groups, species inventories are more complete in\n\ntemperate than in tropical countries. Considering that an overwhelmingly\n\nlarge proportion of the species waiting to be discovered are in the tropics,\n\nbiologists make a statistical comparison of the temperate-tropical species\n\nrichness of an exhaustively studied group of insects and extrapolate this\n\nratio to other groups of animals and plants to come up with a gross\n\nestimate of the total number of species on earth.  Some extreme estimates\n\nrange from 20 to 50 million, but a more conservative and scientifically\n\nsound estimate made by Robert May places the global species diversity\n\nat about 7 million.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n260\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nLet us look at some interesting aspects about earth’s biodiversity based\n\non the currently available species inventories. More than 70 per cent of\n\nall the species recorded are animals, while plants (including algae, fungi,\n\nbryophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms) comprise no more than 22\n\nper cent of the total.  Among animals, insects are the most species-rich\n\ntaxonomic group, making up more than 70 per cent of the total. That\n\nmeans, out of every 10 animals on this planet, 7 are insects. Again, how\n\ndo we explain this enormous diversification of insects? The number of\n\nfungi species in the world is more than the combined total of the species\n\nof fishes, amphibians, reptiles and mammals. In Figure 15.1, biodiversity\n\nis depicted showing species number of major taxa.\n\nFigure 15.1 Representing global biodiversity: proportionate number of\nspecies of major taxa of plants, invertebrates and vertebrates\n\nIt should be noted that these estimates do not give any figures for\n\nprokaryotes. Biologists are not sure about how many prokaryotic species\n\nthere might be. The problem is that conventional taxonomic methods are\n\nnot suitable for identifying microbial species and many species are simply\n\nnot culturable under laboratory conditions.  If we accept biochemical or\n\nmolecular criteria for delineating species for this group, then their diversity\n\nalone might run into millions.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n261\n\nBIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION\n\nAlthough India has only 2.4 per cent of the world’s land area, its share\n\nof the global species diversity is an impressive 8.1 per cent. That is what\n\nmakes our country one of the 12 mega diversity countries of the world.\n\nNearly 45,000 species of plants and twice as many of animals have been\n\nrecorded from India.  How many living species are actually there waiting\n\nto be discovered and named?  If we accept May’s global estimates, only\n\n22 per cent of the total species have been recorded so far. Applying this\n\nproportion to India’s diversity figures, we estimate that there are probably\n\nmore than 1,00,000 plant species and more than 3,00,000 animal species\n\nyet to be discovered and described.  Would we ever be able to complete\n\nthe inventory of the biological wealth of our country?  Consider the immense\n\ntrained manpower (taxonomists) and the time required to complete the\n\njob. The situation appears more hopeless when we realise that a large\n\nfraction of these species faces the threat of becoming extinct even before\n\nwe discover them.  Nature’s biological library is burning even before we\n\ncatalogued the titles of all the books stocked there.\n\n15.1.2 Patterns of Biodiversity\n\n(i) Latitudinal gradients : The diversity of plants and animals is\n\nnot uniform throughout the world but shows a rather uneven\n\ndistribution. For many group of animals or plants, there are\n\ninteresting patterns in diversity, the most well- known being the\n\nlatitudinal gradient in diversity. In general, species diversity\n\ndecreases as we move away from the equator towards the poles.\n\nWith very few exceptions, tropics (latitudinal range of 23.5° N to\n\n23.5° S) harbour more species than temperate or polar areas.\n\nColombia located near the equator has nearly 1,400 species of birds\n\nwhile New York at 41° N has 105 species and Greenland at 71° N\n\nonly 56 species. India, with much of its land area in the tropical\n\nlatitudes, has more than 1,200 species of birds.  A forest in a tropical\n\nregion like Equador has up to 10 times as many species of vascular\n\nplants as a forest of equal area in a temperate region like the Midwest\n\nof the USA.  The largely tropical Amazonian rain forest in South\n\nAmerica has the greatest biodiversity on earth- it is home to more\n\nthan 40,000 species of plants, 3,000 of fishes, 1,300 of birds, 427\n\nof mammals, 427 of amphibians, 378 of reptiles and of more than\n\n1,25,000 invertebrates. Scientists estimate that in these rain forests\n\nthere might be at least two million insect species waiting to be\n\ndiscovered and named.\n\nWhat is so special about tropics that might account for their greater\n\nbiological diversity? Ecologists and evolutionary biologists have\n\nproposed various hypotheses; some important ones are (a) Speciation\n\nis generally a function of time, unlike temperate regions subjected\n\nto frequent glaciations in the past, tropical latitudes have remained\n\nrelatively undisturbed for millions of years and thus, had a long\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n262\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nevolutionary time for species diversification, (b) Tropical environments,\n\nunlike temperate ones, are less seasonal, relatively more constant\n\nand predictable. Such constant environments promote niche\n\nspecialisation and lead to a greater species diversity and (c) There\n\nis more solar energy available in the tropics, which contributes to\n\nhigher productivity; this in turn might contribute indirectly to greater\n\ndiversity.\n\n(ii) Species-Area relationships : During his pioneering and extensive\n\nexplorations in the wilderness of South American jungles, the great\n\nGerman naturalist and geographer Alexander von Humboldt\n\nobserved that within a region species\n\nrichness increased with increasing\n\nexplored area, but only up to a limit.  In\n\nfact, the relation between species richness\n\nand area for a wide variety of taxa\n\n(angiosperm plants, birds, bats,\n\nfreshwater fishes) turns out to be a\n\nrectangular hyperbola (Figure15.2). On\n\na logarithmic scale, the relationship is a\n\nstraight line described by the equation\n\nlog S =  log C + Z log A\n\nwhere\n\nS= Species richness A= Area\n\nZ = slope of the line (regression\n\n     coefficient)\n\nC = Y-intercept\n\nEcologists have discovered that the\n\nvalue of Z lies in the range of 0.1 to 0.2,\n\nregardless of the taxonomic group or the\n\nregion (whether it is the plants in Britain,\n\nbirds in California or molluscs in New York state, the slopes of the regression\n\nline are amazingly similar).  But, if you analyse the species-area\n\nrelationships among very large areas like the entire continents, you will\n\nfind that the slope of the line to be much steeper (Z values in the range\n\nof 0.6 to 1.2).  For example, for frugivorous (fruit-eating) birds and\n\nmammals in the tropical forests of different continents, the slope is found\n\nto be 1.15. What do steeper slopes mean in this context?\n\n15.1.3 The importance of  Species Diversity to the Ecosystem\n\nDoes the number of species in a community really matter to the functioning\n\nof the ecosystem?This is a question for which ecologists have not been\n\nable to give a definitive answer.  For many decades, ecologists believed\n\nthat communities with more species,  generally, tend to be more stable\n\nthan those with less species.  What exactly is stability for a biological\n\nFigure 15.2 Showing species area relationship.\nNote that on log scale the relationship\nbecomes linear\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n263\n\nBIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION\n\ncommunity?  A stable community should not show too much variation\n\nin productivity from year to year; it must be either resistant or resilient to\n\noccasional disturbances (natural or man-made), and it must also be\n\nresistant to invasions by alien species. We don’t know how these attributes\n\nare linked to species richness in a community, but David Tilman’s\n\nlong-term ecosystem experiments using outdoor plots provide some\n\ntentative answers.  Tilman found that plots with more species showed\n\nless year-to-year variation in total biomass.  He also showed that in his\n\nexperiments, increased diversity contributed to higher productivity.\n\nAlthough, we may not understand completely how species richness\n\ncontributes to the well-being of an ecosystem, we know enough to realise\n\nthat  rich biodiversity is not only essential for ecosystem health but\n\nimperative for the very survival of the human race on this planet.  At a\n\ntime when we are losing species at an alarming pace,  one might ask–\n\nDoes it really matter to us if a few species become extinct?  Would Western\n\nGhats ecosystems be less functional if one of its tree frog species is lost\n\nforever? How is our quality of life affected if, say, instead of 20,000 we\n\nhave only 15,000 species of ants on earth?\n\nThere are no direct answers to such näive questions but we can develop\n\na proper perspective through an analogy (the ‘rivet popper hypothesis’)\n\nused by Stanford ecologist Paul Ehrlich.  In an airplane (ecosystem) all\n\nparts are joined together using thousands of rivets (species).  If every\n\npassenger travelling in it starts popping a rivet to take home (causing a\n\nspecies to become extinct), it may not affect flight safety (proper functioning\n\nof the ecosystem) initially,  but as more and more rivets are removed, the\n\nplane becomes dangerously weak over a period of time.  Furthermore,\n\nwhich rivet is removed may also be critical.  Loss of rivets on the wings\n\n(key species that drive major ecosystem functions) is obviously a more\n\nserious threat to flight safety than loss of a few rivets on the seats or\n\nwindows inside the plane.\n\n15.1.4 Loss of Biodiversity\n\nWhile it is doubtful if any new species are being added (through speciation)\n\ninto the earth’s treasury of species, there is no doubt about their continuing\n\nlosses.  The biological wealth of our planet has been declining rapidly\n\nand the accusing finger is clearly pointing to human activities. The\n\ncolonisation of tropical Pacific Islands by humans is said to have led to\n\nthe extinction of more than 2,000 species of native birds. The IUCN Red\n\nList (2004) documents the extinction of 784 species (including 338\n\nvertebrates, 359 invertebrates and 87 plants) in the last 500 years.  Some\n\nexamples of recent extinctions include the dodo (Mauritius), quagga\n\n(Africa), thylacine (Australia), Steller’s Sea Cow (Russia) and three\n\nsubspecies (Bali, Javan, Caspian) of tiger.  The last twenty years alone\n\nhave witnessed the disappearance of 27 species. Careful analysis of records\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n264\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nshows that extinctions across taxa are not random; some groups like\n\namphibians appear to be more vulnerable to extinction.  Adding to the\n\ngrim scenario of extinctions is the fact that more than 15,500 species\n\nworld-wide are facing the threat of extinction.  Presently, 12 per cent of\n\nall bird species, 23 per cent of all mammal species, 32 per cent of all\n\namphibian species and 31per cent of all gymnosperm species in the world\n\nface the threat of extinction.\n\nFrom a study of the history of life on earth through fossil records, we\n\nlearn that large-scale loss of species like the one we are currently\n\nwitnessing have also happened earlier, even before humans appeared on\n\nthe scene.  During the long period (> 3 billion years) since the origin and\n\ndiversification of life on earth there were five episodes of mass extinction\n\nof species. How is the ‘Sixth Extinction’ presently in progress different\n\nfrom the previous episodes? The difference is in the rates; the current\n\nspecies extinction rates are estimated to be 100 to 1,000 times faster\n\nthan in the pre-human times and our activities are responsible for the\n\nfaster rates. Ecologists warn that if the present trends continue,\n\nnearly half of all the species on earth might be wiped out within the next\n\n100 years.\n\nIn general, loss of biodiversity in a region may lead to (a) decline in\n\nplant production, (b) lowered resistance to environmental perturbations\n\nsuch as drought and (c) increased variability in certain ecosystem processes\n\nsuch as plant productivity, water use, and pest and disease cycles.\n\nCauses of biodiversity losses: The accelerated rates of species\n\nextinctions that the world is facing now are largely due to human\n\nactivities. There are four major causes (‘ The Evil Quartet ’ is the sobriquet\n\nused to describe them).\n\n(i) Habitat loss and fragmentation:  This is the most important\n\ncause driving animals and plants to extinction.  The most dramatic\n\nexamples of habitat loss come from tropical rain forests. Once\n\ncovering more than 14 per cent of the earth’s land surface, these\n\nrain forests now cover no more than 6 per cent.  They are being\n\ndestroyed fast.  By the time you finish reading this chapter, 1000\n\nmore hectares of rain forest would have been lost.  The Amazon\n\nrain forest (it is so huge that it is called the ‘lungs of the planet’)\n\nharbouring probably millions of species is being cut and cleared\n\nfor cultivating soya beans or for conversion to grasslands for raising\n\nbeef cattle.  Besides total loss, the degradation of many habitats by\n\npollution also threatens the survival of many species.  When large\n\nhabitats are broken up into small fragments due to various human\n\nactivities, mammals and birds requiring large territories and certain\n\nanimals with migratory habits are badly affected, leading to\n\npopulation declines.\n\n(ii) Over-exploitation:  Humans have always depended on nature for\n\nfood and shelter, but when ‘need’ turns to ‘greed’, it leads to\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n265\n\nBIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION\n\nover-exploitation of natural resources. Many species extinctions\n\nin the last 500 years (Steller’s sea cow, passenger pigeon) were due\n\nto overexploitation by humans. Presently many marine fish\n\npopulations around the world are over harvested, endangering the\n\ncontinued existence of some commercially important species.\n\n(iii) Alien species invasions: When alien species are introduced\n\nunintentionally or deliberately for whatever purpose, some of them\n\nturn invasive, and cause decline or extinction of indigenous species.\n\nThe Nile perch introduced into Lake Victoria in east Africa led\n\neventually to the extinction of an ecologically unique assemblage of\n\nmore than 200 species of cichlid fish in the lake. You must be\n\nfamiliar with the environmental damage caused and threat posed\n\nto our native species by invasive weed species like carrot grass\n\n(Parthenium), Lantana and water hyacinth (Eicchornia).  The recent\n\nillegal introduction of the African catfish Clarias gariepinus for\n\naquaculture purposes is posing a threat to the indigenous catfishes\n\nin our rivers.\n\n(iv) Co-extinctions:  When a species becomes extinct, the plant and\n\nanimal species associated with it in an obligatory way also become\n\nextinct. When a host fish species becomes extinct, its unique\n\nassemblage of parasites also meets the same fate. Another example\n\nis the case of a coevolved plant-pollinator mutualism where\n\nextinction of one invariably leads to the extinction of the other.\n\n15.2 BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION\n\n15.2.1 Why Should We Conserve Biodiversity?\n\nThere are many reasons, some obvious and others not so obvious, but all\n\nequally important. They can be grouped into three categories: narrowly\n\nutilitarian, broadly utilitarian, and ethical.\n\nThe narrowly utilitarian arguments for conserving biodiversity are\n\nobvious; humans derive countless direct economic benefits from nature-\n\nfood (cereals, pulses, fruits), firewood, fibre, construction material,\n\nindustrial products (tannins, lubricants, dyes, resins, perfumes ) and\n\nproducts of medicinal importance.  More than 25 per cent of the drugs\n\ncurrently sold in the market worldwide are derived from plants and 25,000\n\nspecies of plants contribute to the traditional medicines used by native\n\npeoples around the world.  Nobody knows how many more medicinally\n\nuseful plants there are in tropical rain forests waiting to be explored.\n\nWith increasing resources put into ‘bioprospecting’ (exploring molecular,\n\ngenetic and species-level diversity for products of economic importance),\n\nnations endowed with rich biodiversity can expect to reap enormous\n\nbenefits.\n\nThe broadly utilitarian argument says that biodiversity plays a\n\nmajor role in many ecosystem services that nature provides.   The fast-\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n266\n\nBIOLOGY\n\ndwindling Amazon forest is estimated to produce, through\n\nphotosynthesis, 20 per cent of the total oxygen in the earth’s atmosphere.\n\nCan we put an economic value on this service by nature? You can get\n\nsome idea by finding out how much your neighborhood hospital spends\n\non a cylinder of oxygen.  Pollination (without which plants cannot give\n\nus fruits or seeds) is another service, ecosystems provide through\n\npollinators layer – bees, bumblebees, birds and bats. What will be the\n\ncosts of accomplishing pollination without help from natural\n\npollinators? There are other intangible benefits – that we derive from\n\nnature–the aesthetic pleasures of walking through thick woods, watching\n\nspring flowers in full bloom or waking up to a bulbul’s song in the\n\nmorning. Can we put a price tag on such things?\n\nThe ethical argument for conserving biodiversity relates to what we\n\nowe to millions of plant, animal and microbe species with whom we share\n\nthis planet. Philosophically or spiritually, we need to realise that every\n\nspecies has an intrinsic value, even if it may not be of current or any\n\neconomic value to us.  We have a moral duty to care for their well-being\n\nand pass on our biological legacy in good order to future generations.\n\n15.2.2 How do we conserve Biodiversity?\n\nWhen we conserve and protect the whole ecosystem, its biodiversity at all\n\nlevels is protected - we save the entire forest to save the tiger.  This approach\n\nis called in situ (on site) conservation. However, when there are situations\n\nwhere an animal or plant is endangered or threatened (organisms facing\n\na very high risk of extinction in the wild in the near future) and needs\n\nurgent measures to save it from extinction, ex situ (off site) conservation\n\nis the desirable approach.\n\nIn situ conservation– Faced with the conflict between development and\n\nconservation, many nations find it unrealistic and economically not feasible\n\nto conserve all their biological wealth. Invariably, the number of species\n\nwaiting to be saved from extinction far exceeds the conservation resources\n\navailable. On a global basis, this problem has been addressed by eminent\n\nconservationists. They identified for maximum protection certain\n\n‘biodiversity hotspots’ regions with very high levels of species richness\n\nand high degree of endemism (that is, species confined to that region\n\nand not found anywhere else).  Initially 25 biodiversity hotspots were\n\nidentified but subsequently nine more have been added to the list,\n\nbringing the total number of biodiversity hotspots in the world to 34.\n\nThese hotspots are also regions of accelerated habitat loss. Three of\n\nthese hotspots – Western Ghats and Sri Lanka, Indo-Burma and\n\nHimalaya – cover our country’s exceptionally high biodiversity regions.\n\nAlthough all the biodiversity hotspots put together cover less than\n\n2 per cent of the earth’s land area, the number of species they collectively\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n267\n\nBIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION\n\nharbour is extremely high and strict protection of these hotspots could\n\nreduce the ongoing mass extinctions by almost 30 per cent.\n\nIn India, ecologically unique and biodiversity-rich regions are legally\n\nprotected as biosphere reserves, national parks and sanctuaries.  India\n\nnow has 14 biosphere reserves, 90 national parks and 448 wildlife\n\nsanctuaries.  India has also a history of religious and cultural traditions\n\nthat emphasised protection of nature.  In many cultures, tracts of forest\n\nwere set aside, and all the trees and wildlife within were venerated and\n\ngiven total protection.  Such sacred groves are found in Khasi and Jaintia\n\nHills in Meghalaya, Aravalli Hills of Rajasthan, Western Ghat regions of\n\nKarnataka and Maharashtra and the Sarguja, Chanda and Bastar areas\n\nof Madhya Pradesh. In Meghalaya, the sacred groves are the last refuges\n\nfor a large number of rare and threatened plants.\n\nEx situ Conservation– In this approach, threatened animals and plants\n\nare taken out from their natural habitat and placed in special setting\n\nwhere they can be protected and given special care.  Zoological parks,\n\nbotanical gardens and wildlife safari parks serve this purpose. There are\n\nmany animals that have become extinct in the wild but continue to be\n\nmaintained in zoological parks.  In recent years ex situ conservation has\n\nadvanced beyond keeping threatened species in enclosures.  Now gametes\n\nof threatened species can be preserved in viable and fertile condition for\n\nlong periods using cryopreservation techniques, eggs can be fertilised in\n\nvitro, and plants can be propagated using tissue culture methods.  Seeds\n\nof different genetic strains of commercially important plants can be kept\n\nfor long periods in seed banks.\n\nBiodiversity knows no political boundaries and its conservation is\n\ntherefore a collective responsibility of all nations.  The historic Convention\n\non Biological Diversity (‘The Earth Summit’) held in Rio de Janeiro in\n\n1992, called upon all nations to take appropriate measures for\n\nconservation of biodiversity and sustainable utilisation of its benefits.  In\n\na follow-up, the World Summit on Sustainable Development held in 2002\n\nin Johannesburg, South Africa, 190 countries pledged their commitment\n\nto achieve by 2010, a significant reduction in the current rate of biodiversity\n\nloss at global, regional and local levels.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nSince life originated on earth nearly 3.8 billion years ago, there had\nbeen enormous diversification of life forms on earth. Biodiversity refers\nto the sum total of diversity that exists at all levels of biological\norganisation.  Of particular importance is the diversity at genetic, species\nand ecosystem levels and conservation efforts are aimed at protecting\ndiversity at all these levels.\n\nMore than 1.5 million species have been recorded in the world, but\nthere might still be nearly 6 million species on earth waiting to be\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n268\n\nBIOLOGY\n\ndiscovered and named.  Of the named species, > 70 per cent are animals,\nof which 70 per cent are insects.  The group Fungi has more species\nthan all the vertebrate species combined.  India, with about 45,000\nspecies of plants and twice as many species of animals, is one of the 12\nmega diversity countries of the world.\n\nSpecies diversity on earth is not uniformly distributed but shows\ninteresting patterns.  It is generally highest in the tropics and decreases\ntowards the poles. Important explanations for the species richness of\nthe tropics are: Tropics had more evolutionary time; they provide a\nrelatively constant environment and, they receive more solar energy\nwhich contributes to greater productivity. Species richness is also\nfunction of the area of a region; the species-area relationship is generally\na rectangular hyperbolic function.\n\nIt is believed that communities with high diversity tend to be less\nvariable, more productive and more resistant to biological invasions.\nEarth’s fossil history reveals incidence of mass extinctions in the past,\nbut the present rates of extinction, largely attributed to human activities,\nare 100 to 1000 times higher.  Nearly 700 species have become extinct\nin recent times and more than 15,500 species (of which > 650 are from\nIndia) currently face the threat of extinction.  The causes of high\nextinction rates at present include habitat (particularly forests) loss\nand fragmentation, over -exploitation, biological invasions and\nco-extinctions.\n\nEarth’s rich biodiversity is vital for the very survival of mankind.\nThe reasons for conserving biodiversity are narrowly utilitarian, broadly\nutilitarian and ethical.  Besides the direct benefits (food, fibre, firewood,\npharmaceuticals, etc.), there are many indirect benefits we receive\nthrough ecosystem services such as pollination, pest control, climate\nmoderation and flood control. We also have a moral responsibility to\ntake good care of earth’s biodiversity and pass it on in good order to our\nnext generation.\n\nBiodiversity conservation may be in situ as well as ex situ.  In in situ\nconservation, the endangered species are protected in their natural\nhabitat so that the entire ecosystem is protected. Recently, 34\n‘biodiversity hotspots’ in the world have been proposed for intensive\nconservation efforts. Of these, three (Western Ghats-Sri Lanka,\nHimalaya and Indo-Burma) cover India’s rich biodiversity regions. Our\ncountry’s in situ conservation efforts are reflected in its 14 biosphere\nreserves, 90 national parks, > 450 wildlife sanctuaries and many sacred\ngroves. Ex situ conservation methods include protective maintenance\nof threatened species in zoological parks and botanical gardens, in vitro\nfertilisation, tissue culture propagation and cryopreservation of\ngametes.\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1.

Even for humans, the rich variety\n\nof living organisms with which they share this planet never\n\nceases to astonish and fascinate us.  The common man\n\nwould find it hard to believe that there are more than\n\n20,000 species of ants, 3,00,000 species of beetles, 28,000\n\nspecies of fishes and nearly 20,000 species of orchids.\n\nEcologists and evolutionary biologists have been trying\n\nto understand the significance of such diversity by asking\n\nimportant questions– Why are there so many species?\n\nDid such great diversity exist throughout earth’s history?\n\nHow did this diversification come about?  How and why\n\nis this diversity important to the biosphere? Would it\n\nfunction any differently if the diversity was much less?\n\nHow do humans benefit from the diversity of life?\n\n15.1 BIODIVERSITY\n\nIn our biosphere immense diversity (or heterogeneity)\n\nexists not only at the species level but at all levels of\n\nbiological organisation ranging from macromolecules\n\nwithin cells to biomes.  Biodiversity is the term popularised\n\nby the sociobiologist Edward Wilson to describe the\n\nCHAPTER 15\n\nBIODIVERSITY AND\n\nCONSERVATION\n\n15.1 Biodiversity\n\n15.2 Biodiversity Conservation\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n259\n\nBIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION\n\ncombined diversity at all the levels of biological organisation.\n\nThe most important of them are–\n\n(i) Genetic diversity : A single species might show high diversity at\n\nthe genetic level over its distributional range. The genetic variation\n\nshown by the medicinal plant Rauwolfia vomitoria growing in\n\ndifferent Himalayan ranges might be in terms of the potency and\n\nconcentration of the active chemical (reserpine) that the plant\n\nproduces. India has more than 50,000 genetically different strains\n\nof rice, and 1,000 varieties of mango.\n\n(ii) Species diversity :  The diversity at the species level, for example,\n\nthe Western Ghats have a greater amphibian species diversity than\n\nthe Eastern Ghats.\n\n(iii) Ecological diversity: At the ecosystem level, India, for instance,\n\nwith its deserts, rain forests, mangroves, coral reefs, wetlands,\n\nestuaries, and alpine meadows has a greater ecosystem diversity\n\nthan a Scandinavian country like Norway.\n\nIt has taken millions of years of evolution, to accumulate this rich\n\ndiversity in nature, but we could lose all that wealth in less than two\n\ncenturies if the present rates of species losses continue.  Biodiversity and\n\nits conservation are now vital environmental issues of international concern\n\nas more and more people around the world begin to realise the critical\n\nimportance of biodiversity for our survival and well- being on this planet.\n\n15.1.1 How Many Species are there on Earth and How\nMany in India?\n\nSince there are published records of all the species discovered and named,\n\nwe know how many species in all have been recorded so far, but it is not\n\neasy to answer the question of how many species there are on earth.\n\nAccording to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and\n\nNatural Resources (IUCN) (2004), the total number of plant and animal\n\nspecies described so far is slightly more than 1.5 million, but we have no\n\nclear idea of how many species are yet to be discovered and described.\n\nEstimates vary widely and many of them are only educated guesses. For\n\nmany taxonomic groups, species inventories are more complete in\n\ntemperate than in tropical countries. Considering that an overwhelmingly\n\nlarge proportion of the species waiting to be discovered are in the tropics,\n\nbiologists make a statistical comparison of the temperate-tropical species\n\nrichness of an exhaustively studied group of insects and extrapolate this\n\nratio to other groups of animals and plants to come up with a gross\n\nestimate of the total number of species on earth.  Some extreme estimates\n\nrange from 20 to 50 million, but a more conservative and scientifically\n\nsound estimate made by Robert May places the global species diversity\n\nat about 7 million.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n260\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nLet us look at some interesting aspects about earth’s biodiversity based\n\non the currently available species inventories. More than 70 per cent of\n\nall the species recorded are animals, while plants (including algae, fungi,\n\nbryophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms) comprise no more than 22\n\nper cent of the total.  Among animals, insects are the most species-rich\n\ntaxonomic group, making up more than 70 per cent of the total. That\n\nmeans, out of every 10 animals on this planet, 7 are insects. Again, how\n\ndo we explain this enormous diversification of insects? The number of\n\nfungi species in the world is more than the combined total of the species\n\nof fishes, amphibians, reptiles and mammals. In Figure 15.1, biodiversity\n\nis depicted showing species number of major taxa.\n\nFigure 15.1 Representing global biodiversity: proportionate number of\nspecies of major taxa of plants, invertebrates and vertebrates\n\nIt should be noted that these estimates do not give any figures for\n\nprokaryotes. Biologists are not sure about how many prokaryotic species\n\nthere might be. The problem is that conventional taxonomic methods are\n\nnot suitable for identifying microbial species and many species are simply\n\nnot culturable under laboratory conditions.  If we accept biochemical or\n\nmolecular criteria for delineating species for this group, then their diversity\n\nalone might run into millions.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n261\n\nBIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION\n\nAlthough India has only 2.4 per cent of the world’s land area, its share\n\nof the global species diversity is an impressive 8.1 per cent. That is what\n\nmakes our country one of the 12 mega diversity countries of the world.\n\nNearly 45,000 species of plants and twice as many of animals have been\n\nrecorded from India.  How many living species are actually there waiting\n\nto be discovered and named?  If we accept May’s global estimates, only\n\n22 per cent of the total species have been recorded so far. Applying this\n\nproportion to India’s diversity figures, we estimate that there are probably\n\nmore than 1,00,000 plant species and more than 3,00,000 animal species\n\nyet to be discovered and described.  Would we ever be able to complete\n\nthe inventory of the biological wealth of our country?  Consider the immense\n\ntrained manpower (taxonomists) and the time required to complete the\n\njob. The situation appears more hopeless when we realise that a large\n\nfraction of these species faces the threat of becoming extinct even before\n\nwe discover them.  Nature’s biological library is burning even before we\n\ncatalogued the titles of all the books stocked there.\n\n15.1.2 Patterns of Biodiversity\n\n(i) Latitudinal gradients : The diversity of plants and animals is\n\nnot uniform throughout the world but shows a rather uneven\n\ndistribution. For many group of animals or plants, there are\n\ninteresting patterns in diversity, the most well- known being the\n\nlatitudinal gradient in diversity. In general, species diversity\n\ndecreases as we move away from the equator towards the poles.\n\nWith very few exceptions, tropics (latitudinal range of 23.5° N to\n\n23.5° S) harbour more species than temperate or polar areas.\n\nColombia located near the equator has nearly 1,400 species of birds\n\nwhile New York at 41° N has 105 species and Greenland at 71° N\n\nonly 56 species. India, with much of its land area in the tropical\n\nlatitudes, has more than 1,200 species of birds.  A forest in a tropical\n\nregion like Equador has up to 10 times as many species of vascular\n\nplants as a forest of equal area in a temperate region like the Midwest\n\nof the USA.  The largely tropical Amazonian rain forest in South\n\nAmerica has the greatest biodiversity on earth- it is home to more\n\nthan 40,000 species of plants, 3,000 of fishes, 1,300 of birds, 427\n\nof mammals, 427 of amphibians, 378 of reptiles and of more than\n\n1,25,000 invertebrates. Scientists estimate that in these rain forests\n\nthere might be at least two million insect species waiting to be\n\ndiscovered and named.\n\nWhat is so special about tropics that might account for their greater\n\nbiological diversity? Ecologists and evolutionary biologists have\n\nproposed various hypotheses; some important ones are (a) Speciation\n\nis generally a function of time, unlike temperate regions subjected\n\nto frequent glaciations in the past, tropical latitudes have remained\n\nrelatively undisturbed for millions of years and thus, had a long\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n262\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nevolutionary time for species diversification, (b) Tropical environments,\n\nunlike temperate ones, are less seasonal, relatively more constant\n\nand predictable. Such constant environments promote niche\n\nspecialisation and lead to a greater species diversity and (c) There\n\nis more solar energy available in the tropics, which contributes to\n\nhigher productivity; this in turn might contribute indirectly to greater\n\ndiversity.\n\n(ii) Species-Area relationships : During his pioneering and extensive\n\nexplorations in the wilderness of South American jungles, the great\n\nGerman naturalist and geographer Alexander von Humboldt\n\nobserved that within a region species\n\nrichness increased with increasing\n\nexplored area, but only up to a limit.  In\n\nfact, the relation between species richness\n\nand area for a wide variety of taxa\n\n(angiosperm plants, birds, bats,\n\nfreshwater fishes) turns out to be a\n\nrectangular hyperbola (Figure15.2). On\n\na logarithmic scale, the relationship is a\n\nstraight line described by the equation\n\nlog S =  log C + Z log A\n\nwhere\n\nS= Species richness A= Area\n\nZ = slope of the line (regression\n\n     coefficient)\n\nC = Y-intercept\n\nEcologists have discovered that the\n\nvalue of Z lies in the range of 0.1 to 0.2,\n\nregardless of the taxonomic group or the\n\nregion (whether it is the plants in Britain,\n\nbirds in California or molluscs in New York state, the slopes of the regression\n\nline are amazingly similar).  But, if you analyse the species-area\n\nrelationships among very large areas like the entire continents, you will\n\nfind that the slope of the line to be much steeper (Z values in the range\n\nof 0.6 to 1.2).  For example, for frugivorous (fruit-eating) birds and\n\nmammals in the tropical forests of different continents, the slope is found\n\nto be 1.15. What do steeper slopes mean in this context?\n\n15.1.3 The importance of  Species Diversity to the Ecosystem\n\nDoes the number of species in a community really matter to the functioning\n\nof the ecosystem?This is a question for which ecologists have not been\n\nable to give a definitive answer.  For many decades, ecologists believed\n\nthat communities with more species,  generally, tend to be more stable\n\nthan those with less species.  What exactly is stability for a biological\n\nFigure 15.2 Showing species area relationship.\nNote that on log scale the relationship\nbecomes linear\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n263\n\nBIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION\n\ncommunity?  A stable community should not show too much variation\n\nin productivity from year to year; it must be either resistant or resilient to\n\noccasional disturbances (natural or man-made), and it must also be\n\nresistant to invasions by alien species. We don’t know how these attributes\n\nare linked to species richness in a community, but David Tilman’s\n\nlong-term ecosystem experiments using outdoor plots provide some\n\ntentative answers.  Tilman found that plots with more species showed\n\nless year-to-year variation in total biomass.  He also showed that in his\n\nexperiments, increased diversity contributed to higher productivity.\n\nAlthough, we may not understand completely how species richness\n\ncontributes to the well-being of an ecosystem, we know enough to realise\n\nthat  rich biodiversity is not only essential for ecosystem health but\n\nimperative for the very survival of the human race on this planet.  At a\n\ntime when we are losing species at an alarming pace,  one might ask–\n\nDoes it really matter to us if a few species become extinct?  Would Western\n\nGhats ecosystems be less functional if one of its tree frog species is lost\n\nforever? How is our quality of life affected if, say, instead of 20,000 we\n\nhave only 15,000 species of ants on earth?\n\nThere are no direct answers to such näive questions but we can develop\n\na proper perspective through an analogy (the ‘rivet popper hypothesis’)\n\nused by Stanford ecologist Paul Ehrlich.  In an airplane (ecosystem) all\n\nparts are joined together using thousands of rivets (species).  If every\n\npassenger travelling in it starts popping a rivet to take home (causing a\n\nspecies to become extinct), it may not affect flight safety (proper functioning\n\nof the ecosystem) initially,  but as more and more rivets are removed, the\n\nplane becomes dangerously weak over a period of time.  Furthermore,\n\nwhich rivet is removed may also be critical.  Loss of rivets on the wings\n\n(key species that drive major ecosystem functions) is obviously a more\n\nserious threat to flight safety than loss of a few rivets on the seats or\n\nwindows inside the plane.\n\n15.1.4 Loss of Biodiversity\n\nWhile it is doubtful if any new species are being added (through speciation)\n\ninto the earth’s treasury of species, there is no doubt about their continuing\n\nlosses.  The biological wealth of our planet has been declining rapidly\n\nand the accusing finger is clearly pointing to human activities. The\n\ncolonisation of tropical Pacific Islands by humans is said to have led to\n\nthe extinction of more than 2,000 species of native birds. The IUCN Red\n\nList (2004) documents the extinction of 784 species (including 338\n\nvertebrates, 359 invertebrates and 87 plants) in the last 500 years.  Some\n\nexamples of recent extinctions include the dodo (Mauritius), quagga\n\n(Africa), thylacine (Australia), Steller’s Sea Cow (Russia) and three\n\nsubspecies (Bali, Javan, Caspian) of tiger.  The last twenty years alone\n\nhave witnessed the disappearance of 27 species. Careful analysis of records\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n264\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nshows that extinctions across taxa are not random; some groups like\n\namphibians appear to be more vulnerable to extinction.  Adding to the\n\ngrim scenario of extinctions is the fact that more than 15,500 species\n\nworld-wide are facing the threat of extinction.  Presently, 12 per cent of\n\nall bird species, 23 per cent of all mammal species, 32 per cent of all\n\namphibian species and 31per cent of all gymnosperm species in the world\n\nface the threat of extinction.\n\nFrom a study of the history of life on earth through fossil records, we\n\nlearn that large-scale loss of species like the one we are currently\n\nwitnessing have also happened earlier, even before humans appeared on\n\nthe scene.  During the long period (> 3 billion years) since the origin and\n\ndiversification of life on earth there were five episodes of mass extinction\n\nof species. How is the ‘Sixth Extinction’ presently in progress different\n\nfrom the previous episodes? The difference is in the rates; the current\n\nspecies extinction rates are estimated to be 100 to 1,000 times faster\n\nthan in the pre-human times and our activities are responsible for the\n\nfaster rates. Ecologists warn that if the present trends continue,\n\nnearly half of all the species on earth might be wiped out within the next\n\n100 years.\n\nIn general, loss of biodiversity in a region may lead to (a) decline in\n\nplant production, (b) lowered resistance to environmental perturbations\n\nsuch as drought and (c) increased variability in certain ecosystem processes\n\nsuch as plant productivity, water use, and pest and disease cycles.\n\nCauses of biodiversity losses: The accelerated rates of species\n\nextinctions that the world is facing now are largely due to human\n\nactivities. There are four major causes (‘ The Evil Quartet ’ is the sobriquet\n\nused to describe them).\n\n(i) Habitat loss and fragmentation:  This is the most important\n\ncause driving animals and plants to extinction.  The most dramatic\n\nexamples of habitat loss come from tropical rain forests. Once\n\ncovering more than 14 per cent of the earth’s land surface, these\n\nrain forests now cover no more than 6 per cent.  They are being\n\ndestroyed fast.  By the time you finish reading this chapter, 1000\n\nmore hectares of rain forest would have been lost.  The Amazon\n\nrain forest (it is so huge that it is called the ‘lungs of the planet’)\n\nharbouring probably millions of species is being cut and cleared\n\nfor cultivating soya beans or for conversion to grasslands for raising\n\nbeef cattle.  Besides total loss, the degradation of many habitats by\n\npollution also threatens the survival of many species.  When large\n\nhabitats are broken up into small fragments due to various human\n\nactivities, mammals and birds requiring large territories and certain\n\nanimals with migratory habits are badly affected, leading to\n\npopulation declines.\n\n(ii) Over-exploitation:  Humans have always depended on nature for\n\nfood and shelter, but when ‘need’ turns to ‘greed’, it leads to\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n265\n\nBIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION\n\nover-exploitation of natural resources. Many species extinctions\n\nin the last 500 years (Steller’s sea cow, passenger pigeon) were due\n\nto overexploitation by humans. Presently many marine fish\n\npopulations around the world are over harvested, endangering the\n\ncontinued existence of some commercially important species.\n\n(iii) Alien species invasions: When alien species are introduced\n\nunintentionally or deliberately for whatever purpose, some of them\n\nturn invasive, and cause decline or extinction of indigenous species.\n\nThe Nile perch introduced into Lake Victoria in east Africa led\n\neventually to the extinction of an ecologically unique assemblage of\n\nmore than 200 species of cichlid fish in the lake. You must be\n\nfamiliar with the environmental damage caused and threat posed\n\nto our native species by invasive weed species like carrot grass\n\n(Parthenium), Lantana and water hyacinth (Eicchornia).  The recent\n\nillegal introduction of the African catfish Clarias gariepinus for\n\naquaculture purposes is posing a threat to the indigenous catfishes\n\nin our rivers.\n\n(iv) Co-extinctions:  When a species becomes extinct, the plant and\n\nanimal species associated with it in an obligatory way also become\n\nextinct. When a host fish species becomes extinct, its unique\n\nassemblage of parasites also meets the same fate. Another example\n\nis the case of a coevolved plant-pollinator mutualism where\n\nextinction of one invariably leads to the extinction of the other.\n\n15.2 BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION\n\n15.2.1 Why Should We Conserve Biodiversity?\n\nThere are many reasons, some obvious and others not so obvious, but all\n\nequally important. They can be grouped into three categories: narrowly\n\nutilitarian, broadly utilitarian, and ethical.\n\nThe narrowly utilitarian arguments for conserving biodiversity are\n\nobvious; humans derive countless direct economic benefits from nature-\n\nfood (cereals, pulses, fruits), firewood, fibre, construction material,\n\nindustrial products (tannins, lubricants, dyes, resins, perfumes ) and\n\nproducts of medicinal importance.  More than 25 per cent of the drugs\n\ncurrently sold in the market worldwide are derived from plants and 25,000\n\nspecies of plants contribute to the traditional medicines used by native\n\npeoples around the world.  Nobody knows how many more medicinally\n\nuseful plants there are in tropical rain forests waiting to be explored.\n\nWith increasing resources put into ‘bioprospecting’ (exploring molecular,\n\ngenetic and species-level diversity for products of economic importance),\n\nnations endowed with rich biodiversity can expect to reap enormous\n\nbenefits.\n\nThe broadly utilitarian argument says that biodiversity plays a\n\nmajor role in many ecosystem services that nature provides.   The fast-\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n266\n\nBIOLOGY\n\ndwindling Amazon forest is estimated to produce, through\n\nphotosynthesis, 20 per cent of the total oxygen in the earth’s atmosphere.\n\nCan we put an economic value on this service by nature? You can get\n\nsome idea by finding out how much your neighborhood hospital spends\n\non a cylinder of oxygen.  Pollination (without which plants cannot give\n\nus fruits or seeds) is another service, ecosystems provide through\n\npollinators layer – bees, bumblebees, birds and bats. What will be the\n\ncosts of accomplishing pollination without help from natural\n\npollinators? There are other intangible benefits – that we derive from\n\nnature–the aesthetic pleasures of walking through thick woods, watching\n\nspring flowers in full bloom or waking up to a bulbul’s song in the\n\nmorning. Can we put a price tag on such things?\n\nThe ethical argument for conserving biodiversity relates to what we\n\nowe to millions of plant, animal and microbe species with whom we share\n\nthis planet. Philosophically or spiritually, we need to realise that every\n\nspecies has an intrinsic value, even if it may not be of current or any\n\neconomic value to us.  We have a moral duty to care for their well-being\n\nand pass on our biological legacy in good order to future generations.\n\n15.2.2 How do we conserve Biodiversity?\n\nWhen we conserve and protect the whole ecosystem, its biodiversity at all\n\nlevels is protected - we save the entire forest to save the tiger.  This approach\n\nis called in situ (on site) conservation. However, when there are situations\n\nwhere an animal or plant is endangered or threatened (organisms facing\n\na very high risk of extinction in the wild in the near future) and needs\n\nurgent measures to save it from extinction, ex situ (off site) conservation\n\nis the desirable approach.\n\nIn situ conservation– Faced with the conflict between development and\n\nconservation, many nations find it unrealistic and economically not feasible\n\nto conserve all their biological wealth. Invariably, the number of species\n\nwaiting to be saved from extinction far exceeds the conservation resources\n\navailable. On a global basis, this problem has been addressed by eminent\n\nconservationists. They identified for maximum protection certain\n\n‘biodiversity hotspots’ regions with very high levels of species richness\n\nand high degree of endemism (that is, species confined to that region\n\nand not found anywhere else).  Initially 25 biodiversity hotspots were\n\nidentified but subsequently nine more have been added to the list,\n\nbringing the total number of biodiversity hotspots in the world to 34.\n\nThese hotspots are also regions of accelerated habitat loss. Three of\n\nthese hotspots – Western Ghats and Sri Lanka, Indo-Burma and\n\nHimalaya – cover our country’s exceptionally high biodiversity regions.\n\nAlthough all the biodiversity hotspots put together cover less than\n\n2 per cent of the earth’s land area, the number of species they collectively\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n267\n\nBIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION\n\nharbour is extremely high and strict protection of these hotspots could\n\nreduce the ongoing mass extinctions by almost 30 per cent.\n\nIn India, ecologically unique and biodiversity-rich regions are legally\n\nprotected as biosphere reserves, national parks and sanctuaries.  India\n\nnow has 14 biosphere reserves, 90 national parks and 448 wildlife\n\nsanctuaries.  India has also a history of religious and cultural traditions\n\nthat emphasised protection of nature.  In many cultures, tracts of forest\n\nwere set aside, and all the trees and wildlife within were venerated and\n\ngiven total protection.  Such sacred groves are found in Khasi and Jaintia\n\nHills in Meghalaya, Aravalli Hills of Rajasthan, Western Ghat regions of\n\nKarnataka and Maharashtra and the Sarguja, Chanda and Bastar areas\n\nof Madhya Pradesh. In Meghalaya, the sacred groves are the last refuges\n\nfor a large number of rare and threatened plants.\n\nEx situ Conservation– In this approach, threatened animals and plants\n\nare taken out from their natural habitat and placed in special setting\n\nwhere they can be protected and given special care.  Zoological parks,\n\nbotanical gardens and wildlife safari parks serve this purpose. There are\n\nmany animals that have become extinct in the wild but continue to be\n\nmaintained in zoological parks.  In recent years ex situ conservation has\n\nadvanced beyond keeping threatened species in enclosures.  Now gametes\n\nof threatened species can be preserved in viable and fertile condition for\n\nlong periods using cryopreservation techniques, eggs can be fertilised in\n\nvitro, and plants can be propagated using tissue culture methods.  Seeds\n\nof different genetic strains of commercially important plants can be kept\n\nfor long periods in seed banks.\n\nBiodiversity knows no political boundaries and its conservation is\n\ntherefore a collective responsibility of all nations.  The historic Convention\n\non Biological Diversity (‘The Earth Summit’) held in Rio de Janeiro in\n\n1992, called upon all nations to take appropriate measures for\n\nconservation of biodiversity and sustainable utilisation of its benefits.  In\n\na follow-up, the World Summit on Sustainable Development held in 2002\n\nin Johannesburg, South Africa, 190 countries pledged their commitment\n\nto achieve by 2010, a significant reduction in the current rate of biodiversity\n\nloss at global, regional and local levels.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nSince life originated on earth nearly 3.8 billion years ago, there had\nbeen enormous diversification of life forms on earth. Biodiversity refers\nto the sum total of diversity that exists at all levels of biological\norganisation.  Of particular importance is the diversity at genetic, species\nand ecosystem levels and conservation efforts are aimed at protecting\ndiversity at all these levels.\n\nMore than 1.5 million species have been recorded in the world, but\nthere might still be nearly 6 million species on earth waiting to be\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n268\n\nBIOLOGY\n\ndiscovered and named.  Of the named species, > 70 per cent are animals,\nof which 70 per cent are insects.  The group Fungi has more species\nthan all the vertebrate species combined.  India, with about 45,000\nspecies of plants and twice as many species of animals, is one of the 12\nmega diversity countries of the world.\n\nSpecies diversity on earth is not uniformly distributed but shows\ninteresting patterns.  It is generally highest in the tropics and decreases\ntowards the poles. Important explanations for the species richness of\nthe tropics are: Tropics had more evolutionary time; they provide a\nrelatively constant environment and, they receive more solar energy\nwhich contributes to greater productivity. Species richness is also\nfunction of the area of a region; the species-area relationship is generally\na rectangular hyperbolic function.\n\nIt is believed that communities with high diversity tend to be less\nvariable, more productive and more resistant to biological invasions.\nEarth’s fossil history reveals incidence of mass extinctions in the past,\nbut the present rates of extinction, largely attributed to human activities,\nare 100 to 1000 times higher.  Nearly 700 species have become extinct\nin recent times and more than 15,500 species (of which > 650 are from\nIndia) currently face the threat of extinction.  The causes of high\nextinction rates at present include habitat (particularly forests) loss\nand fragmentation, over -exploitation, biological invasions and\nco-extinctions.\n\nEarth’s rich biodiversity is vital for the very survival of mankind.\nThe reasons for conserving biodiversity are narrowly utilitarian, broadly\nutilitarian and ethical.  Besides the direct benefits (food, fibre, firewood,\npharmaceuticals, etc.), there are many indirect benefits we receive\nthrough ecosystem services such as pollination, pest control, climate\nmoderation and flood control. We also have a moral responsibility to\ntake good care of earth’s biodiversity and pass it on in good order to our\nnext generation.\n\nBiodiversity conservation may be in situ as well as ex situ.  In in situ\nconservation, the endangered species are protected in their natural\nhabitat so that the entire ecosystem is protected. Recently, 34\n‘biodiversity hotspots’ in the world have been proposed for intensive\nconservation efforts. Of these, three (Western Ghats-Sri Lanka,\nHimalaya and Indo-Burma) cover India’s rich biodiversity regions. Our\ncountry’s in situ conservation efforts are reflected in its 14 biosphere\nreserves, 90 national parks, > 450 wildlife sanctuaries and many sacred\ngroves. Ex situ conservation methods include protective maintenance\nof threatened species in zoological parks and botanical gardens, in vitro\nfertilisation, tissue culture propagation and cryopreservation of\ngametes.\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1.
