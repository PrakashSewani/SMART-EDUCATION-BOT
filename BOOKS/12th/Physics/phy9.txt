Electromagnetic radiation belonging to this region of the\nspectrum (wavelength of about 400 nm to 750 nm) is called light. It is\nmainly through light and the sense of vision that we know and interpret\n\nthe world around us.\nThere are two things that we can intuitively mention about light from\n\ncommon experience. First, that it travels with enormous speed and second,\n\nthat it travels in a straight line. It took some time for people to realise that\n\nthe speed of light is finite and measurable. Its presently accepted value\nin vacuum is c = 2.99792458 × 108 m s–1.  For many purposes, it suffices\n\nto take c = 3 × 10\n8\n m s\n\n–1\n. The speed of light in vacuum is the highest\n\nspeed attainable in nature.\nThe intuitive notion that light travels in a straight line seems to\n\ncontradict what we have learnt in Chapter 8, that light is an\nelectromagnetic wave of wavelength belonging to the visible part of the\nspectrum. How to reconcile the two facts? The answer is that the\n\nwavelength of light is very small compared to the size of ordinary objects\nthat we encounter commonly (generally of the order of a few cm or larger).\nIn this situation, as you will learn in Chapter 10, a light wave can be\n\nconsidered to travel from one point to another, along a straight line joining\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n310\n\nthem. The path is called a ray of light, and a bundle of such rays\nconstitutes a beam of light.\n\nIn this chapter, we consider the phenomena of reflection, refraction\nand dispersion of light, using the ray picture of light. Using the basic\nlaws of reflection and refraction, we shall study the image formation by\nplane and spherical reflecting and refracting surfaces. We then go on to\ndescribe the construction and working of some important optical\ninstruments, including the human eye.\n\nPARTICLE MODEL OF LIGHT\n\nNewton’s fundamental contributions to mathematics, mechanics, and gravitation often blind\nus to his deep experimental and theoretical study of light. He made pioneering contributions\nin the field of optics. He further developed the corpuscular model of light proposed by\nDescartes. It presumes that light energy is concentrated in tiny particles called corpuscles.\nHe further assumed that corpuscles of light were massless elastic particles. With his\nunderstanding of mechanics, he could come up with a simple model of reflection and\nrefraction. It is a common observation that a ball bouncing from a smooth plane surface\nobeys the laws of reflection. When this is an elastic collision, the magnitude of the velocity\nremains the same. As the surface is smooth, there is no force acting parallel to the surface,\nso the component of momentum in this direction also remains the same. Only the component\nperpendicular to the surface, i.e., the normal component of the momentum, gets reversed\nin reflection. Newton argued that smooth surfaces like mirrors reflect the corpuscles in a\nsimilar manner.\n\nIn order to explain the phenomena of refraction, Newton postulated that the speed of\nthe corpuscles was greater in water or glass than in air. However, later on it was discovered\nthat the speed of light is less in water or glass than in air.\n\nIn the field of optics, Newton – the experimenter, was greater than Newton – the theorist.\nHe himself observed many phenomena, which were difficult to understand in terms of\nparticle nature of light. For example, the colours observed due to a thin film of oil on water.\nProperty of partial reflection of light is yet another such example. Everyone who has looked\ninto the water in a pond sees image of the face in it, but also sees the bottom of the pond.\nNewton argued that some of the corpuscles, which fall on the water, get reflected and some\nget transmitted. But what property could distinguish these two kinds of corpuscles? Newton\nhad to postulate some kind of unpredictable, chance phenomenon, which decided whether\nan individual corpuscle would be reflected or not. In explaining other phenomena, however,\nthe corpuscles were presumed to behave as if they are identical. Such a dilemma does not\noccur in the wave picture of light. An incoming wave can be divided into two weaker waves\nat the boundary between air and water.\n\n9.2  REFLECTION OF LIGHT BY SPHERICAL MIRRORS\nWe are familiar with the laws of reflection. The angle of reflection (i.e., the\n\nangle between reflected ray and the normal to the reflecting surface or\nthe mirror) equals the angle of incidence (angle between incident ray and\nthe normal). Also that the incident ray, reflected ray and the normal to\n\nthe reflecting surface at the point of incidence lie in the same plane\n(Fig. 9.1). These laws are valid at each point on any reflecting surface\nwhether plane or curved. However, we shall restrict our discussion to the\n\nspecial case of curved surfaces, that is, spherical surfaces. The normal in\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nRay Optics and\n\nOptical Instruments\n\n311\n\nthis case is to be taken as normal to the tangent\nto surface at the point of incidence. That is, the\nnormal is along the radius, the line joining the\n\ncentre of curvature of the mirror to the point of\nincidence.\n\nWe have already studied that the geometric\n\ncentre of a spherical mirror is called its pole while\nthat of a spherical lens is called its optical centre.\nThe line joining the pole and the centre of curvature\n\nof the spherical mirror is known as the principal\naxis. In the case of spherical lenses, the principal\naxis is the line joining the optical centre with its\n\nprincipal focus as you will see later.\n\n9.2.1  Sign convention\n\nTo derive the relevant formulae for reflection by spherical mirrors and\nrefraction by spherical lenses, we must first adopt a sign convention for\nmeasuring distances. In this book, we shall follow the Cartesian sign\n\nconvention. According to this\nconvention, all distances are measured\nfrom the pole of the mirror or the optical\n\ncentre of the lens. The distances\nmeasured in the same direction as the\nincident light are taken as positive and\n\nthose measured in the direction\nopposite to the direction of incident\nlight are taken as negative (Fig. 9.2).\n\nThe heights measured upwards with\nrespect to x-axis and normal to the\nprincipal axis (x-axis) of the mirror/\n\nlens are taken as positive (Fig. 9.2). The\nheights measured downwards are\ntaken as negative.\n\nWith a common accepted convention, it turns out that a single formula\nfor spherical mirrors and a single formula for spherical lenses can handle\nall different cases.\n\n9.2.2  Focal length of spherical mirrors\n\nFigure 9.3 shows what happens when a parallel beam of light is incident\n\non (a) a concave mirror, and (b) a convex mirror. We assume that the rays\n\nare paraxial, i.e., they are incident at points close to the pole P of the mirror\n\nand make small angles with the principal axis. The reflected rays converge\n\nat a point F on the principal axis of a concave mirror [Fig. 9.3(a)].\n\nFor a convex mirror, the reflected rays appear to diverge from a point F\n\non its principal axis [Fig. 9.3(b)]. The point F is called the principal focus\n\nof the mirror. If the parallel paraxial beam of light were incident, making\n\nsome angle with the principal axis, the reflected rays would converge (or\n\nappear to diverge) from a point in a plane through F normal to the principal\n\naxis. This is called the focal plane of the mirror [Fig. 9.3(c)].\n\nFIGURE 9.1 The incident ray, reflected ray\nand the normal to the reflecting surface lie\n\nin the same plane.\n\nFIGURE 9.2  The Cartesian Sign Convention.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n312\n\nThe distance between the focus F and the pole P of the mirror is called\nthe focal length of the mirror, denoted by f. We now show that f = R/2,\n\nwhere R is the radius of curvature of the mirror. The geometry\n\nof reflection of an incident ray is shown in Fig. 9.4.\nLet C be the centre of curvature of the mirror. Consider a\n\nray parallel to the principal axis striking the mirror at M. Then\n\nCM will be perpendicular to the mirror at M. Let θ be the angle\nof incidence, and MD be the perpendicular from M on the\nprincipal axis. Then,\n\n∠MCP = θ and ∠MFP = 2θ\nNow,\n\ntanθ =\nMD\n\nCD\n and tan 2θ = \n\nMD\n\nFD\n(9.1)\n\nFor small θ, which is true for paraxial rays, tanθ  ≈ θ,\ntan 2θ ≈ 2θ.  Therefore, Eq. (9.1) gives\n\nMD\n\nFD\n = 2 \n\nMD\n\nCD\n\nor, FD = \nCD\n\n2\n(9.2)\n\nNow, for small θ, the point D is very close to the point P.\nTherefore, FD = f and CD = R. Equation (9.2) then gives\n\nf = R/2 (9.3)\n\n9.2.3  The mirror equation\n\nIf rays emanating from a point actually meet at another point after\nreflection and/or refraction, that point is called the image of the first\n\npoint. The image is real if the rays actually converge to the point; it is\n\nFIGURE 9.3  Focus of a concave and convex mirror.\n\nFIGURE 9.4 Geometry of\n\nreflection of an incident ray on\n(a) concave spherical mirror,\n\nand (b) convex spherical mirror.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nRay Optics and\n\nOptical Instruments\n\n313\n\nvirtual if the rays do not actually meet but appear\nto diverge from the point when produced\nbackwards. An image is thus a point-to-point\n\ncorrespondence with the object established\nthrough reflection and/or refraction.\n\nIn principle, we can take any two rays\n\nemanating from a point on an object, trace their\npaths, find their point of intersection and thus,\nobtain the image of the point due to reflection at a\n\nspherical mirror. In practice, however, it is\nconvenient to choose any two of the following rays:\n(i) The ray from the point which is parallel to the\n\nprincipal axis. The reflected ray goes through\nthe focus of the mirror.\n\n(ii) The ray passing through the centre of\n\ncurvature of a concave mirror or appearing to pass through it for a\nconvex mirror. The reflected ray simply retraces the path.\n\n(iii) The ray passing through (or directed towards) the focus of the concave\n\nmirror or appearing to pass through (or directed towards) the focus\nof a convex mirror. The reflected ray is parallel to the principal axis.\n\n(iv) The ray incident at any angle at the pole. The reflected ray follows\n\nlaws of reflection.\nFigure 9.5 shows the ray diagram considering three rays. It shows\n\nthe image A′B′ (in this case, real) of an object AB formed by a concave\nmirror. It does not mean that only three rays emanate from the point A.\nAn infinite number of rays emanate from any source, in all directions.\nThus, point A′ is image point of A if every ray originating at point A and\nfalling on the concave mirror after reflection passes through the point A′.\n\nWe now derive the mirror equation or the relation between the object\ndistance (u), image distance (v) and the focal length ( f ).\n\nFrom Fig. 9.5, the two right-angled triangles A′B′F and MPF are\nsimilar. (For paraxial rays, MP can be considered to be a straight line\nperpendicular to CP.) Therefore,\n\nB A B F\n\nPM FP\n\n′ ′ ′\n=\n\nor \nB A B F\n\nBA FP\n\n′ ′ ′\n=  (∵PM = AB) (9.4)\n\nSince ∠ APB = ∠ A′PB′, the right angled triangles A′B′P and ABP are\nalso similar. Therefore,\n\nB A B P\n\nB A B P\n\n′ ′ ′\n= (9.5)\n\nComparing Eqs. (9.4) and (9.5), we get\n\nB P – FPB F B P\n\nFP FP BP\n\n′′ ′\n= = (9.6)\n\nEquation (9.6) is a relation involving magnitude of distances. We now\napply the sign convention. We note that light travels from the object to\n\nthe mirror MPN. Hence this is taken as the positive direction. To reach\n\nFIGURE 9.5 Ray diagram for image\nformation by a concave mirror.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n314\n\nthe object AB, image A′B′ as well as the focus F from the pole P, we have\nto travel opposite to the direction of incident light. Hence, all the three\nwill have negative signs. Thus,\n\nB′ P = –v, FP = –f, BP = –u\nUsing these in Eq. (9.6), we get\n\n– –\n\n–\n\nv f v\n\nf u\n\n+\n=\n\n–\n\nor\n–v f v\n\nf u\n=\n\n      \nv\n\nf\n\nv\n\nu\n= +1\n\nDividing it by v, we get\n\n      \n\n1 1 1\n\nv u f\n+ =\n\n(9.7)\n\nThis relation is known as the mirror equation.\nThe size of the image relative to the size of the object is another\n\nimportant quantity to consider. We define linear magnification (m) as the\nratio of the height of the image (h′) to the height of the object (h):\n\nm = \nh\n\nh\n\n′\n(9.8)\n\nh and h′ will be taken positive or negative in accordance with the accepted\nsign convention. In triangles A′B′P and ABP, we have,\n\nB A B P\n\nBA BP\n\n′ ′ ′\n=\n\nWith the sign convention, this becomes\n\n– –h v\n\nh u\n\n′\n=\n\n–\n\nso that\n\nm = –\nh v\n\nh u\n\n′\n= (9.9)\n\nWe have derived here the mirror equation, Eq. (9.7), and the\nmagnification formula, Eq. (9.9), for the case of real, inverted image formed\nby a concave mirror. With the proper use of sign convention, these are,\nin fact, valid for all the cases of reflection by a spherical mirror (concave\nor convex) whether the image formed is real or virtual. Figure 9.6 shows\nthe ray diagrams for virtual image formed by a concave and convex mirror.\nYou should verify that Eqs. (9.7) and (9.9) are valid for these cases as\nwell.\n\nFIGURE 9.6  Image formation by (a) a concave mirror with object between\nP and F, and (b) a convex mirror.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nRay Optics and\n\nOptical Instruments\n\n315\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 9\n\n.3\n E\n\nX\nA\n\nM\nP\nL\nE\n 9\n\n.2\n E\n\nX\nA\n\nM\nP\nL\nE\n 9\n\n.1\n\nExample 9.1 Suppose that the lower half of the concave mirror’s\nreflecting surface in Fig. 9.5 is covered with an opaque (non-reflective)\n\nmaterial. What effect will this have on the image of an object placed\nin front of the mirror?\n\nSolution You may think that the image will now show only half of the\n\nobject, but taking the laws of reflection to be true for all points of the\nremaining part of the mirror, the image will be that of the whole object.\nHowever, as the area of the reflecting surface has been reduced, the\n\nintensity of the image will be low (in this case, half).\n\nExample 9.2 A mobile phone lies along the principal axis of a concave\n\nmirror, as shown in Fig. 9.7. Show by suitable diagram, the formation\nof its image. Explain why the magnification is not uniform. Will the\ndistortion of image depend on the location of the phone with respect\n\nto the mirror?\n\nFIGURE 9.7\n\nSolution\n\nThe ray diagram for the formation of the image of the phone is shown\nin Fig. 9.7. The image of the part which is on the plane perpendicular\nto principal axis will be on the same plane. It will be of the same size,\n\ni.e., B′C = BC. You can yourself realise why the image is distorted.\n\nExample 9.3 An object is placed at (i) 10 cm, (ii) 5 cm in front of a\nconcave mirror of radius of curvature 15 cm.

If\nthe jogger is running at a speed of 5 m s\n\n–1\n, how fast the image of the\n\njogger appear to move when the jogger is (a) 39 m, (b) 29 m, (c) 19 m,\n\nand (d) 9 m away.\n\nSolution\nFrom the mirror equation, Eq.

This phenomenon can be noticed by any person\n\nsitting in a stationary car or a bus. In case of moving vehicles, a\nsimilar phenomenon could be observed if the vehicle in the rear is\n\nmoving closer with a constant speed.\n\n9.3  REFRACTION\nWhen a beam of light encounters another transparent medium, a part of\nlight gets reflected back into the first medium while the rest enters the\nother. A ray of light represents a beam. The direction of propagation of an\n\nobliquely incident (0°< i < 90°) ray of light that enters the other medium,\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nRay Optics and\n\nOptical Instruments\n\n317\n\nchanges at the interface of the two media. This\n\nphenomenon is called refraction of light. Snell\n\nexperimentally obtained the following laws of\n\nrefraction:\n\n(i) The incident ray, the refracted ray and the\n\nnormal to the interface at the point of\n\nincidence, all lie in the same plane.\n\n(ii) The ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence\n\nto the sine of angle of refraction is constant.\n\nRemember that the angles of incidence (i ) and\n\nrefraction (r ) are the angles that the incident\n\nand  its refracted ray make with the normal,\n\nrespectively. We have\n\n21\n\nsin\n\nsin\n\ni\nn\n\nr\n= (9.10)\n\nwhere n\n21\n\n is a constant, called the refractive index of the second medium\n\nwith respect to the first medium. Equation (9.10) is the well-known Snell’s\nlaw of refraction. We note that n\n\n21\n is a characteristic of the pair of media\n\n(and also depends on the wavelength of light), but is independent of the\n\nangle of incidence.\nFrom Eq. (9.10), if n\n\n21\n > 1, r < i , i.e., the refracted ray bends towards\n\nthe normal. In such a case medium 2 is said to be optically denser (or\ndenser, in short) than medium 1. On the other hand, if n\n\n21\n <1, r > i, the\n\nrefracted ray bends away from the normal. This is the case when incident\n\nray in a denser medium refracts into a rarer medium.\n\nNote: Optical density should not be confused with mass density,\nwhich is mass per unit volume. It is possible that mass density of\n\nan optically denser medium may be less than that of an optically\n\nrarer medium (optical density is the ratio of the speed of light in\n\ntwo media). For example, turpentine and water. Mass density of\n\nturpentine is less than that of water but its optical density is higher.\n\nIf n\n21\n\n is the refractive index of medium 2\n\nwith respect to medium 1 and n\n12\n\n the refractive\n\nindex of medium 1 with respect to medium 2,\n\nthen it should be clear that\n\n12\n\n21\n\n1\nn\n\nn\n= (9.11)\n\nIt also follows that if n\n32\n\n is the refractive\n\nindex of medium 3 with respect to medium 2\nthen \n\n \nn\n\n32\n = n\n\n31\n ×  n\n\n12\n, where  n\n\n31\n is the refractive\n\nindex  of medium 3 with respect to medium 1.\n\nSome elementary results based on the laws\nof refraction follow immediately. For a\nrectangular slab, refraction takes place at two\n\ninterfaces (air-glass and glass-air). It is easily seen from Fig. 9.9 that\nr\n2\n = i\n\n1\n, i.e., the emergent ray is parallel to the incident ray—there is no\n\nFIGURE 9.8 Refraction and reflection of light.\n\nFIGURE 9.9  Lateral shift of a ray refracted\n\nthrough a parallel-sided slab.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n318  \nE\n\nX\nA\n\nM\nP\nL\nE\n 9\n\n.5\n\ndeviation, but it does suffer lateral displacement/\nshift with respect to the incident ray. Another familiar\nobservation is that the bottom of a tank filled with\n\nwater appears to be raised (Fig. 9.10). For viewing\nnear the normal direction, it can be shown that the\napparent depth (h\n\n1\n) is real depth (h\n\n2\n) divided by\n\nthe refractive index of the medium (water).\nThe refraction of light through the atmosphere\n\nis responsible for many interesting phenomena. For\n\nexample, the Sun is visible a little before the actual\nsunrise and until a little after the actual sunset\ndue to refraction of light through the atmosphere\n\n(Fig. 9.11). By actual sunrise we mean the actual\ncrossing of the horizon by the sun. Figure 9.11\nshows the actual and apparent positions of the Sun\n\nwith respect to the horizon. The figure is highly\nexaggerated to show the effect. The refractive index\nof air with respect to vacuum is 1.00029. Due to\n\nthis, the apparent shift in the direction of the Sun\nis by about half a degree and the corresponding\ntime difference between actual sunset and apparent\n\nsunset is about 2 minutes (see Example 9.5). The\napparent flattening (oval shape) of the Sun at sunset\nand sunrise is also due to the same phenomenon.\n\nFIGURE 9.10  Apparent depth for\n(a) normal, and (b) oblique viewing.\n\nFIGURE 9.11 Advance sunrise and delayed sunset due to\natmospheric refraction.\n\nExample 9.5 The earth takes 24 h to rotate once about its axis. How\nmuch time does the sun take to shift by 1° when viewed from\nthe earth?\n\nSolution\nTime taken for 360° shift = 24 h\n\nTime taken for 1° shift = 24/360 h = 4 min.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nRay Optics and\n\nOptical Instruments\n\n319\n\n9.4  TOTAL INTERNAL REFLECTION\nWhen light travels from an optically denser medium to a rarer medium\nat the interface, it is partly reflected back into the same medium and\npartly refracted to the second medium. This reflection is called the internal\n\nreflection.\n\nWhen a ray of light enters from a denser medium to a rarer medium,\nit bends away from the normal, for example, the ray AO\n\n1 \nB in Fig. 9.12.\n\nThe incident ray AO\n1\n is partially reflected (O\n\n1\nC) and partially transmitted\n\n(O\n1\nB) or refracted, the angle of refraction (r ) being larger than the angle of\n\nincidence (i ). As the angle of incidence increases, so does the angle of\n\nrefraction, till for the ray AO\n3\n, the angle of refraction is π/2. The refracted\n\nray is bent so much away from the normal that it grazes the surface at\nthe interface between the two media. This is shown by the ray AO\n\n3 \nD in\n\nFig. 9.12. If the angle of incidence is increased still further (e.g., the ray\nAO\n\n4\n), refraction is not possible, and the incident ray is totally reflected.\n\nTHE DROWNING CHILD, LIFEGUARD AND SNELL’S LAW\n\nConsider a rectangular swimming pool PQSR; see figure here. A lifeguard sitting at G\n\noutside the pool notices a child drowning at a point C. The guard wants to reach the\nchild in the shortest possible time. Let SR be the\nside of the pool between G and C. Should he/she\n\ntake a straight line path GAC between G and C or\nGBC in which the path BC in water would be the\nshortest, or some other path GXC? The guard knows\n\nthat his/her running speed v\n1\n on ground is higher\n\nthan his/her swimming speed v\n2\n.\n\nSuppose the guard enters water at X. Let GX =l\n1\n\nand XC =l\n2\n. Then the time taken to reach from G to\n\nC would be\n\n1 2\n\n1 2\n\nl l\nt\n\nv v\n= +\n\nTo make this time minimum, one has to\ndifferentiate it (with respect to the coordinate of X ) and find the point X when t is a\nminimum. On doing all this algebra (which we skip here), we find that the guard should\n\nenter water at a point where Snell’s law is satisfied. To understand this, draw a\nperpendicular LM to side SR at X. Let ∠GXM = i and ∠CXL = r. Then it can be seen that t\nis minimum when\n\n1\n\n2\n\nsin\n\nsin\n\nvi\n\nr v\n=\n\nIn the case of light v\n1\n/v\n\n2\n, the ratio of the velocity of light in vacuum to that in the\n\nmedium, is the refractive index n of the medium.\n\nIn short, whether it is a wave or a particle or a human being, whenever two mediums\nand two velocities are involved, one must follow Snell’s law if one wants to take the\nshortest time.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n320\n\nThis is called total internal reflection. When\nlight gets reflected by a surface, normally\nsome fraction of it gets transmitted. The\n\nreflected ray, therefore, is always less intense\nthan the incident ray, howsoever smooth the\nreflecting surface may be. In total internal\n\nreflection, on the other hand, no\ntransmission of light takes place.\n\nThe angle of incidence corresponding to\n\nan angle of refraction 90°, say ∠AO\n3\nN, is\n\ncalled the critical angle (i\nc\n ) for the given pair\n\nof media.   We see from Snell’s law [Eq. (9.10)]\n\nthat if the relative refractive index of the\nrefracting medium is less than one then,\nsince the maximum value of sin r is unity,\n\nthere is an upper limit to the value of sin i for which the law can be\nsatisfied, that is, i = i\n\nc\n such that\n\nsin i\nc\n  = n\n\n21\n(9.12)\n\nFor values of i larger than i\nc\n, Snell’s law of refraction cannot be\n\nsatisfied, and hence no refraction is possible.\nThe refractive index of denser medium 1 with respect to rarer medium\n\n2 will be n\n12\n\n = 1/sin i\nc\n. Some typical critical angles are listed in Table 9.1.\n\nFIGURE 9.12   Refraction and internal reflection\n\nof rays from a point A in the denser medium\n(water) incident at different angles at the interface\n\nwith a rarer medium (air).\n\nA demonstration for total internal reflection\n\nAll optical phenomena can be demonstrated very easily with the use of a\n\nlaser torch or pointer, which is easily available nowadays. Take a glass\nbeaker with clear water in it. Add a few drops of milk or any other\nsuspension to water and stir so that water becomes a little turbid. Take\n\na laser pointer and shine its beam through the turbid water. You will\nfind that the path of the beam inside the water shines brightly.\n\nShine the beam from below the beaker such that it strikes at the\n\nupper water surface at the other end. Do you find that it undergoes partial\nreflection (which is seen as a spot on the table below) and partial refraction\n[which comes out in the air and is seen as a spot on the roof; Fig. 9.13(a)]?\n\nNow direct the laser beam from one side of the beaker such that it strikes\nthe upper surface of water more obliquely [Fig. 9.13(b)]. Adjust the\ndirection of laser beam until you find the angle for which the refraction\n\nTABLE 9.1 CRITICAL ANGLE OF SOME TRANSPARENT MEDIA WITH RESPECT TO AIR\n\nSubstance medium Refractive index Critical angle\n\nWater 1.33 48.75\n\nCrown glass 1.52 41.14\n\nDense flint glass 1.62 37.31\n\nDiamond 2.42 24.41\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nRay Optics and\n\nOptical Instruments\n\n321\n\nabove the water surface is totally absent and the beam is totally reflected\nback to water. This is total internal reflection at its simplest.\n\nPour this water in a long test tube and shine the laser light from top,\n\nas shown in Fig. 9.13(c). Adjust the direction of the laser beam such that\nit is totally internally reflected every time it strikes the walls of the tube.\nThis is similar to what happens in optical fibres.\n\nTake care not to look into the laser beam directly and not to point it\nat anybody’s face.\n\n9.4.1 Total internal reflection in nature and\nits technological applications\n\n(i) Mirage: On hot summer days, the air near the ground becomes hotter\nthan the air at higher levels. The refractive index of air increases with\n\nits density. Hotter air is less dense, and has smaller refractive index\nthan the cooler air. If the air currents are small, that is, the air is still,\nthe optical density at different layers of air increases with height. As a\n\nresult, light from  a tall object such as a tree, passes through a medium\nwhose refractive index decreases towards the ground. Thus, a ray of\nlight from such an object successively bends away from the normal\n\nand undergoes total internal reflection, if the angle of incidence for\nthe air near the ground exceeds the critical angle. This is shown in\nFig. 9.14(b). To a distant observer, the light appears to be coming\nfrom somewhere below the ground. The observer naturally assumes\n\nthat light is being reflected from the ground, say, by a pool of water\nnear the tall object. Such inverted images of distant tall objects cause\nan optical illusion to the observer. This phenomenon is called mirage.\n\nThis type of mirage is especially common in hot deserts. Some of you\nmight have noticed that while moving in a bus or a car during a hot\nsummer day, a distant patch of road, especially on a highway, appears\n\nto be wet. But, you do not find any evidence of wetness when you\nreach that spot. This is also due to mirage.\n\nFIGURE 9.13\nObserving total\n\ninternal reflection in\n\nwater with a laser\nbeam (refraction due\n\nto glass of beaker\n\nneglected being very\nthin).\n\nFIGURE 9.14 (a) A tree is seen by an observer at its place when the air above the ground is\nat uniform temperature,  (b) When the layers of air close to the ground have varying\n\ntemperature with hottest layers near the ground, light from a distant tree may\n\nundergo total internal reflection, and the apparent image of the tree may create\nan illusion to the observer that the tree is near a pool of water.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n322\n\n(ii) Diamond: Diamonds are known for their\nspectacular brilliance.  Their brilliance\nis mainly due to the total internal\n\nreflection of light inside them. The critical\nangle for diamond-air interface (≅ 24.4°)\nis very small, therefore once light enters\n\na diamond, it is very likely to undergo\ntotal internal reflection inside it.\nDiamonds found in nature rarely exhibit\n\nthe brilliance for which they are known.\nIt is the technical skill of a diamond\ncutter which makes diamonds to\n\nsparkle so brilliantly.  By cutting the\ndiamond suitably, multiple total\ninternal reflections can be made\n\nto occur.\n(iii)Prism : Prisms designed to bend light by\n\n90° or by 180° make use of total internal\n\nreflection [Fig. 9.15(a) and (b)]. Such a\nprism is also used to invert images\nwithout changing their size [Fig. 9.15(c)].\n\nIn the first two cases, the critical angle i\nc\n for the material of the prism\n\nmust be less than 45°. We see from Table 9.1 that this is true for both\ncrown glass and dense flint glass.\n(iv) Optical fibres: Nowadays optical fibres are extensively used for\n\ntransmitting audio and video signals through long distances. Optical\nfibres too make use of the phenomenon of total internal reflection.\nOptical fibres are fabricated with high quality composite glass/quartz\n\nfibres. Each fibre consists of a core and cladding. The refractive index\nof the material of the core is higher than that of the cladding.\n\nWhen a signal in the form of light is\n\ndirected at one end of the fibre at a suitable\n\nangle, it undergoes repeated total internal\n\nreflections along the length of the fibre and\n\nfinally comes out at the other end (Fig. 9.16).\n\nSince light undergoes total internal reflection\n\nat each stage, there is no appreciable loss in\n\nthe intensity of the light signal. Optical fibres\n\nare fabricated such that light reflected at one\n\nside of inner surface strikes the other at an\n\nangle larger than the critical angle. Even if the\n\nfibre is bent, light can easily travel along its\n\nlength. Thus, an optical fibre can be used to act as an optical pipe.\n\nA bundle of optical fibres can be put to several uses. Optical fibres\n\nare extensively used for transmitting and receiving electrical signals which\n\nare converted to light by suitable transducers. Obviously, optical fibres\n\ncan also be used for transmission of optical signals. For example, these\n\nare used as a ‘light pipe’ to facilitate visual examination of internal organs\n\nlike esophagus, stomach and intestines. You might have seen a commonly\n\nFIGURE 9.15 Prisms designed to bend rays by\n\n90° and 180° or to invert image without changing\nits size make use of total internal reflection.\n\nFIGURE 9.16 Light undergoes successive total\ninternal reflections as it moves through an\n\noptical fibre.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nRay Optics and\n\nOptical Instruments\n\n323\n\navailable decorative lamp with fine plastic fibres with their free ends\nforming a fountain like structure. The other end of the fibres is fixed over\nan electric lamp. When the lamp is switched on, the light travels from the\n\nbottom of each fibre and appears at the tip of its free end as a dot of light.\nThe fibres in such decorative lamps are optical fibres.\n\nThe main requirement in fabricating optical fibres is that there should\n\nbe very little absorption of light as it travels for long distances inside\nthem. This has been achieved by purification and special preparation of\nmaterials such as quartz. In silica glass fibres, it is possible to transmit\n\nmore than 95% of the light over a fibre length of 1 km. (Compare with\nwhat you expect for a block of ordinary window glass 1 km thick.)\n\n9.5 REFRACTION AT SPHERICAL SURFACES\nAND BY LENSES\n\nWe have so far considered refraction at a plane interface. We shall now\n\nconsider refraction at a spherical interface between two transparent media.\n\nAn infinitesimal part of a spherical surface can be regarded as planar\n\nand the same laws of refraction can be applied at every point on the\n\nsurface. Just as for reflection by a spherical mirror, the normal at the\n\npoint of incidence is perpendicular to the tangent plane to the spherical\n\nsurface at that point and, therefore, passes through its centre of curvature.\n\nWe first consider refraction by a single spherical surface and follow it by\n\nthin lenses. A thin lens is a transparent optical medium bounded by two\n\nsurfaces; at least one of which should be spherical. Applying the formula\n\nfor image formation by a single spherical surface successively at the two\n\nsurfaces of a lens, we shall obtain the lens maker’s formula and then the\n\nlens formula.\n\n9.5.1  Refraction at a spherical surface\n\nFigure 9.17 shows the geometry of formation of image I of an object O on\nthe principal axis of a spherical surface with centre of curvature C, and\n\nradius of curvature R. The rays are incident from a medium of refractive\nindex n\n\n1\n, to another of refractive index n\n\n2\n. As before, we take the aperture\n\n(or the lateral size) of the surface to be small\n\ncompared to other distances involved, so that small\nangle approximation can be made. In particular,\nNM will be taken to be nearly equal to the length of\n\nthe perpendicular from the point N on the principal\naxis. We have, for small angles,\n\ntan ∠NOM = \nMN\n\nOM\n\ntan ∠NCM = \nMN\n\nMC\n\ntan ∠NIM  = \nMN\n\nMI\n\nFIGURE 9.17  Refraction at a spherical\n\nsurface separating two media.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n324\n\nNow, for ∆NOC, i is the exterior angle. Therefore, i = ∠NOM + ∠NCM\n\ni = \nMN MN\n\nOM MC\n+ (9.13)\n\nSimilarly,\n\nr = ∠NCM – ∠NIM\n\ni.e., r = \nMN MN\n\nMC MI\n− (9.14)\n\nNow, by Snell’s law\n\nn\n1\n sin i = n\n\n2\n sin r\n\nor for small angles\n\nn\n1\ni = n\n\n2\nr\n\nLIGHT SOURCES AND PHOTOMETRY\n\nIt is known that a body above absolute zero temperature emits electromagnetic radiation.\nThe wavelength region in which the body emits the radiation depends on its absolute\n\ntemperature. Radiation emitted by a hot body, for example, a tungsten filament lamp\nhaving temperature 2850 K are partly invisible and mostly in infrared (or heat) region.\nAs the temperature of the body increases radiation emitted by it is in visible region. The\n\nsun with temperature of about 5500 K emits radiation whose energy versus wavelength\ngraph peaks approximately at 550 nm corresponding to green light and is almost in the\nmiddle of the visible region. The energy versus wavelength distribution graph for a given\n\nbody peaks at some wavelength, which is inversely proportional to the absolute\ntemperature of that body.\n\nThe measurement of light as perceived by human eye is called photometry. Photometry\n\nis measurement of a physiological phenomenon, being the stimulus of light as received\nby the human eye, transmitted by the optic nerves and analysed by the brain. The main\nphysical quantities in photometry are (i) the luminous intensity of the source,\n\n(ii) the luminous flux or flow of light from the source, and (iii) illuminance of the surface.\nThe SI unit of luminous intensity (I ) is candela (cd). The candela is the luminous intensity,\nin a given direction, of a source that emits monochromatic radiation of frequency\n\n540 × 10\n12\n\n Hz and that has a radiant intensity in that direction of 1/683 watt per steradian.\nIf a light source emits one candela of luminous intensity into a solid angle of one steradian,\nthe total luminous flux emitted into that solid angle is one lumen (lm). A standard\n\n100 watt incadescent light bulb emits approximately 1700 lumens.\nIn photometry, the only parameter, which can be measured directly is illuminance. It\n\nis defined as luminous flux incident per unit area on a surface (lm/m2 or lux ). Most light\n\nmeters measure this quantity. The illuminance E, produced by a source of luminous\nintensity I, is given by E = I/r\n\n2\n, where r is the normal distance of the surface from the\n\nsource. A quantity named luminance (L), is used to characterise the brightness of emitting\n\nor reflecting flat surfaces. Its unit is cd/m\n2 \n(sometimes called ‘nit’ in industry). A good\n\nLCD computer monitor has a brightness of about 250 nits.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nRay Optics and\n\nOptical Instruments\n\n325\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 9\n\n.6\n\nSubstituting i and r from Eqs.

(9.15), we get\n\n2 1 2 1n n n n\n\nv u R\n\n−\n− = (9.16)\n\nEquation (9.16) gives us a relation between object and image distance\n\nin terms of refractive index of the medium and the radius of\ncurvature of the curved spherical surface. It holds for any curved\nspherical surface.\n\nExample 9.6 Light from a point source in air falls on a spherical\nglass surface (n = 1.5 and radius of curvature = 20 cm). The distance\nof the light source from the glass surface is 100 cm. At what position\n\nthe image is formed?\n\nSolution\nWe use the relation given by Eq. (9.16). Here\n\nu = – 100 cm, v = ?, R = + 20 cm, n\n1\n = 1, and n\n\n2\n = 1.5.\n\nWe then have\n\n1.5 1 0.5\n\n100 20v\n+ =\n\nor   v = +100 cm\n\nThe image is formed at a distance of 100 cm from the glass surface,\n\nin the direction of incident light.\n\n9.5.2  Refraction by a lens\n\nFigure 9.18(a) shows the geometry of image formation by a double convex\nlens. The image formation can be seen in terms of two steps:\n\n(i) The first refracting surface forms the image I\n1\n of the object O\n\n[Fig. 9.18(b)]. The image I\n1\n acts as a virtual object for the second surface\n\nthat forms the image at I [Fig. 9.18(c)]. Applying Eq.

A lens has two foci, F and\n\nF′, on either side of it (Fig. 9.19). By the\nsign convention,\n\nBC\n1\n = + R\n\n1\n,\n\nDC\n2\n = –R\n\n2\n\nSo Eq. (9.20) can be written as\n\n( ) 221 21\n1 2 1\n\n1 1 1\n1\n\nn\nn n\n\nf R R n\n\n\uf8eb \uf8f6 \uf8eb \uf8f6\n= − − =\uf8ec \uf8f7 \uf8ec \uf8f7\uf8ed \uf8f8 \uf8ed \uf8f8\n\n∵ (9.21)\n\nEquation (9.21) is known as the lens\nmaker’s formula. It is useful to design\n\nlenses of desired focal length using surfaces\nof suitable radii of curvature. Note that the\nformula is true for a concave lens also. In\n\nthat case R\n1\nis negative, R\n\n2\n positive and\n\ntherefore, f is negative.\nFrom Eqs. (9.19) and (9.20), we get\n\n1 1 1\n\nOB DI\n\nn n n\n\nf\n+ = (9.22)\n\nAgain, in the thin lens approximation, B and D are both close to the\noptical centre of the lens. Applying the sign convention,\n\nBO = – u, DI = +v, we get\n\n1 1 1\n\nv u f\n− = (9.23)\n\nEquation (9.23) is the familiar thin lens formula. Though we derived\nit for a real image formed by a convex lens, the formula is valid for both\nconvex as well as concave lenses and for both real and virtual images.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the two foci, F and F′, of a double convex\nor concave lens are equidistant from the optical centre. The focus on the\nside of the (original) source of light is called the first focal point, whereas\n\nthe other is called the second focal point.\nTo find the image of an object by a lens, we can, in principle, take any\n\ntwo rays emanating from a point on an object; trace their paths using\n\nFIGURE 9.18  (a) The position of object, and the\nimage formed by a double convex lens,\n\n(b) Refraction at the first spherical surface and\n\n(c) Refraction at the second spherical surface.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nRay Optics and\n\nOptical Instruments\n\n327\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 9\n\n.7\n\nthe laws of refraction and find the point where\nthe refracted rays meet (or appear to meet). In\npractice, however, it is convenient to choose any\n\ntwo of the following rays:\n(i) A ray emanating from the object parallel to\n\nthe principal axis of the lens after refraction\n\npasses through the second principal focus\nF′ (in a convex lens) or appears to diverge (in\na concave lens) from the first principal focus F.\n\n(ii) A ray of light, passing through the optical\ncentre of the lens, emerges without any\ndeviation after refraction.\n\n(iii) (a) A ray of light passing through the first\nprincipal focus of a convex lens [Fig. 9.19(a)]\nemerges parallel to the principal axis after\n\nrefraction.\n(b) A ray of light incident on a concave lens\nappearing to meet the principal axis at\n\nsecond focus point emerges parallel to the\nprincipal axis after refraction [Fig. 9.19(b)].\nFigures 9.19(a) and (b) illustrate these rules\n\nfor a convex and a concave  lens, respectively.\nYou should practice drawing similar ray diagrams for different positions\nof the object with respect to the lens and also verify that the lens formula,\n\nEq. (9.23), holds good for all cases.\nHere again it must be remembered that each point on an object gives\n\nout infinite number of rays. All these rays will pass through the same\n\nimage point after refraction at the lens.\nMagnification (m ) produced by a lens is defined, like that for a mirror,\n\nas the ratio of the size of the image to that of the object. Proceeding in the\n\nsame way as for spherical mirrors, it is easily seen that for a lens\n\nm = \nh\n\nh\n\n′\n =  \n\nv\n\nu\n(9.24)\n\nWhen we apply the sign convention, we see that, for erect (and virtual)\n\nimage formed by a convex or concave lens, m is positive, while for an\ninverted (and real) image, m is negative.\n\nExample 9.7 A magician during a show makes a glass lens with\nn = 1.47 disappear in a trough of liquid.  What is the refractive index\n\nof the liquid? Could the liquid be water?\n\nSolution\nThe refractive index of the liquid must be equal to 1.47 in order to\n\nmake the lens disappear. This means n\n1\n = n\n\n2\n. This gives 1/f  =0 or\n\nf → ∞. The lens in the liquid will act like a plane sheet of glass. No,\nthe liquid is not water. It could be glycerine.\n\n9.5.3  Power of a lens\nPower of a lens is a measure of the convergence or divergence, which a\n\nlens introduces in the light falling on it.

The power P of a lens is defined as the\n\ntangent of the angle by which it converges or diverges a\nbeam of light parallel to the principal axis falling at unit\ndistance from the optical centre (Fig. 9.20).\n\ntan ; , tanδ δ= = =\nh\n\nf\nh\n\nf\nif 1\n\n1\n or \n\n1\n\nf\nδ =  for small\n\nvalue of δ. Thus,\n\nP = \n1\n\nf\n(9.25)\n\nThe SI unit for power of a lens is dioptre (D): 1D = 1m\n–1\n\n. The power of\na lens of focal length of 1 metre is one dioptre. Power of a lens is positive\n\nfor a converging lens and negative for a diverging lens. Thus, when an\noptician prescribes a corrective lens of power + 2.5 D, the required lens is\na convex lens of focal length + 40 cm. A lens of power of – 4.0 D means a\n\nconcave lens of focal length – 25 cm.\n\nExample 9.8 (i) If f = 0.5 m for a glass lens, what is the power of the\nlens? (ii) The radii of curvature of the faces of a double convex lens\n\nare 10 cm and 15 cm. Its focal length is 12 cm. What is the refractive\nindex of glass? (iii) A convex lens has 20 cm focal length in air. What\nis focal length in water? (Refractive index of air-water = 1.33, refractive\n\nindex for air-glass = 1.5.)\n\nSolution\n(i) Power = +2 dioptre.\n\n(ii) Here, we have f = +12 cm, R\n1\n = +10 cm, R\n\n2\n = –15 cm.\n\nRefractive index of air is taken as unity.\nWe use the lens formula of Eq. (9.22). The sign convention has to\n\nbe applied for f,  R\n1\n and R\n\n2\n.\n\nSubstituting the values, we have\n\n1\n\n12\n1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n1\n\n15\n= − −\n\n−\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n( )n\n\nThis gives n = 1.5.\n\n(iii) For a glass lens in air, n\n2\n = 1.5, n\n\n1\n = 1, f = +20 cm. Hence, the lens\n\nformula gives\n\n1\n\n20\n0 5\n\n1 1\n\n1 2\n\n= −\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ef\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8fb\n\uf8fa.\n\nR R\n\nFor the same glass lens in water, n\n2\n = 1.5, n\n\n1\n = 1.33.

Let the object be placed at a point O beyond the focus of\n\nFIGURE 9.20 Power of a lens.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nRay Optics and\n\nOptical Instruments\n\n329\n\nthe first lens A (Fig. 9.21). The first lens produces\nan image at I\n\n1\n. Since image I\n\n1\n is real, it serves as a\n\nvirtual object for the second lens B, producing the\n\nfinal image at I. It must, however, be borne in mind\nthat formation of image by the first lens is presumed\nonly to facilitate determination of the position of the\n\nfinal image. In fact, the direction of rays emerging\nfrom the first lens gets modified in accordance with\nthe angle at which they strike the second lens. Since\n\nthe lenses are thin, we assume the optical centres of the lenses to be\ncoincident. Let this central point be denoted by P.\n\nFor the image formed by the first lens A, we get\n\n1 1\n\n1 1 1\n\nv u f\n− = (9.27)\n\nFor the image formed by the second lens B, we get\n\n1 2\n\n1 1 1\n\nv v f\n− = (9.28)\n\nAdding Eqs. (9.27) and (9.28), we get\n\n1 2\n\n1 1 1 1\n\nv u f f\n− = + (9.29)\n\nIf the two lens-system is regarded as equivalent to a single lens of\nfocal length f, we have\n\n1 1 1\n\nv u f\n− =\n\nso that we get\n\n1 2\n\n1 1 1\n\nf f f\n= + (9.30)\n\nThe derivation is valid for any number of thin lenses in contact. If\nseveral thin lenses of focal length f\n\n1\n, f\n\n2\n, f\n\n3\n,... are in contact, the effective\n\nfocal length of their combination is given by\n\n1 2 3\n\n1 1 1 1\n\nf f f f\n= + + + … (9.31)\n\nIn terms of power, Eq. (9.31) can be written as\n\nP = P\n1\n + P\n\n2\n + P\n\n3\n + … (9.32)\n\nwhere P is the net power of the lens combination. Note that the sum in\nEq. (9.32) is an algebraic sum of individual powers, so some of the terms\n\non the right side may be positive (for convex lenses) and some negative\n(for concave lenses). Combination of lenses helps to obtain diverging or\nconverging lenses of desired magnification. It also enhances sharpness\n\nof the image. Since the image formed by the first lens becomes the object\nfor the second, Eq. (9.25) implies that the total magnification m of the\ncombination is a product of magnification (m\n\n1\n, m\n\n2\n, m\n\n3\n,...) of individual\n\nlenses\n\nm = m\n1 \nm\n\n2\n m\n\n3\n  ...

The angle between the\n\nemergent ray RS and the direction of the incident ray PQ is called the\nangle of deviation, δ.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nRay Optics and\n\nOptical Instruments\n\n331\n\nIn the quadrilateral AQNR, two of the angles\n(at the vertices Q and R) are right angles.\nTherefore, the sum of the other angles of the\n\nquadrilateral is 180°.\n\n∠A + ∠QNR = 180°\nFrom the triangle QNR,\n\nr\n1\n + r2 + ∠QNR = 180°\n\nComparing these two equations, we get\n\nr\n1\n + r2 = A (9.34)\n\nThe total deviation δ  is the sum of deviations\nat the two faces,\n\nδ = (i – r\n1\n ) + (e – r2 )\n\nthat is,\n\nδ  = i + e – A (9.35)\nThus, the angle of deviation depends on the angle of incidence. A plot\n\nbetween the angle of deviation and angle of incidence is shown in\nFig. 9.24. You can see that, in general, any given value of δ,  except for\ni = e, corresponds to two values i and hence of e. This, in fact, is expected\nfrom the symmetry of i and e in Eq. (9.35), i.e., δ  remains the same if i\nand e are interchanged. Physically, this is related\nto the fact that the path of ray in Fig. 9.23 can be\ntraced back, resulting in the same angle of\n\ndeviation. At the minimum deviation D\nm\n, the\n\nrefracted ray inside the prism becomes parallel\nto its base.  We have\n\nδ = D\nm\n, i = e which implies r\n\n1\n = r\n\n2\n.\n\nEquation (9.34) gives\n\n2r = A or r = \n2\n\nA\n(9.36)\n\nIn the same way, Eq. (9.35) gives\n\nD\nm\n = 2i – A, or i = (A + D\n\nm\n)/2        (9.37)\n\nThe refractive index of the prism is\n\n2\n21\n\n1\n\nsin[( )/2]\n\nsin[ /2]\nmA Dnn\n\nn A\n\n+\n= = (9.38)\n\nThe angles A and D\nm\n can be measured\n\nexperimentally.  Equation (9.38) thus provides a\nmethod of determining refractive index of the material of the prism.\n\nFor a small angle prism, i.e., a thin prism, D\nm  \n\nis also very small, and\nwe get\n\n( )\n21\n\n/2sin[( )/2]\n\nsin[ /2] /2\n\nmm\nA DA D\n\nn\nA A\n\n++\n= �\n\nD\nm\n = (n\n\n21\n–1)A\n\nIt implies that, thin prisms do not deviate light much.\n\nFIGURE 9.23 A ray of light passing through\n\na triangular glass prism.\n\nFIGURE 9.24 Plot of angle of deviation (δ )\nversus angle of incidence (i ) for a\n\ntriangular prism.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n332\n\n9.7  SOME NATURAL PHENOMENA DUE TO SUNLIGHT\n\nThe Interplay of light with things around us gives rise to several beautiful\n\nphenomena. The spectacles of colours that we see around us all the time\n\nis possible due to sunlight.\n\nWhile studying dispersion of visible (or white) light by a prism\n\n(Class X) and the electromagnetic spectrum (Chapter 8, Class XII), we\n\ngot to know that colour is associated with the frequency of light or the\n\nwavelength of light in the given medium. In the visible spectrum, red\n\nlight is at the long wavelength end (~700 nm) while the violet light is at\n\nthe short wavelength end (~ 400 nm). Dispersion takes place because\n\nthe refractive index of medium for different frequencies (colours) is\n\ndifferent. For example, the bending of red component of white light is\n\nleast while it is most for the violet. Equivalently, red light travels faster\n\nthan violet light in a glass prism. Table 9.2 gives the refractive indices for\n\ndifferent wavelength for crown glass and flint glass. Thick lenses could\n\nbe assumed as made of many prisms, therefore, thick lenses show\n\nchromatic aberration due to dispersion of light. When white light passes\n\nthrough thick lenses, red and blue colours focus at different points. This\n\nphenomenon is known as chromatic aberration.\n\nColour Wavelength (nm) Crown glass Flint glass\n\nViolet 396.9 1.533 1.663\n\nBlue 486.1 1.523 1.639\n\nYellow 589.3 1.517 1.627\n\nRed 656.3 1.515 1.622\n\nTABLE 9.2 REFRACTIVE INDICES FOR DIFFERENT WAVELENGTHS\n\nThe variation of refractive index with wavelength may be more\n\npronounced in some media than the other. In vacuum, of course, the\n\nspeed of light is independent of wavelength. Thus, vacuum (or air\n\napproximately) is a non-dispersive medium in which all colours travel\n\nwith the same speed. This also follows from the fact that sunlight reaches\n\nus in the form of white light and not as its components. On the other\n\nhand, glass is a dispersive medium.\n\nThe blue of the sky, white clouds, the red-hue at sunrise and sunset,\n\nthe rainbow, the brilliant colours of some pearls, shells, and wings of\n\nbirds, are just a few of the natural wonders we are used to. We describe\n\nsome of them here from the point of view of physics.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nRay Optics and\n\nOptical Instruments\n\n333\n\n9.7.1  The rainbow\n\nThe rainbow is an example of the dispersion of sunlight by the water\ndrops in the atmosphere. This is a phenomenon due to combined effect\nof dispersion, refraction and reflection of sunlight by spherical water\n\ndroplets of rain. The conditions for observing a rainbow are that the Sun\nshould be shining in one part of the sky (say near western horizon) while\nit is raining in the opposite part of the sky (say eastern horizon).\n\nAn observer can therefore see a rainbow only when his back is towards\nthe Sun.\n\nIn order to understand the formation of rainbows, consider\n\nFig. 9.25(a). Sunlight is first refracted as it enters a raindrop, which causes\nthe different wavelengths (colours) of white light to separate. Longer\nwangelength of light (red) are bent the least while the shorter wavelength\n\n(violet) are bent the most. Next, these component rays strike the inner\nsurface of the water drop and get internally reflected if the angle between\nthe refracted ray and normal to the drop surface is greater then the critical\n\nangle (48° in this case). The reflected light is refracted again when it comes\nout of the drop, as shown in the figure. It is found that the violet light\nemerges at an angle of 40° related to the incoming sunlight and red light\n\nemerges at an angle of 42°. For other colours, angles lie in between these\ntwo values.\n\nFigure 9.25(b) explains the formation of primary rainbow. We see\n\nthat red light from drop 1 and violet light from drop 2 reach the observer’s\neye. The violet from drop 1 and red light from drop 2 are directed at level\nabove or below the observer. Thus the observer sees a rainbow with\n\nred colour on the top and violet on the bottom. The primary\nrainbow is a result of three-step process, that is, refraction, reflection\nand refraction.\n\nF\no\nr\nm\n\na\nt\nio\n\nn\n o\n\nf r\na\nin\n\nb\no\nw\n\ns\n\nh\nttp\n\n://w\nw\n\nw\n.e\n\no\n.u\n\nc\na\nr.e\n\nd\nu\n/ra\n\nin\nb\no\nw\n\ns\nh\nttp\n\n://w\nw\n\nw\n.a\n\nto\np\ntic\n\ns.c\no\n.u\n\nk\n/b\n\no\nw\n\ns.h\ntm\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n334\n\nWhen light rays undergoes two internal reflections inside a raindrop,\ninstead of one as in the primary rainbow, a secondary rainbow is formed\n\nas shown in Fig. 9.25(c). It is due to four-step process. The intensity of\nlight is reduced at the second reflection and hence the secondary rainbow\nis fainter than the primary rainbow. Further, the order of the colours is\n\nreversed in it as is clear from Fig. 9.25(c).\n\n9.7.2  Scattering of light\n\nAs sunlight travels through the earth’s atmosphere, it gets scattered\n(changes its direction) by the atmospheric particles. Light of shorter\nwavelengths is scattered much more than light of longer wavelengths.\n\n(The amount of scattering is inversely proportional to the fourth power\nof the wavelength. This is known as Rayleigh scattering). Hence, the bluish\ncolour predominates in a clear sky, since blue has a shorter wave-\n\nlength than red and is scattered much more strongly. In fact, violet\ngets scattered even more than blue, having a shorter wavelength.\nBut since our eyes are more sensitive to blue than violet, we see the\n\nsky blue.\nLarge particles like dust and water droplets present in the atmosphere\n\nbehave differently. The relevant quantity here is the relative size of the\n\nwavelength of light λ, and the scatterer (of typical size, say, a). For a << λ,\none has Rayleigh scattering which is proportional to 1/λ4. For a >> λ,\ni.e., large scattering objects (for example, raindrops, large dust or ice\n\nparticles) this is not true; all wavelengths are scattered nearly equally.\nThus, clouds which have droplets of water with a >> λ are generally white.\n\nFIGURE 9.25  Rainbow: (a) The sun rays incident on a water drop get\nrefracted twice and reflected internally by a drop; (b) Enlarged view of\ninternal reflection and refraction of a ray of light inside a drop forming\n\nprimary rainbow; and (c) secondary rainbow is formed by rays undergoing\ninternal reflection twice inside the drop.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nRay Optics and\n\nOptical Instruments\n\n335\n\nAt sunset or sunrise, the sun’s rays have to pass through a larger\ndistance in the atmosphere (Fig. 9.26). Most of the blue and other shorter\nwavelengths are removed by scattering. The least scattered light reaching\nour eyes, therefore, the sun looks reddish. This explains the reddish\nappearance of the sun and full moon near the horizon.\n\n9.8  OPTICAL INSTRUMENTS\nA number of optical devices and instruments have been designed utilising\n\nreflecting and refracting properties of mirrors, lenses and prisms.\nPeriscope, kaleidoscope, binoculars, telescopes, microscopes are some\nexamples of optical devices and instruments that are in common use.\n\nOur eye is, of course, one of the most important optical device the nature\nhas endowed us with. We have already studied about the human eye in\nClass X. We now go on to describe the principles of working of the\n\nmicroscope and the telescope.\n\n9.8.1  The microscope\n\nA simple magnifier or microscope is a converging lens of small focal length\n\n(Fig. 9.27). In order to use such a lens as a microscope, the lens is held\n\nFIGURE 9.26  Sunlight travels through a longer distance in the\n\natmosphere at sunset and sunrise.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n336\n\nnear the object, one focal length away or less, and the eye is positioned\n\nclose to the lens on the other side. The idea is to get an erect, magnified\n\nand virtual image of the object at a distance so that it can be viewed\n\ncomfortably, i.e., at 25 cm or more. If the object is at a distance f, the\n\nimage is at infinity. However, if the object is at a distance slightly less\n\nthan the focal length of the lens, the image is virtual and closer than\n\ninfinity. Although the closest comfortable distance for viewing the image\n\nis when it is at the near point (distance D ≅ 25 cm), it causes some strain\non the eye. Therefore, the image formed at infinity is often considered\n\nmost suitable for viewing by the relaxed eye. We show both cases, the\n\nfirst in Fig. 9.27(a), and the second in Fig. 9.27(b) and (c).\n\nThe linear magnification m, for the image formed at the near point D,\n\nby a simple microscope can be obtained by using the relation\n\nm\nv\n\nu\nv\n\nv f\n\nv\n\nf\n= =\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f7 =\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f7\n\n1 1\n1– –\n\nNow according to our sign convention, v is negative, and is equal in\n\nmagnitude to D. Thus, the magnification is\n\nm\nD\n\nf\n= +\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n1 (9.39)\n\nFIGURE 9.27  A simple microscope; (a) the magnifying lens is located\nsuch that the image is at the near point,  (b) the angle subtanded by the\nobject, is the same as that at the near point, and  (c) the object near the\n\nfocal point of the lens; the image is far off but closer than infinity.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nRay Optics and\n\nOptical Instruments\n\n337\n\nSince D is about 25 cm, to have a magnification of six, one needs a convex\n\nlens of focal length, f = 5 cm.\n\nNote that m = h′/h where h is the size of the object and h′ the size of\nthe image. This is also the ratio of the angle subtended by the image\n\nto that subtended by the object, if placed at D for comfortable viewing.\n\n(Note that this is not the angle actually subtended by the object at the\n\neye, which is h/u.) What a single-lens simple magnifier achieves is that it\n\nallows the object to be brought closer to the eye than D.\n\nWe will now find the magnification when the image is at infinity. In\n\nthis case we will have to obtained the angular magnification. Suppose\n\nthe object has a height h. The maximum angle it can subtend, and be\n\nclearly visible (without a lens), is when it is at the near point, i.e., a distance\n\nD. The angle subtended is then given by\n\ntan θo\nh\n\nD\n= \uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n≈ θ\no\n\n(9.40)\n\nWe now find the angle subtended at the eye by the image when the\n\nobject is at u. From the relations\n\n \nh v\n\nm\nh u\n\n′\n= =\n\nwe have the angle subtended by the image\n\n tan \ni\n\nh h v h\n\nv v u u\nθ\n\n′\n= = ⋅ =\n\n− − −\n≈θ\n\n \n.

(9.39), but the viewing is more comfortable and the difference\n\nin magnification is usually small. In subsequent discussions of optical\n\ninstruments (microscope and telescope) we shall assume the image to be\n\nat infinity.\n\nA simple microscope has a limited maximum magnification (≤ 9) for\nrealistic focal lengths. For much larger magnifications, one uses two lenses,\n\none compounding the effect of the other. This is known as a compound\n\nmicroscope. A schematic diagram of a compound microscope is shown\n\nin Fig. 9.28. The lens nearest the object, called the objective, forms a\n\nreal, inverted, magnified image of the object. This serves as the object for\n\nthe second lens, the eyepiece, which functions essentially like a simple\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n338\n\nmicroscope or magnifier, produces the final image, which is enlarged\n\nand virtual. The first inverted image is thus near (at or within) the focal\n\nplane of the eyepiece, at a distance appropriate for final image formation\n\nat infinity, or a little closer for image formation at the near point. Clearly,\n\nthe final image is inverted with respect to the original object.\n\nWe now obtain the magnification due to a compound microscope.\n\nThe ray diagram of Fig. 9.28 shows that the (linear) magnification due to\n\nthe objective, namely h′/h, equals\n\nO\n\no\n\nh L\nm\n\nh f\n\n′\n= = (9.43)\n\nwhere we have used the result\n\ntan β =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n=\n′\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\nh\n\nf\n\nh\n\nLo\n\nHere h′ is the size of the first image, the object size being h and f\no\n\nbeing the focal length of the objective. The first image is formed near the\n\nfocal point of the eyepiece. The distance L, i.e., the distance between the\n\nsecond focal point of the objective and the first focal point of the eyepiece\n\n(focal length f\ne\n) is called the tube length of the compound microscope.\n\nAs the first inverted image is near the focal point of the eyepiece, we\n\nuse the result from the discussion above for the simple microscope to\n\nobtain the (angular) magnification m\ne\n due to it  [Eq.

In practice, it is difficult to make the focal length much smaller\n\nthan 1 cm. Also large lenses are required to make L large.\n\nFor example, with an objective with f\no\n = 1.0 cm, and an eyepiece with\n\nfocal length f\ne\n = 2.0 cm, and a tube length of 20 cm, the magnification is\n\nm m m\nL\n\nf\n\nD\n\nf\no e\n\no e\n\n= =\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f7\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f7\n\n     \n20 25\n\n250\n1 2\n\n\uf03d \uf0b4 \uf03d\n\nVarious other factors such as illumination of the object, contribute to\n\nthe quality and visibility of the image. In modern microscopes, multi-\n\ncomponent lenses are used for both the objective and the eyepiece to\n\nimprove image quality by minimising various optical aberrations (defects)\n\nin lenses.\n\n9.8.2  Telescope\n\nThe telescope is used to provide angular magnification of distant objects\n\n(Fig. 9.29). It also has an objective and an eyepiece. But here, the objective\n\nhas a large focal length and a much larger aperture than the eyepiece.\n\nLight from a distant object enters the objective and a real image is formed\n\nin the tube at its second focal point. The eyepiece magnifies this image\n\nproducing a final inverted image. The magnifying power m is the ratio of\n\nthe angle β subtended at the eye by the final image to the angle α which\nthe object subtends at the lens or the eye.

Refracting telescopes can be used both for\n\nterrestrial and astronomical observations. For example, consider\n\na telescope whose objective has a focal length of 100 cm and the eyepiece\n\na focal length of 1 cm. The magnifying power of this telescope is\n\nm = 100/1 = 100.\n\nT\nh\n\ne\n w\n\no\nr\nld\n\n’s\n la\n\nr\ng\ne\ns\nt\n o\n\np\nt\nic\n\na\nl t\n\ne\nle\n\ns\nc\no\np\n\ne\ns\n\nh\nttp\n\n://a\nstro\n\n.n\nin\n\ne\np\nla\n\nn\ne\nts.o\n\nrg\n/b\n\nig\ne\ny\ne\ns.h\n\ntm\nl\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n340\n\nLet us consider a pair of stars of actual separation 1′ (one minute of\narc). The stars appear as though they are separated by an angle of 100 ×\n1′ = 100′ =1.67°.\n\nFIGURE 9.29  A refracting telescope.\n\nThe main considerations with an astronomical telescope are its light\n\ngathering power and its resolution or resolving power. The former clearly\n\ndepends on the area of the objective. With larger diameters, fainter objects\n\ncan be observed. The resolving power, or the ability to observe two objects\n\ndistinctly, which are in very nearly the same direction, also depends on\n\nthe diameter of the objective. So, the desirable aim in optical telescopes is\n\nto make them with objective of large diameter. The largest lens objective\n\nin use has a diameter of 40 inch (~1.02 m). It is at the Yerkes Observatory\n\nin Wisconsin, USA. Such big lenses tend to be very heavy and therefore,\n\ndifficult to make and support by their edges. Further, it is rather difficult\n\nand expensive to make such large sized lenses which form images that\n\nare free from any kind of chromatic aberration and distortions.\n\nFor these reasons, modern telescopes use a concave mirror rather\n\nthan a lens for the objective. Telescopes with mirror objectives are called\n\nreflecting telescopes. There is no chromatic aberration in a mirror.\n\nMechanical support is much less of a problem since a mirror weighs\n\nmuch less than a lens of equivalent optical quality, and can be supported\n\nover its entire back surface, not just over its rim. One obvious problem\n\nwith a reflecting telescope is that the objective mirror focusses light inside\n\nthe telescope tube. One must have an eyepiece and the observer right\n\nthere, obstructing some light (depending on the size of the observer cage).\n\nThis is what is done in the very large 200 inch (~5.08 m) diameters, Mt.\n\nPalomar telescope, California. The viewer sits near the focal point of the\n\nmirror, in a small cage. Another solution to the problem is to deflect the\n\nlight being focussed by another mirror. One such arrangement using a\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nRay Optics and\n\nOptical Instruments\n\n341\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. Reflection is governed by the equation ∠i = ∠r′   and refraction by the\nSnell’s law, sini/sinr = n, where the incident ray, reflected ray, refracted\n\nray and normal lie in the same plane. Angles of incidence, reflection\n\nand refraction are i, r ′  and r, respectively.\n\n2. The critical angle of incidence i\nc\n for a ray incident from a denser to rarer\n\nmedium, is that angle for which the angle of refraction is 90°. For\n\ni > i\nc\n, total internal reflection occurs. Multiple internal reflections in\n\ndiamond (i\nc\n  ≅  24.4°), totally reflecting prisms and mirage, are some\n\nexamples of total internal reflection. Optical fibres consist of glass\n\nfibres coated with a thin layer of material of lower refractive index.\n\nLight incident at an angle at one end comes out at the other, after\n\nmultiple internal reflections, even if the fibre is bent.\n\n3. Cartesian sign convention: Distances measured in the same direction\n\nas the incident light are positive; those measured in the opposite\n\ndirection are negative. All distances are measured from the pole/optic\n\ncentre of the mirror/lens on the principal axis. The heights measured\n\nupwards above x-axis and normal to the principal axis of the mirror/\n\nlens are taken as positive. The heights measured downwards are taken\n\nas negative.\n\nFIGURE 9.30  Schematic diagram of a reflecting telescope (Cassegrain).\n\nconvex secondary mirror to focus the incident light, which now passes\n\nthrough a hole in the objective primary mirror, is shown in Fig. 9.30.\n\nThis is known as a Cassegrain telescope, after its inventor. It has the\n\nadvantages of a large focal length in a short telescope. The largest telescope\n\nin India is in Kavalur, Tamil Nadu. It is a 2.34 m diameter reflecting\n\ntelescope (Cassegrain). It was ground, polished, set up, and is being used\n\nby the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore.

The laws of reflection and refraction are true for all surfaces and\n\npairs of media at the point of the incidence.\n\n2. The real image of an object placed between f and 2f from a convex lens\n\ncan be seen on a screen placed at the image location. If the screen is\n\nremoved, is the image still there?  This question puzzles many, because\n\nit is difficult to reconcile ourselves with an image suspended in air\n\nwithout a screen. But the image does exist. Rays from a given point\n\non the object are converging to an image point in space and diverging\n\naway. The screen simply diffuses these rays, some of which reach our\n\neye and we see the image. This can be seen by the images formed in\n\nair during a laser show.\n\n3. Image formation needs regular reflection/refraction. In principle, all\n\nrays from a given point should reach the same image point. This is\n\nwhy you do not see your image by an irregular reflecting object, say\n\nthe page of a book.\n\n4. Thick lenses give coloured images due to dispersion. The variety in\n\ncolour of objects we see around us is due to the constituent colours\n\nof the light incident on them. A monochromatic light may produce an\n\nentirely different perception about the colours on an object as seen in\n\nwhite light.\n\n5. For a simple microscope, the angular size of the object equals the\n\nangular size of the image. Yet it offers magnification because we can\n\nkeep the small object much closer to the eye than 25 cm and hence\n\nhave it subtend a large angle. The image is at 25 cm which we can see.\n\nWithout the microscope, you would need to keep the small object at\n\n25 cm which would subtend a very small angle.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n344\n\nEXERCISES\n\n9.1 A small candle, 2.5 cm in size is placed at 27 cm in front of a concave\nmirror of radius of curvature 36 cm.
