Towards the same period at the end\nof 19th century, experimental investigations on conduction of electricity\n(electric discharge) through gases at low pressure in a discharge tube led\nto many historic discoveries. The discovery of X-rays by Roentgen in 1895,\nand of electron by J. J. Thomson in 1897, were important milestones in\nthe understanding of atomic structure. It was found that at sufficiently\nlow pressure of about 0.001 mm of mercury column, a discharge took\nplace between the two electrodes on applying the electric field to the gas\nin the discharge tube. A fluorescent glow appeared on the glass opposite\nto cathode. The colour of glow of the glass depended on the type of glass,\nit  being  yellowish-green for soda glass. The cause of this fluorescence\nwas attributed to the radiation which appeared to be coming from the\ncathode. These cathode rays were discovered, in 1870, by William\nCrookes who later, in 1879, suggested that these rays consisted of streams\nof fast moving negatively charged particles. The British physicist\nJ. J. Thomson (1856-1940) confirmed this hypothesis. By applying\nmutually perpendicular electric and magnetic fields across the discharge\ntube, J. J. Thomson was the first to determine experimentally the speed\nand the specific charge [charge to mass ratio (e/m )] of the cathode ray\n\nChapter Eleven\n\nDUAL NATURE OF\n\nRADIATION AND\n\nMATTER\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n387\n\nDual Nature of Radiation\n\nand Matter\n\nparticles. They were found to travel with speeds ranging from about 0.1\nto 0.2 times the speed of light (3 ×108 m/s). The presently accepted value\nof e/m is 1.76 × 1011 C/kg. Further, the value of e/m was found to be\nindependent of the nature of the material/metal used as the cathode\n(emitter), or the gas introduced in the discharge tube. This observation\nsuggested the universality of the cathode ray particles.\n\nAround the same time, in 1887, it was found that certain metals, when\nirradiated by ultraviolet light, emitted negatively charged particles having\nsmall speeds. Also, certain metals when heated to a high temperature were\nfound to emit negatively charged particles. The value of e/m of these particles\nwas found to be the same as that for cathode ray particles. These\nobservations thus established that all these particles, although produced\nunder different conditions, were identical in nature. J. J. Thomson, in 1897,\nnamed these particles as electrons, and suggested that they were\nfundamental, universal  constituents of matter. For his epoch-making\ndiscovery of electron, through his theoretical and experimental\ninvestigations on conduction of electricity by gasses, he was awarded the\nNobel Prize in Physics in 1906. In 1913, the American physicist R. A.\nMillikan (1868-1953) performed the pioneering oil-drop experiment for\nthe precise measurement of the charge on an electron. He found that  the\ncharge on an oil-droplet was always an integral multiple of an elementary\ncharge, 1.602 × 10–19 C. Millikan’s experiment established that electric\ncharge is quantised. From the values of charge (e ) and specific charge\n(e/m ), the mass (m) of the electron could be determined.\n\n11.2  ELECTRON EMISSION\nWe know that metals have free electrons (negatively charged particles) that\nare responsible for their conductivity. However, the free electrons cannot\nnormally escape out of the metal surface. If an electron attempts to come\nout of the metal, the metal surface acquires a positive charge  and pulls the\nelectron back to  the metal. The free electron is thus held inside the metal\nsurface by the attractive forces of the ions. Consequently, the electron can\ncome out of the metal surface only if it has got sufficient energy to overcome\nthe attractive pull. A certain minimum amount of energy is required to be\ngiven  to an electron to pull it out from the surface of the metal. This\nminimum energy required by an electron to escape from the metal surface\nis called the work function of the metal. It is generally denoted by φ0 and\nmeasured in eV (electron volt). One electron volt is the energy gained by an\nelectron when it has been accelerated by  a  potential difference  of 1 volt, so\nthat  1 eV = 1.602 ×10–19 J.\n\nThis unit of energy is commonly used in atomic and nuclear physics.\nThe work function (φ0)  depends on the properties of the metal and the\nnature of its surface. The values of work function of some metals are\ngiven in Table 11.1. These values are approximate as they are very\nsensitive to surface impurities.\n\nNote from Table 11.1 that the work function of platinum is the highest\n(φ0 = 5.65 eV) while it is the lowest (φ0 = 2.14 eV) for caesium.\n\nThe minimum energy required for the electron emission from the metal\nsurface can be supplied to the free electrons by any one of the following\nphysical processes:\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n388\n\n(i) Thermionic emission: By suitably heating, sufficient thermal energy\ncan be imparted to the free electrons to enable them to come out of the\nmetal.\n\n(ii) Field emission : By applying a very strong electric field (of the order of\n108 V m–1) to a metal, electrons can be pulled out of the metal, as in a\nspark plug.\n\n(iii) Photoelectric emission : When light of suitable frequency illuminates\na metal surface, electrons are emitted from the metal surface. These\nphoto(light)-generated electrons are called photoelectrons.\n\n11.3  PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT\n\n11.3.1  Hertz’s observations\n\nThe phenomenon of photoelectric emission was discovered in 1887 by\nHeinrich Hertz (1857-1894), during his electromagnetic wave experiments.\nIn his experimental investigation on the production of electromagnetic\nwaves by means of a spark discharge, Hertz observed that high voltage\nsparks across the detector loop were enhanced when the emitter plate\nwas illuminated by ultraviolet light from an arc lamp.\n\nLight shining on the metal surface somehow facilitated the escape of\nfree, charged particles which we now know as electrons. When light falls\non a metal surface, some electrons near the surface absorb enough energy\nfrom the incident radiation to overcome the attraction of the positive ions\nin the material of the surface. After gaining sufficient energy from the\nincident light, the electrons escape from the surface of the metal into the\nsurrounding space.\n\n11.3.2  Hallwachs’ and Lenard’s observations\n\nWilhelm Hallwachs and Philipp Lenard investigated the phenomenon of\nphotoelectric emission in detail during 1886-1902.\n\nLenard (1862-1947) observed that when ultraviolet radiations were\nallowed to fall on the emitter plate of an evacuated glass tube enclosing\ntwo electrodes (metal plates), current flows in the circuit (Fig. 11.1). As\nsoon as the ultraviolet radiations were stopped, the current flow also\n\nTABLE 11.1 WORK FUNCTIONS OF SOME METALS\n\nMetal Work function Metal Work function\n\nφφφφφ\nοοοοο\n (eV) φφφφφ\n\nοοοοο\n (eV)\n\nCs 2.14 Al 4.28\n\nK 2.30 Hg 4.49\n\nNa 2.75 Cu 4.65\n\nCa 3.20 Ag 4.70\n\nMo 4.17 Ni 5.15\n\nPb 4.25 Pt 5.65\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n389\n\nDual Nature of Radiation\n\nand Matter\n\nstopped. These observations indicate that when ultraviolet radiations fall\non the emitter plate C, electrons are ejected from it which are attracted\ntowards the positive, collector plate A by the electric field. The electrons\nflow through the evacuated glass tube, resulting in the current flow. Thus,\nlight falling on the surface of the emitter causes current in the external\ncircuit. Hallwachs and Lenard studied how this photo current varied with\ncollector plate potential, and with frequency and intensity of incident light.\n\nHallwachs, in 1888, undertook the study further and connected a\nnegatively charged zinc plate to an electroscope. He observed that the\nzinc plate lost its charge when it was illuminated by ultraviolet light.\nFurther, the uncharged zinc plate became positively charged when it was\nirradiated by ultraviolet light. Positive charge on a  positively charged\nzinc plate was found to be further enhanced when it was illuminated by\nultraviolet light. From these observations he concluded that negatively\ncharged particles were emitted from the zinc plate under the action of\nultraviolet light.\n\nAfter the discovery of the electron in 1897, it became evident that the\nincident light causes electrons to be emitted from the emitter plate. Due\nto negative charge, the emitted electrons are pushed towards the collector\nplate by the electric field. Hallwachs and  Lenard also observed that when\nultraviolet light fell on the emitter plate, no electrons were emitted at all\nwhen the frequency of the incident light was smaller than a certain\nminimum value, called the threshold frequency. This minimum frequency\ndepends on the nature of the material of the emitter plate.\n\nIt was found that certain metals like zinc, cadmium, magnesium, etc.,\nresponded only to ultraviolet light, having short wavelength, to cause\nelectron emission from the surface. However, some alkali metals such as\nlithium, sodium, potassium, caesium and rubidium were sensitive\neven to visible light. All these photosensitive substances emit electrons\nwhen they are illuminated by light. After the discovery of electrons, these\nelectrons were termed as photoelectrons. The phenomenon is called\nphotoelectric effect.\n\n11.4 EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF PHOTOELECTRIC\nEFFECT\n\nFigure 11.1 depicts a  schematic view of the arrangement used for the\nexperimental study of the photoelectric effect. It consists of an evacuated\nglass/quartz tube having a thin photosensitive plate C and another metal\nplate A. Monochromatic light from the source S of sufficiently short\nwavelength passes through the window W and falls on the photosensitive\nplate C  (emitter). A transparent quartz window is sealed on to the glass\ntube, which permits ultraviolet radiation to pass through it and irradiate\nthe photosensitive plate C. The electrons are emitted by the plate C and\nare collected by the plate A (collector), by the electric field created by the\nbattery. The battery maintains the potential difference between the plates\nC and A, that can be varied. The polarity of the plates C and A can be\nreversed by a commutator. Thus, the plate A can be maintained at a desired\npositive or negative potential with respect to emitter C. When the collector\nplate A is positive with respect to the emitter plate C, the electrons are\n\nS\nim\n\nu\nla\n\nte\n e\n\nx\np\n\ne\nrim\n\ne\nn\n\nts\n o\n\nn\n p\n\nh\no\n\nto\ne\nle\n\nc\ntric\n\n e\nffe\n\nc\nt\n\nh\nttp\n\n://w\nw\n\nw\n.k\n\nc\nv\ns.c\n\na\n/site\n\n/p\nro\n\nje\nc\nts/p\n\nh\ny\nsic\n\ns.h\ntm\n\nl\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n390\n\nattracted to it. The emission of electrons causes flow of\nelectric current in the circuit. The potential difference\nbetween the emitter and collector plates is measured by\na voltmeter (V) whereas the resulting photo current\nflowing in the circuit is measured by a microammeter\n(µA). The photoelectric current can be increased or\ndecreased by varying the potential of collector plate A\nwith respect to the emitter plate C. The intensity and\nfrequency of the incident light can be varied, as can the\npotential difference V between the emitter C and the\ncollector A.\n\nWe can use the experimental arrangement of\nFig. 11.1 to study the variation of photocurrent with\n(a) intensity of radiation, (b) frequency of incident\nradiation, (c) the potential difference between the\nplates A and C, and (d) the nature of the material\nof plate C. Light of  different frequencies can be used\nby putting appropriate coloured filter or coloured\n\nglass in the path of light falling on the emitter C. The intensity\nof light is varied by changing the distance of the light source\nfrom the emitter.\n\n11.4.1  Effect of intensity of light on photocurrent\n\nThe collector A is maintained at a positive potential with\nrespect to emitter C so that electrons ejected from C are\nattracted towards collector A. Keeping the frequency of the\nincident radiation and the potential fixed, the intensity of light\nis varied and the resulting photoelectric current is measured\neach time. It is found that the photocurrent increases linearly\nwith intensity of incident light as shown graphically in\nFig. 11.2. The photocurrent is directly  proportional to the\nnumber of photoelectrons emitted per second. This implies\nthat the number of photoelectrons emitted per second is\ndirectly proportional to the intensity of incident radiation.\n\n11.4.2  Effect of potential on photoelectric current\n\nWe first keep the plate A at some positive potential with respect to the\nplate C and illuminate the plate C with light of fixed frequency ν  and fixed\nintensity I1. We next vary the positive potential of plate A gradually and\nmeasure the resulting photocurrent each time. It is found that the\nphotoelectric current increases with increase in positive (accelerating)\npotential. At some stage, for a certain positive potential of plate A, all the\nemitted electrons are  collected by the plate A and the photoelectric current\nbecomes maximum or  saturates. If we increase the accelerating potential\nof plate A further, the photocurrent does not increase. This maximum\nvalue of the photoelectric current is called  saturation current. Saturation\ncurrent corresponds to the case when all the photoelectrons emitted by\nthe emitter plate C reach the collector plate A.\n\nWe now apply a negative (retarding) potential to the plate A with respect\nto the plate C and make it increasingly negative gradually. When the\n\nFIGURE 11.1 Experimental\narrangement for  study of\n\nphotoelectric effect.\n\nFIGURE 11.2 Variation of\nPhotoelectric current with\n\nintensity of light.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n391\n\nDual Nature of Radiation\n\nand Matter\n\npolarity is reversed, the electrons are\nrepelled and only the sufficiently energetic\nelectrons are able to reach the collector A.\nThe photocurrent is found to decrease\nrapidly until it drops to zero at a certain\nsharply defined, critical value of the negative\npotential V0 on the plate A. For a particular\nfrequency of incident radiation, the\nminimum negative (retarding) potential V0\ngiven to the plate A for which the\n\nphotocurrent stops or becomes zero is\n\ncalled the cut-off or stopping potential.\nThe interpretation of the observation in\n\nterms of photoelectrons is straightforward.\nAll the photoelectrons emitted from the\nmetal do not have the same energy.\nPhotoelectric current is zero when the\nstopping potential is sufficient to repel even\nthe most energetic photoelectrons, with the\nmaximum kinetic energy (Kmax), so that\n\nKmax = e V0 (11.1)\n\nWe can now repeat this experiment with incident radiation of the same\nfrequency but of higher intensity I2 and I3 (I3 > I2 > I1). We note that the\nsaturation currents are now found to be at higher values. This shows\nthat more electrons are being emitted per second, proportional to the\nintensity of incident radiation. But the stopping potential remains the\nsame as that for the incident radiation of intensity I1, as shown graphically\nin Fig. 11.3. Thus, for a given frequency of the incident radiation, the\nstopping potential is independent of its intensity. In other words, the\nmaximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons depends on the light source\nand the emitter plate material, but is independent of intensity of incident\nradiation.\n\n11.4.3 Effect of frequency of incident radiation on stopping\npotential\n\nWe now study the relation between the\nfrequency ν of the incident radiation and the\nstopping potential V0. We suitably adjust the\nsame intensity of light radiation at various\nfrequencies and study the variation of\nphotocurrent with collector plate potential. The\nresulting variation is shown in Fig. 11.4. We\nobtain different values of stopping potential but\nthe same value of the saturation current for\nincident radiation of different frequencies. The\nenergy of the emitted electrons depends on the\nfrequency of the incident radiations. The\nstopping potential is more negative for higher\nfrequencies of incident radiation. Note from\n\nFIGURE 11.3 Variation of  photocurrent with\ncollector plate potential for different\n\nintensity of incident radiation.\n\nFIGURE 11.4 Variation of photoelectric current\nwith collector plate potential for different\n\nfrequencies of incident radiation.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n392\n\nFig. 11.4  that the stopping potentials are in the\norder V03 > V02 > V01 if the frequencies are in the\norder ν3 > ν2 > ν1 . This implies that greater the\nfrequency of incident light, greater is the\nmaximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons.\nConsequently, we need greater retarding\npotential to stop them completely. If we plot a\ngraph between the frequency of incident radiation\nand the corresponding stopping potential for\ndifferent metals we get a straight line, as shown\nin Fig. 11.5.\n\nThe graph shows that\n(i) the stopping potential V0 varies linearly with\n\nthe frequency of incident radiation for a given\nphotosensitive material.\n\n(ii) there exists a certain minimum cut-off frequency ν0 for which the\nstopping potential is zero.\n\nThese observations have two implications:\n(i) The maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons varies linearly\n\nwith the frequency of incident radiation, but is independent of its\n\nintensity.\n\n(ii) For a frequency ν of incident radiation, lower than the cut-off\nfrequency ν0, no photoelectric emission is possible even if the\nintensity is large.\n\nThis minimum, cut-off frequency ν0, is called the threshold frequency.\nIt is different for different metals.\n\nDifferent photosensitive materials respond differently to light. Selenium\nis more sensitive than zinc or copper. The same photosensitive substance\ngives different response to light of different wavelengths. For example,\nultraviolet light gives rise to  photoelectric effect in copper  while green or\nred light does not.\n\nNote that in all the above experiments, it is found that, if frequency of\nthe incident radiation exceeds the threshold frequency, the photoelectric\nemission starts instantaneously without any apparent time lag, even if\nthe incident radiation is very dim. It is now known that emission starts in\na time of the order of 10– 9 s or less.\n\nWe now summarise the experimental features and observations\ndescribed in this section.\n(i) For a given photosensitive material and frequency of incident radiation\n\n(above the threshold frequency), the photoelectric current is directly\nproportional to the intensity of incident light (Fig. 11.2).\n\n(ii) For a given photosensitive material and frequency of incident radiation,\nsaturation current is found to be proportional to the intensity of\nincident radiation whereas the stopping potential is independent of\nits intensity (Fig. 11.3).\n\n(iii) For a given photosensitive material, there exists a certain minimum\ncut-off frequency of the incident radiation, called the threshold\nfrequency, below which no emission of photoelectrons takes place,\nno matter how intense the incident light is. Above the threshold\nfrequency, the stopping potential or equivalently the maximum kinetic\n\nFIGURE 11.5 Variation of stopping potential V\n0\n\nwith frequency ν of incident radiation for a\ngiven photosensitive material.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n393\n\nDual Nature of Radiation\n\nand Matter\n\nenergy of the emitted photoelectrons increases linearly with the\nfrequency of the incident radiation, but is independent of its intensity\n(Fig. 11.5).\n\n(iv) The photoelectric emission is an instantaneous process without any\napparent time lag (∼10– 9s or less), even when the incident radiation is\nmade exceedingly dim.\n\n11.5 PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT AND WAVE THEORY\nOF LIGHT\n\nThe wave nature of light was well established by the end of the nineteenth\ncentury. The phenomena of interference, diffraction and polarisation were\nexplained in a natural and satisfactory way by the wave picture of light.\nAccording to this picture, light is an electromagnetic wave consisting  of\nelectric and magnetic fields with continuous distribution of energy over\nthe region of space over which the wave is extended. Let us now see if this\nwave picture of light can explain the observations on photoelectric\nemission given in the previous section.\n\nAccording to the wave picture of light, the free electrons at the surface\nof the metal (over which the beam of radiation falls) absorb the radiant\nenergy continuously. The greater the intensity of radiation, the greater are\nthe amplitude of electric and magnetic fields. Consequently, the greater\nthe intensity, the greater should be the energy absorbed by each electron.\nIn this picture, the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons on the\nsurface is then expected to increase with increase in intensity. Also, no\nmatter what the frequency of radiation is, a sufficiently intense beam of\nradiation (over sufficient time) should be able to impart enough energy to\nthe electrons, so that they exceed the minimum energy needed to escape\nfrom the metal surface . A threshold frequency, therefore, should not exist.\nThese expectations of the wave theory directly contradict observations (i),\n(ii) and (iii) given at the end of sub-section 11.4.3.\n\nFurther, we should note that in the wave picture, the absorption of\nenergy by electron takes place continuously over the entire\nwavefront of the radiation. Since a large number of electrons absorb energy,\nthe energy absorbed per electron per unit time turns out to be small.\nExplicit calculations estimate that it can take hours or more for a single\nelectron to pick up sufficient energy to overcome the work function and\ncome out of the metal. This conclusion is again in striking contrast to\nobservation (iv) that the photoelectric emission is instantaneous. In short,\nthe wave picture is unable to explain the most basic features of\nphotoelectric  emission.\n\n11.6 EINSTEIN’S PHOTOELECTRIC EQUATION: ENERGY\nQUANTUM OF RADIATION\n\nIn 1905, Albert Einstein (1879-1955) proposed a radically new picture\nof electromagnetic radiation to explain photoelectric effect. In this picture,\nphotoelectric emission does not take place by continuous absorption of\nenergy from radiation. Radiation energy is built up of discrete units – the\nso called quanta of energy of radiation. Each quantum of radiant energy\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n394\n\nhas energy hν, where h is Planck’s constant and ν the\nfrequency of light. In photoelectric effect, an electron\nabsorbs a quantum of energy (hν ) of radiation. If this\nquantum of energy absorbed exceeds the minimum\nenergy needed for the electron to escape from the metal\nsurface (work function φ0), the electron is emitted with\nmaximum kinetic energy\n\nKmax = hν – φ0 (11.2)\n\nMore tightly bound electrons will emerge with kinetic\nenergies less than the maximum value. Note that the\nintensity of light of a given frequency is determined by\nthe number of photons incident per second. Increasing\nthe intensity will increase the number of emitted electrons\nper second. However, the maximum kinetic energy of the\nemitted photoelectrons is determined by the energy of each\nphoton.\n\nEquation (11.2) is known as Einstein’s photoelectric\nequation. We now see how this equation accounts in a\nsimple and elegant manner all the observations on\nphotoelectric effect given at the end of  sub-section 11.4.3.\n• According to Eq. (11.2), Kmax depends linearly on ν,\n\nand is independent of intensity of radiation, in\nagreement with observation. This has happened\nbecause in Einstein’s picture, photoelectric effect arises\nfrom the absorption of a single quantum of radiation\nby a single electron. The intensity of radiation (that is\nproportional to the number of energy quanta per unit\narea per unit time) is irrelevant to this basic process.\n\n• Since Kmax must be non-negative, Eq. (11.2 ) implies\nthat photoelectric emission is possible only if\nh ν > φ0\nor ν > ν0 , where\n\nν0 = \n0\n\nh\n\nφ\n(11.3)\n\nEquation (11.3) shows that the greater the work\nfunction φ0, the higher the minimum or threshold\nfrequency ν0 needed to emit photoelectrons. Thus,\nthere exists a threshold frequency ν0 (= φ0/h) for the\nmetal surface, below which no photoelectric  emission\nis possible, no matter how intense the incident\nradiation may be or how long it falls on the surface.\n\n• In this picture, intensity of radiation as noted above,\nis proportional to the number of energy quanta per\nunit area per unit time. The greater the number of\nenergy quanta available, the greater is the number of\nelectrons absorbing the energy quanta  and greater,\ntherefore, is the number of electrons coming out of\nthe metal (for ν > ν0). This explains why, for ν > ν0 ,\nphotoelectric current is proportional to intensity.\n\nA\nL\nB\n\nE\nR\n\nT\n E\n\nIN\nS\n\nT\nE\n\nIN\n (\n\n1\n8\n\n7\n9\n –\n\n 1\n9\n5\n5\n)\n\nAlbert Einstein (1879 –\n1955) Einstein, one of the\ngreatest physicists of all\ntime, was born in Ulm,\nGermany. In 1905, he\npublished three path-\nbreaking papers.  In the\nfirst paper, he introduced\nthe notion of light quanta\n(now called photons) and\nused it to explain the\nfeatures of photoelectric\neffect.  In the second paper,\nhe developed a theory of\nBrownian motion,\nconfirmed experimentally a\nfew years later and provided\na convincing evidence of\nthe atomic picture of matter.\nThe third paper gave birth\nto the special theory of\nrelativity. In 1916, he\npublished the general\ntheory of relativity. Some of\nEinstein’s most significant\nlater contributions are: the\nnotion of stimulated\nemission introduced in an\nalternative derivation of\nPlanck’s blackbody\nradiation law, static model\nof the universe which\nstarted modern cosmology,\nquantum statistics of a gas\nof massive bosons, and a\ncritical analysis of the\nfoundations of quantum\nmechanics. In 1921, he was\nawarded the Nobel Prize in\nphysics for his contribution\nto theoretical physics and\nthe photoelectric effect.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n395\n\nDual Nature of Radiation\n\nand Matter\n\n• In Einstein’s picture, the basic elementary process involved in\nphotoelectric effect is the absorption of a light quantum by an electron.\nThis process is instantaneous. Thus, whatever may be the intensity\ni.e., the number of quanta of radiation per unit area per unit time,\nphotoelectric emission is instantaneous. Low intensity does not mean\ndelay in emission, since the basic elementary process is the same.\nIntensity only determines how many electrons are able to participate\nin the elementary process (absorption of a light quantum by a single\nelectron) and, therefore, the photoelectric current.\n\nUsing Eq. (11.1), the photoelectric equation, Eq. (11.2), can be\nwritten as\n\ne V0 = h ν  – φ 0;  for 0ν ν≥\n\nor  V0 = \n0h\n\ne e\n\nφ\nν\n\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n−\uf8ec \uf8f7\uf8ed \uf8f8\n\n(11.4)\n\nThis is an important result. It predicts that the V0 versus ν  curve is a\nstraight line with slope = (h/e), independent of the nature of the material.\nDuring 1906-1916, Millikan performed a series of experiments on\nphotoelectric effect, aimed at disproving Einstein’s photoelectric equation.\nHe measured the slope of the straight line obtained for sodium, similar to\nthat shown in Fig. 11.5. Using the known value of e, he determined the\nvalue of Planck’s constant h. This value was close to the value of Planck’s\ncontant (= 6.626 × 10–34J s) determined in an entirely different context.\nIn this way, in 1916, Millikan proved the validity of Einstein’s photoelectric\nequation, instead of disproving it.\n\nThe successful explanation of photoelectric effect using the hypothesis\nof light quanta and the experimental determination of values of h and φ0,\nin agreement with values obtained from other experiments, led to the\nacceptance of Einstein’s picture of photoelectric effect. Millikan verified\nphotoelectric equation with great precision, for a number of alkali metals\nover a wide range of radiation frequencies.\n\n11.7  PARTICLE NATURE OF LIGHT: THE PHOTON\nPhotoelectric effect thus gave evidence to the strange fact that light in\ninteraction with matter behaved as if it was made of quanta or packets of\nenergy, each of energy h ν.\n\nIs the light quantum of energy to be associated with a particle? Einstein\narrived at the important result, that the light quantum can also be\nassociated with momentum (h ν/c ). A definite value of energy as well as\nmomentum is a strong sign that the light quantum can be associated\nwith a particle. This particle was later named photon. The particle-like\nbehaviour of light was further confirmed, in 1924, by the experiment of\nA.H. Compton (1892-1962) on scattering of X-rays from electrons. In\n1921, Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his contribution\nto theoretical physics and the photoelectric effect. In 1923, Millikan was\nawarded the Nobel Prize in physics for his work on the elementary\ncharge of electricity and on the photoelectric effect.\n\nWe can summarise the photon picture of electromagnetic  radiation\nas follows:\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n396\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n1\n.1\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n1\n.2\n\n(i) In interaction of radiation with matter, radiation behaves as if it is\nmade up of particles called photons.\n\n(ii) Each photon has energy E (=hν) and momentum p (= h ν/c), and\nspeed c, the speed of light.\n\n(iii) All photons of light of a particular frequency  ν, or wavelength λ, have\nthe same energy E (=hν  = hc/λ) and momentum  p (= hν/c = h/λ),\nwhatever the intensity of radiation may be. By increasing the intensity\nof light of given wavelength, there is only an increase in the number of\nphotons per second crossing a given area, with each photon having\nthe same energy. Thus, photon energy is independent of intensity of\nradiation.\n\n(iv) Photons are electrically neutral and are not deflected by electric and\nmagnetic fields.\n\n(v) In a photon-particle collision (such as photon-electron collision), the\ntotal energy and total momentum are conserved. However, the number\nof photons may not be conserved in a collision. The photon may be\nabsorbed or a new photon may be created.\n\nExample 11.1 Monochromatic light of frequency 6.0 ×1014 Hz is\nproduced by a laser. The power emitted is 2.0 ×10–3 W.

The wave nature of light shows up in the phenomena\nof interference, diffraction and polarisation. On the other hand, in\nphotoelectric effect and Compton effect which involve energy and\nmomentum transfer, radiation behaves as if it is made up of a bunch of\nparticles – the photons. Whether a particle or wave description is best\nsuited for understanding an experiment depends on the nature of the\nexperiment. For example, in the familiar  phenomenon of seeing an object\nby our eye, both descriptions are important. The gathering and focussing\nmechanism of light by the eye-lens is well described in the wave picture.\nBut its absorption by the rods and cones (of the retina) requires the photon\npicture of light.\n\nA natural question arises: If radiation has a dual (wave-particle) nature,\nmight not the particles of nature (the electrons, protons, etc.) also exhibit\nwave-like character? In 1924, the French physicist Louis Victor de Broglie\n(pronounced as de Broy) (1892-1987) put forward the bold hypothesis\nthat moving particles of matter should display wave-like properties under\nsuitable conditions. He reasoned that nature was symmetrical and that\nthe two basic physical entities – matter and energy, must have symmetrical\ncharacter. If radiation shows dual aspects, so should matter. De Broglie\nproposed that the wave length λ  associated with a particle of momentum\np is given as\n\nλ  = \nh h\n\np m v\n= (11.5)\n\nwhere m  is the mass of the particle and v its speed. Equation (11.5) is\nknown as the de Broglie relation and the wavelength λ of the matter\nwave is called de Broglie wavelength. The dual aspect of matter is evident\nin the de Broglie relation. On the left hand side of Eq. (11.5), λ  is the\nattribute of a wave while on the right hand side the momentum p is a\ntypical attribute of a particle. Planck’s constant  h  relates the two\nattributes.\n\nEquation (11.5) for a material particle is basically a hypothesis whose\nvalidity can be tested only by experiment. However, it is interesting to see\nthat it is satisfied also by a photon. For a photon, as we have seen,\n\np = hν /c (11.6)\n\nTherefore,\n\nh c\n\np\nλ\n\nν\n= = (11.7)\n\nThat is, the de Broglie wavelength of a photon given by Eq. (11.5) equals\nthe wavelength of electromagnetic radiation of which the photon is a\nquantum of energy and momentum.\n\nClearly, from Eq. (11.5 ), λ  is smaller for a heavier particle ( large m ) or\nmore energetic particle (large v). For example, the de Broglie wavelength\nof a ball of mass 0.12 kg moving with a speed of 20 m s–1 is easily\ncalculated:\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n399\n\nDual Nature of Radiation\n\nand Matter\n\np = m v = 0.12 kg × 20 m s–1 = 2.40 kg m s–1\n\nλ = \nh\n\np\n = \n\n34\n\n1\n\n6.63 10 J s\n2.40 kg m s\n\n−\n\n−\n\n×\n = 2.76 × 10–34 m\n\nPHOTOCELL\n\nA photocell is a technological application of the photoelectric effect. It is a device whose\nelectrical properties are affected by light. It is also sometimes called an electric eye. A photocell\nconsists of a semi-cylindrical photo-sensitive metal plate C (emitter) and a wire loop A\n(collector) supported in an evacuated glass or quartz bulb. It is connected to the external\ncircuit having a high-tension battery B and microammeter (µA) as shown in the Figure.\nSometimes, instead of the plate C, a thin layer of photosensitive material is pasted on the\ninside of the bulb. A part of the bulb is left clean for the light to enter it.\n\nWhen light of suitable wavelength falls on the\nemitter C, photoelectrons are emitted. These\nphotoelectrons are drawn to the collector A.\nPhotocurrent of the order of a few microampere\ncan be normally obtained from a photo cell.\n\nA photocell converts a change in intensity of\nillumination into a change in photocurrent. This\ncurrent can be used to operate control systems\nand in light measuring devices. A photocell of lead\nsulphide sensitive to infrared radiation is used\nin electronic ignition circuits.\n\nIn scientific work, photo cells are used\nwhenever it is necessary to measure the intensity\nof light. Light meters in photographic cameras\nmake use of photo cells to measure the intensity\nof incident light. The photocells, inserted in the\ndoor light electric circuit, are used as automatic\ndoor opener. A person approaching a doorway\nmay interrupt a light beam which is incident on\na photocell. The abrupt change in photocurrent\nmay be used to start a motor which opens the\ndoor or rings an alarm. They are used in the\ncontrol of a counting device which records every interruption of the light beam caused by a\nperson or object passing across the beam. So photocells help count the persons entering an\nauditorium, provided they enter the hall one by one. They are used for detection of traffic\nlaw defaulters: an alarm may be sounded whenever a beam of (invisible) radiation is\nintercepted.\n\nIn burglar alarm, (invisible) ultraviolet light is continuously made to fall on a photocell\ninstalled at the doorway. A person entering the door interrupts the beam falling on the\nphotocell. The abrupt change in photocurrent is used to start an electric bell ringing. In fire\nalarm, a number of photocells are installed at suitable places in a building. In the event of\nbreaking out of fire, light radiations fall upon the photocell. This completes the electric\ncircuit through an electric bell or a siren which starts operating as a warning signal.\n\nPhotocells are used in the reproduction of sound in motion pictures and in the television\ncamera for scanning and telecasting scenes. They are used in industries for detecting minor\nflaws or holes in metal sheets.\n\nA photo cell\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n400\n\nThis wavelength is so small that it is beyond any\nmeasurement. This is the reason why macroscopic objects\nin our daily life do not show wave-like properties. On the\nother hand, in the sub-atomic domain, the wave character\nof particles is significant and measurable.\n\nConsider an electron (mass m, charge e) accelerated\nfrom rest through a potential V. The kinetic energy K\nof the electron equals the work done (eV ) on it by the\nelectric field:\n\nK = e V (11.8)\n\nNow, K = \n1\n2\n\nm v\n2 = \n\n2\n\n2\np\n\nm\n , so that\n\np = 2  2  m K m e V= (11.9)\n\nThe de Broglie wavelength λ of the electron is then\n\nλ  =  \n2 2 \n\nh h h\n\np m K m eV\n= = (11.10)\n\nSubstituting the numerical values of h, m, e,\nwe get\n\n1.227\n   nm\n\nV\nλ = (11.11)\n\nwhere V is the magnitude of accelerating potential in\nvolts. For a 120 V accelerating potential, Eq. (11.11) gives\nλ  = 0.112 nm. This wavelength is of the same order as\nthe spacing between the atomic planes in crystals. This\n\nsuggests that matter waves associated with an electron could be verified\nby crystal diffraction experiments analogous to X-ray diffraction. We\ndescribe the experimental verification of the de Broglie hypothesis in the\nnext section. In 1929, de Broglie was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics\nfor his discovery of the wave nature of electrons.\n\nThe matter–wave picture elegantly incorporated the Heisenberg’s\nuncertainty principle. According to the principle, it is not possible to\nmeasure both the position and momentum of an electron (or any other\nparticle) at the same time exactly. There is always some uncertainty (∆ x )\nin the specification of position and some uncertainty (∆p ) in the\nspecification of momentum. The product of  ∆x and ∆p is of the order of ħ*\n(with ħ = h/2π), i.e.,\n\n∆x ∆p ≈ ħ (11.12)\n\nEquation (11.12) allows the possibility that ∆x is zero; but then ∆p\nmust be infinite in order that the product is non-zero. Similarly, if ∆p is\nzero, ∆x must be infinite. Ordinarily, both ∆x and ∆p are non-zero such\nthat their product is of the order of ħ.\n\nNow, if an electron has a definite momentum p, (i.e.∆p = 0), by the de\nBroglie relation, it has a definite wavelength λ.

By Born’s\nprobability interpretation this means that the\nelectron is not localised in any finite region of\nspace. That is, its position uncertainty is infinite\n(∆x → ∞), which is consistent with the\nuncertainty principle.\n\nIn general, the matter wave associated with\nthe electron is not extended all over space. It is\na wave packet extending over some finite region\nof space. In that case ∆x is not infinite but has\nsome finite value depending on the extension\nof the wave packet. Also, you must appreciate\nthat a wave packet of finite extension does not\nhave a single wavelength. It is built up of\nwavelengths spread around some central\nwavelength.\n\nBy de Broglie’s relation, then, the\nmomentum of the electron will also have a\nspread – an uncertainty ∆p. This is as expected\nfrom the uncertainty principle. It can be shown\nthat the wave packet description together with\nde Broglie relation and Born’s probability\ninterpretation reproduce the Heisenberg’s\nuncertainty principle exactly.\n\nIn Chapter 12, the de Broglie relation will\nbe seen to justify Bohr’s postulate on\nquantisation of angular momentum of electron\nin an atom.\n\nFigure 11.6 shows a schematic diagram of\n(a) a localised wave packet, and (b) an extended\nwave with fixed wavelength.\n\nExample 11.4 What is the de Broglie wavelength associated with (a) an\nelectron moving with a speed of 5.4×106 m/s, and (b) a ball of mass 150\ng travelling at 30.0 m/s?\n\nSolution\n(a) For the electron:\n\nMass m = 9.11×10–31 kg, speed v = 5.4×106 m/s.

Actually, a truly satisfactory physical understanding of the\ndual nature of matter and radiation has not emerged so far. The great founders of\nquantum mechanics (Niels Bohr, Albert Einstein, and many others) struggled with this\nand related concepts for long. Still the deep physical interpretation of quantum\nmechanics continues to be an area of active research. Despite this, the concept of\nmatter wave has been mathematically introduced in modern quantum mechanics with\ngreat success. An important milestone in this connection was when Max Born (1882-\n1970) suggested a probability interpretation to the matter wave amplitude. According\nto this, the intensity (square of the amplitude) of the matter wave at a point determines\nthe probability density of the particle  at that point. Probability density means probability\nper unit volume. Thus, if A is the amplitude of the wave at a point, |A|2 ∆V is the\nprobability of the particle being found in a small volume ∆V around that point. Thus,\nif the intensity of matter wave is large in a certain region, there is a greater probability\nof the particle being found there than where the intensity is small.\n\nExample 11.6 A particle is moving three times as fast as an electron.\nThe ratio of the de Broglie wavelength of the particle to that of the\nelectron is 1.813 × 10–4.

It consists of an\nelectron gun which comprises of\na tungsten filament F, coated\nwith barium oxide and heated\nby a low voltage power supply\n(L.T. or battery). Electrons\nemitted by the filament are\naccelerated to a desired velocity\n\nFIGURE 11.7 Davisson-Germer electron\ndiffraction arrangement.\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n1\n.6\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n1\n.7\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n404\n\nby applying suitable potential/voltage from a high voltage power supply\n(H.T. or battery). They are made to pass through a cylinder with fine\nholes along its axis, producing a fine collimated beam. The beam is made\nto fall on the surface of a nickel crystal. The electrons are scattered in all\ndirections by the atoms of the crystal. The intensity of the electron beam,\nscattered in a given direction, is measured by the electron detector\n(collector). The detector can be moved on a circular scale and is connected\nto a sensitive galvanometer, which records the current. The deflection of\nthe galvanometer is proportional to the intensity of the electron beam\nentering the collector. The  apparatus is enclosed in an evacuated chamber.\nBy moving the  detector  on the circular scale at different positions, the\nintensity of the scattered electron beam is measured for different values\nof angle of scattering θ which is the angle between the incident and the\nscattered electron beams. The variation of the intensity (I ) of the scattered\nelectrons with the angle of scattering θ  is obtained for different accelerating\nvoltages.\n\nThe experiment was performed by varying the accelarating voltage\nfrom 44 V to 68 V. It was noticed that a strong peak appeared in the\nintensity (I ) of the scattered electron for an accelarating voltage of 54V at\na scattering angle θ = 50°\n\nThe appearance of the peak in a particular direction is due to the\nconstructive interference of electrons scattered from different layers of the\nregularly spaced atoms of the crystals. From the electron diffraction\nmeasurements, the wavelength of matter waves was found to be\n0.165 nm.\n\nThe de Broglie wavelength λ associated with electrons, using\nEq. (11.11), for V = 54 V is given by\n\nλ = h /p \n1 227\n\nV\n=  nm\n\nλ \n1 227\n\n54\n=  nm =  0.167 nm\n\nThus, there is an excellent agreement between the theoretical value\nand the experimentally obtained value of de Broglie wavelength. Davisson-\nGermer experiment thus strikingly confirms the wave nature of electrons\nand the de Broglie relation. More recently, in 1989, the wave nature of a\nbeam of electrons was experimentally demonstrated in a double-slit\nexperiment, similar to that used for the wave nature of light. Also, in an\nexperiment in 1994, interference fringes were obtained with the beams of\niodine molecules, which are about a million times more massive than\nelectrons.\n\nThe de Broglie hypothesis has been basic to the development of modern\nquantum mechanics. It has also led to the field of electron optics. The\nwave properties of electrons have been utilised in the design of electron\nmicroscope which is a great improvement, with higher resolution, over\nthe optical microscope.\n\nD\ne\nv\ne\nlo\n\np\nm\n\ne\nn\nt\n o\n\nf \ne\nle\n\nc\nt\nr\no\nn\n m\n\nic\nr\no\ns\nc\no\np\ne\n\nh\ntt\np\n:/\n/w\n\nw\nw\n\n.n\no\nb\ne\nlp\n\nri\nz\ne\n.o\n\nrg\n/n\n\no\nb\ne\nl_\n\np\nri\nz\ne\ns/\np\nh\ny\nsi\nc\ns/\nla\n\nu\nre\n\na\nte\n\ns/\n1\n9\n8\n6\n/p\n\nre\nse\n\nn\nta\n\nti\no\nn\n-s\n\np\ne\ne\nc\nh\n.h\n\ntm\nl\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n405\n\nDual Nature of Radiation\n\nand Matter\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. The minimum energy needed by an electron to come out from a  metal\nsurface is called the work function of the metal. Energy (greater than\nthe work function (φ\n\nο\n)\n \nrequired for electron emission from the metal\n\nsurface can be supplied by suitably heating or applying strong electric\nfield or irradiating it by light of suitable frequency.\n\n2. Photoelectric effect is the phenomenon of emission of electrons by metals\nwhen illuminated by light of suitable frequency. Certain metals respond\nto ultraviolet light while others are sensitive even to the visible light.\nPhotoelectric effect involves conversion of light energy into electrical\nenergy. It follows the law of conservation of energy. The photoelectric\nemission is an instantaneous process and possesses certain special\nfeatures.\n\n3. Photoelectric current depends on (i) the intensity of incident light, (ii)\nthe potential difference applied between the two electrodes, and (iii)\nthe nature of the emitter material.\n\n4. The stopping potential (V\no\n) depends on (i) the frequency of incident\n\nlight, and (ii) the nature of the emitter material. For a given frequency\nof incident light, it is independent of its intensity. The stopping potential\nis directly related to the maximum kinetic energy of electrons emitted:\ne V\n\n0\n = (1/2) m v2\n\nmax\n = K\n\nmax\n.\n\n5. Below a certain frequency (threshold frequency) ν\n0\n, characteristic of\n\nthe metal, no photoelectric emission takes place, no matter how large\nthe intensity may be.\n\n6. The classical wave theory could not explain the main features of\nphotoelectric effect. Its picture of continuous absorption of energy from\nradiation could not explain the independence of K\n\nmax\n on intensity, the\n\nexistence of ν\no\n and the instantaneous nature of the process. Einstein\n\nexplained these features on the basis of photon picture of light.\nAccording to this, light is composed of discrete packets of energy called\nquanta or photons. Each photon carries an energy E (= h ν) and\nmomentum p (= h/λ), which depend on the frequency (ν ) of incident\nlight and not on its intensity. Photoelectric emission from the metal\nsurface occurs due to absorption of a photon by an electron.\n\n7. Einstein’s photoelectric equation is in accordance with the energy\nconservation law as applied to the photon absorption by an electron in\nthe metal. The maximum kinetic energy (1/2)m v2\n\nmax\n is equal to\n\nthe photon energy (hν ) minus the work function φ\n0 \n\n(= hν\n0\n) of the\n\ntarget metal:\n\n1\n2\n\nm v2\nmax\n\n = V\n0\n e = hν – φ\n\n0 \n= h (ν – ν\n\n0\n)\n\nThis photoelectric equation explains all the features of the photoelectric\neffect. Millikan’s first precise measurements confirmed the Einstein’s\nphotoelectric equation and obtained an accurate value of Planck’s\nconstant h . This led to the acceptance of particle or photon description\n(nature) of electromagnetic radiation, introduced by Einstein.\n\n8. Radiation has dual nature: wave and particle. The nature of experiment\ndetermines whether a wave or particle description is best suited for\nunderstanding the experimental result. Reasoning that radiation and\nmatter should be symmetrical in nature, Louis Victor de Broglie\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n406\n\nattributed a wave-like character to matter (material particles). The waves\nassociated with the moving material particles are called matter waves\nor de Broglie waves.\n\n 9. The de Broglie wavelength (λ) associated with a moving particle is related\nto its momentum p as:  λ = h/p. The dualism of matter is inherent in the\nde Broglie relation which contains a wave concept (λ) and a particle concept\n(p). The de Broglie wavelength is independent of the charge and nature of\nthe material  particle. It is significantly measurable (of the order of the\natomic-planes spacing in crystals) only in case of sub-atomic particles\nlike electrons, protons, etc. (due to smallness of their masses and hence,\nmomenta). However, it is indeed very small, quite beyond measurement,\nin case of macroscopic objects, commonly  encountered in everyday life.\n\n10. Electron diffraction experiments by Davisson and Germer, and by G. P.\nThomson, as well as many later experiments, have verified and confirmed\nthe wave-nature of electrons. The de Broglie hypothesis of matter waves\nsupports the Bohr’s concept of stationary orbits.\n\nPhysical Symbol Dimensions Unit Remarks\nQuantity\n\nPlanck’s h [ML2 T –1] J s E = hν\n\nconstant\n\nStopping V\n0\n\n[ML2 T –3A–1] V e V\n0\n= K\n\nmax\n\npotential\n\nWork φ\n0\n\n[ML2 T –2] J; eV K\nmax \n\n= E –φ\n0\n\nfunction\n\nThreshold ν\n0\n\n[T –1] Hz ν\n0 \n= φ\n\n0\n/h\n\nfrequency\n\nde Broglie λ [L] m λ= h/p\nwavelength\n\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n\n1. Free electrons in a metal are free in the sense that they move inside the\nmetal in a constant potential (This is only an approximation). They are\nnot free to move out of the metal. They need additional energy to get\nout of the metal.\n\n2. Free electrons in a metal do not all have the same energy. Like molecules\nin a gas jar, the electrons have a certain energy distribution at a given\ntemperature. This distribution is different from the usual Maxwell’s\ndistribution that you have learnt in the study of kinetic theory of gases.\nYou will learn about it in later courses, but the difference has to do\nwith the fact that electrons obey Pauli’s exclusion principle.\n\n3. Because of the energy distribution of free electrons in a metal, the\nenergy required by an electron to come out of the metal is different for\ndifferent electrons. Electrons with higher energy require less additional\nenergy to come out of the metal than those with lower energies. Work\nfunction is the least energy required by an electron to come out of the\nmetal.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n407\n\nDual Nature of Radiation\n\nand Matter\n\n4. Observations on photoelectric effect imply that in the event of matter-\nlight interaction, absorption of energy takes place in discrete units of hν.\nThis is not quite the same as saying that light consists of particles,\neach of energy hν.\n\n5. Observations on the stopping potential (its independence of intensity\nand dependence on frequency) are the crucial discriminator between\nthe wave-picture and photon-picture of photoelectric effect.\n\n6. The wavelength of a matter wave given by \nh\n\np\nλ =   has physical\n\nsignificance; its phase velocity  vp has no physical significance. However,\nthe group velocity of the matter wave is physically meaningful and\nequals the velocity of the particle.\n\nEXERCISES\n\n11.1 Find the\n(a) maximum frequency, and\n\n(b) minimum wavelength of X-rays produced by 30 kV electrons.\n\n11.2 The work function of caesium metal is 2.14 eV.

But systematic experiments were done by\nscientists since the dawn of the scientific and industrial era, about four centuries ago. Around the same time,\ntheoretical models about what light is made of were developed. While building a model in any branch of\nscience, it is essential to see that it is able to explain all the experimental observations existing at that time.\nIt is therefore appropriate to summarize some observations about light that were known in the seventeenth\ncentury.\n\nThe properties of light known at that time included (a) rectilinear propagation of light, (b) reflection from\nplane and curved surfaces, (c) refraction at the boundary of two media, (d) dispersion into various colours, (e)\nhigh speed. Appropriate laws were formulated for the first four phenomena. For example, Snell formulated his\nlaws of refraction in 1621. Several scientists right from the days of Galileo had tried to measure the speed of\nlight. But they had not been able to do so. They had only concluded that it was higher than the limit of their\nmeasurement.\n\nTwo models of light were also proposed in the seventeenth century. Descartes, in early decades of seventeenth\ncentury, proposed that light consists of particles, while Huygens, around 1650-60, proposed that light consists\nof waves. Descartes′ proposal was merely a philosophical model, devoid of any experiments or scientific\narguments. Newton soon after, around 1660-70, extended Descartes′ particle model, known as corpuscular\ntheory, built it up as a scientific theory, and explained various known properties with it. These models, light\nas waves and as particles, in a sense, are quite opposite of each other. But both models could explain all the\nknown properties of light. There was nothing to choose between them.\n\nThe history of the development of these models over the next few centuries is interesting. Bartholinus, in\n1669, discovered double refraction of light in some crystals, and Huygens, in 1678, was quick to explain it on\nthe basis of his wave theory of light. In spite of this, for over one hundred years, Newton’s particle model was\nfirmly believed and preferred over the wave model. This was partly because of its simplicity and partly because\nof Newton’s influence on contemporary physics.\n\nThen in 1801, Young performed his double-slit experiment and observed interference fringes. This\nphenomenon could be explained only by wave theory. It was realized that diffraction was also another\nphenomenon which could be explained only by wave theory. In fact, it was a natural consequence of Huygens\nidea of secondary wavelets emanating from every point in the path of light. These experiments could not be\nexplained by assuming that light consists of particles. Another phenomenon of polarisation was discovered\naround 1810, and this too could be naturally explained by the wave theory. Thus wave theory of Huygens\ncame to the forefront and Newton’s particle theory went into the background. This situation again continued\nfor almost a century.\n\nBetter experiments were performed in the nineteenth century to determine the speed of light. With more\naccurate experiments, a value of 3×108 m/s for speed of light in vacuum was arrived at. Around 1860, Maxwell\nproposed his equations of electromagnetism and it was realized that all electromagnetic phenomena known at\nthat time could be explained by Maxwell’s four equations. Soon Maxwell showed that electric and magnetic\nfields could propagate through empty space (vacuum) in the form of electromagnetic waves. He calculated the\nspeed of these waves and arrived at a theoretical value of 2.998×108  m/s. The close agreement of this value\nwith the experimental value suggested that light consists of electromagnetic waves. In 1887 Hertz demonstrated\nthe generation and detection of such waves. This established the wave theory of light on a firm footing. We\nmight say that while eighteenth century belonged to the particle model, the nineteenth century belonged to\nthe wave model of light.\n\nVast amounts of experiments were done during the period 1850-1900 on heat and related phenomena, an\naltogether different area of physics. Theories and models like kinetic theory and thermodynamics were developed\nwhich quite successfully explained the various phenomena, except one.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n413\n\nDual Nature of Radiation\n\nand Matter\n\nEvery body at any temperature emits radiation of all wavelengths. It also absorbs radiation falling on it.\nA body which absorbs all the radiation falling on it is called a black body. It is an ideal concept in physics, like\nconcepts of a point mass or uniform motion. A graph of the intensity of radiation emitted by a black body\nversus wavelength is called the black body spectrum. No theory in those days could explain the complete black\nbody spectrum!\n\nIn 1900, Planck hit upon a novel idea. If we assume, he said, that radiation is emitted in packets of energy\ninstead of continuously as in a wave, then we can explain the black body spectrum. Planck himself regarded\nthese quanta, or packets, as a property of emission and absorption, rather than that of light. He derived a\nformula which agreed with the entire spectrum. This was a confusing mixture of wave and particle pictures –\nradiation is emitted as a particle, it travels as a wave, and is again absorbed as a particle! Moreover, this put\nphysicists in a dilemma. Should we again accept the particle picture of light just to explain one phenomenon?\nThen what happens to the phenomena of interference and diffraction which cannot be explained by the\nparticle model?\n\nBut soon in 1905, Einstein explained the photoelectric effect by assuming the particle picture of light.\nIn 1907, Debye explained the low temperature specific heats of solids by using the particle picture for lattice\nvibrations in a crystalline solid. Both these phenomena belonging to widely diverse areas of physics could be\nexplained only by the particle model and not by the wave model. In 1923, Compton’s x-ray scattering experiments\nfrom atoms also went in favour of the particle picture. This increased the dilemma further.\n\nThus by 1923, physicists faced with the following situation. (a) There were some phenomena like rectilinear\npropagation, reflection, refraction, which could be explained by either particle model or by wave model. (b)\nThere were some phenomena such as diffraction and interference which could be explained only by the wave\nmodel but not by the particle model. (c) There were some phenomena such as black body radiation, photoelectric\neffect, and Compton scattering which could be explained only by the particle model but not by the wave model.\nSomebody in those days aptly remarked that light behaves as a particle on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays,\nand as a wave on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, and we don’t talk of light on Sundays!\n\nIn 1924, de Broglie proposed his theory of wave-particle duality in which he said that not only photons\nof light but also ‘particles’ of matter such as electrons and atoms possess a dual character, sometimes\nbehaving like a particle and sometimes as a wave. He gave a formula connecting their mass, velocity, momentum\n(particle characteristics), with their wavelength and frequency (wave characteristics)! In 1927 Thomson, and\nDavisson and Germer, in separate experiments, showed that electrons did behave like waves with a wavelength\nwhich agreed with that given by de Broglie’s formula. Their experiment was on diffraction of electrons through\ncrystalline solids, in which the regular arrangement of atoms acted like a grating. Very soon, diffraction\nexperiments with other ‘particles’ such as neutrons and protons were performed and these too confirmed with\nde Broglie’s formula. This confirmed wave-particle duality as an established principle of physics. Here was a\nprinciple, physicists thought, which explained all the phenomena mentioned above not only for light but also\nfor the so-called particles.\n\nBut there was no basic theoretical foundation for wave-particle duality. De Broglie’s proposal was\nmerely a qualitative argument based on symmetry of nature. Wave-particle duality was at best a principle, not\nan outcome of a sound fundamental theory. It is true that all experiments whatever agreed with de Broglie\nformula. But physics does not work that way. On the one hand, it needs experimental confirmation, while on\nthe other hand, it also needs sound theoretical basis for the models proposed. This was developed over the\nnext two decades. Dirac developed his theory of radiation in about 1928, and Heisenberg and Pauli gave it a\nfirm footing by 1930. Tomonaga, Schwinger, and Feynman, in late 1940s, produced further refinements and\ncleared the theory of inconsistencies which were noticed. All these theories mainly put wave-particle duality\non a theoretical footing.\n\nAlthough the story continues, it grows more and more complex and beyond the scope of this note. But\nwe have here the essential structure of what happened, and let us be satisfied with it at the moment. Now it\nis regarded as a natural consequence of present theories of physics that electromagnetic radiation as well as\nparticles of matter exhibit both wave and particle properties in different experiments, and sometimes even in\nthe different parts of the same experiment.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n\n')('status', 200)
