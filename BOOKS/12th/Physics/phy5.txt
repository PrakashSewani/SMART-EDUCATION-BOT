Vast, distant galaxies, the\n\ntiny invisible atoms, humans and beasts all are permeated through and\n\nthrough with a host of magnetic fields from a variety of sources. The earth’s\n\nmagnetism predates human evolution. The word magnet is derived from\n\nthe name of an island in Greece called magnesia where magnetic ore\n\ndeposits were found, as early as 600 BC. Shepherds on this island\n\ncomplained that their wooden shoes (which had nails) at times stayed\n\nstruck to the ground. Their iron-tipped rods were similarly affected. This\n\nattractive property of magnets made it difficult for them to move around.\n\nThe directional property of magnets was also known since ancient\n\ntimes. A thin long piece of a magnet, when suspended freely, pointed in\n\nthe north-south direction. A similar effect was observed when it was placed\n\non a piece of cork which was then allowed to float in still water. The name\n\nlodestone (or loadstone) given to a naturally occurring ore of iron-\n\nmagnetite means leading stone. The technological exploitation of this\n\nproperty is generally credited to the Chinese. Chinese texts dating 400\n\nBC mention the use of magnetic needles for navigation on ships. Caravans\n\ncrossing the Gobi desert also employed magnetic needles.\n\nA Chinese legend narrates the tale of the victory of the emperor Huang-ti\n\nabout four thousand years ago, which he owed to his craftsmen (whom\n\nChapter Five\n\nMAGNETISM AND\n\nMATTER\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n174\n\nnowadays you would call engineers). These ‘engineers’\n\nbuilt a chariot on which they placed a magnetic figure\n\nwith arms outstretched. Figure 5.1 is an artist’s\n\ndescription of this chariot. The figure swiveled around\n\nso that the finger of the statuette on it always pointed\n\nsouth. With this chariot, Huang-ti’s troops were able\n\nto attack the enemy from the rear in thick fog, and to\n\ndefeat them.\n\nIn the previous chapter we have learned that moving\n\ncharges or electric currents produce magnetic fields.\n\nThis discovery, which was made in the early part of the\n\nnineteenth century is credited to Oersted, Ampere, Biot\n\nand Savart, among others.\n\nIn the present chapter, we take a look at magnetism\n\nas a subject in its own right.\n\nSome of the commonly known ideas regarding\n\nmagnetism are:\n\n(i) The earth behaves as a magnet with the magnetic\n\nfield pointing approximately from the geographic\n\nsouth to the north.\n\n(ii) When a bar magnet is freely suspended, it points in  the north-south\n\ndirection. The tip which points to the geographic north is called the\n\nnorth pole and the tip which points to the geographic south is called\n\nthe south pole of the magnet.\n\n(iii) There is a repulsive force when north poles ( or south poles ) of two\n\nmagnets are brought close together. Conversely, there is an attractive\n\nforce between the north pole of one magnet and the south pole of\n\nthe other.\n\n(iv) We cannot isolate the north, or south pole of a magnet. If a bar magnet\n\nis broken into two halves, we get two similar bar magnets with\n\nsomewhat weaker properties. Unlike electric charges, isolated magnetic\n\nnorth and south poles known as magnetic monopoles do not exist.\n\n(v) It is possible to make magnets out of iron and its alloys.\n\nWe begin with a description of a bar magnet and its behaviour in an\n\nexternal magnetic field. We describe Gauss’s law of magnetism. We then\n\nfollow it up with an account of the earth’s magnetic field. We next describe\n\nhow materials can be classified on the basis of their magnetic properties.\n\nWe describe para-, dia-, and ferromagnetism. We conclude with a section\n\non electromagnets and permanent magnets.\n\n5.2  THE BAR MAGNET\nOne of the earliest childhood memories of the famous physicist Albert\n\nEinstein was that of a magnet gifted to him by a relative. Einstein was\n\nfascinated, and played endlessly with it. He wondered how the magnet\n\ncould affect objects such as nails or pins placed away from it and not in\n\nany way connected to it by a spring or string.\n\nFIGURE 5.1 The arm of the statuette\n\nmounted on the chariot always points\nsouth. This is an artist’s sketch of one\n\nof the earliest known compasses,\n\nthousands of years old.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nMagnetism and\n\nMatter\n\n175\n\nWe begin our study by examining iron filings sprinkled on a sheet of\nglass placed over a short bar magnet. The arrangement of iron filings is\n\nshown in Fig. 5.2.\n The pattern of iron filings suggests that the magnet has two poles\n\nsimilar to the positive and negative charge of an electric dipole. As\n\nmentioned in the introductory section, one pole is designated the North\npole and the other, the South pole. When suspended freely, these poles\npoint approximately towards the geographic north and south poles,\n\nrespectively. A similar pattern of iron filings is observed around a current\ncarrying solenoid.\n\n5.2.1  The magnetic field lines\n\nThe pattern of iron filings permits us to plot the magnetic field lines*. This is\n\nshown both for the bar-magnet and the current-carrying solenoid in\nFig. 5.3. For comparison refer to the Chapter 1, Figure 1.17(d). Electric field\nlines of an electric dipole are also displayed in Fig. 5.3(c). The magnetic field\n\nlines are a visual and intuitive realisation of the magnetic field. Their\nproperties are:\n(i) The magnetic field lines of a magnet (or a solenoid) form continuous\n\nclosed loops. This is unlike the electric dipole where these field lines\nbegin from a positive charge and end on the negative charge or escape\nto infinity.\n\n(ii) The tangent to the field line at a given point represents the direction of\nthe net magnetic field B at that point.\n\nFIGURE 5.2 The\n\narrangement of iron\nfilings surrounding a\n\nbar magnet. The\n\npattern mimics\nmagnetic field lines.\nThe pattern suggests\n\nthat the bar magnet\nis a magnetic dipole.\n\n* In some textbooks the magnetic field lines are called magnetic lines of force.\nThis nomenclature is avoided since it can be confusing. Unlike electrostatics\n\nthe field lines in magnetism do not indicate the direction of the force on a\n\n(moving) charge.\n\nFIGURE 5.3 The field lines of (a) a bar magnet, (b) a current-carrying finite solenoid and\n(c) electric dipole. At large distances, the field lines are very similar. The curves\n\nlabelled  i  and ii are closed Gaussian surfaces.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n176\n\n(iii) The larger the number of field lines crossing per unit area, the stronger\nis the magnitude of the magnetic field B. In Fig. 5.3(a), B is larger\n\naround region  ii  than in region  i  .\n(iv) The magnetic field lines do not intersect, for if they did, the direction\n\nof the magnetic field would not be unique at the point of intersection.\n\nOne can plot the magnetic field lines in a variety of ways. One way is\nto place a small magnetic compass needle at various positions and note\nits orientation. This gives us an idea of the magnetic field direction at\n\nvarious points in space.\n\n5.2.2  Bar magnet as an equivalent solenoid\n\nIn the previous chapter, we have explained how a current loop acts as a\nmagnetic dipole (Section 4.10). We mentioned Ampere’s hypothesis that\n\nall magnetic phenomena can be explained in terms of circulating currents.\nRecall that the magnetic dipole moment m\nassociated with a current loop was defined\n\nto be m = NI A where N is the number of\nturns in the loop, I the current and A the\narea vector (Eq. 4.30).\n\nThe resemblance of magnetic field lines\nfor a bar magnet and a solenoid suggest that\na bar magnet may be thought of as a large\n\nnumber of circulating currents in analogy\nwith a solenoid. Cutting a bar magnet in half\nis like cutting a solenoid. We get two smaller\n\nsolenoids with weaker magnetic properties.\nThe field lines remain continuous, emerging\nfrom one face of the solenoid and entering\n\ninto the other face. One can test this analogy\nby moving a small compass needle in the\nneighbourhood of a bar magnet and a\n\ncurrent-carrying finite solenoid and noting\nthat the deflections of the needle are similar\nin both cases.\n\nTo make this analogy more firm we\n\ncalculate the axial field of a finite solenoid\n\ndepicted in Fig. 5.4 (a). We shall demonstrate\n\nthat at large distances this axial field\n\nresembles that of a bar magnet.\n\nLet the solenoid of Fig. 5.4(a) consists of\n\nn turns per unit length. Let its length be 2l\n\nand radius a. We can evaluate the axial field\n\nat a point P, at a distance r from the centre O\n\nof the solenoid. To do this, consider a circular element of thickness dx of\n\nthe solenoid at a distance x from its centre. It consists of n dx turns. Let I\n\nbe the current in the solenoid. In Section 4.6 of the previous chapter we\n\nhave calculated the magnetic field on the axis of a circular current loop.\n\nFrom Eq. (4.13), the magnitude of the field at point P due to the circular\n\nelement is\n\nFIGURE 5.4 Calculation of (a) The axial field of a\nfinite solenoid in order to demonstrate its similarity\n\nto that of a bar magnet. (b) A magnetic needle\nin a uniform magnetic field B. The\n\narrangement may be used to\n\ndetermine either B or the magnetic\nmoment m of the needle.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nMagnetism and\n\nMatter\n\n177\n\ndB\nndx Ia\n\nr x a\n=\n\n− +\n\nµ0\n2\n\n2 22\n3\n\n2[( ) ]\n\nThe magnitude of the total field is obtained by summing over all the\nelements — in other words by integrating from x = – l to x = + l . Thus,\n\n2\n0\n\n2\n\nnIa\nB\n\nµ\n=\n\ndx\n\nr x al\n\nl\n\n[( ) ]\n/− +−∫ 2 2 3 2\n\nThis integration can be done by trigonometric substitutions. This\nexercise, however, is not necessary for our purpose. Note that the range\nof x is from  – l to + l . Consider the far axial field of the solenoid, i.e.,\n\nr >> a and r >> l . Then the denominator is approximated by\n\n3\n2 2 32[( ) ]r x a r− + ≈\n\nand B\nn I a\n\nr\ndx\n\nl\n\nl\n\n=\n−\n∫\n\nµ0\n2\n\n3\n2\n\n      =  \n2\n\n0\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\nn I l a\n\nr\n\nµ\n (5.1)\n\nNote that the magnitude of the magnetic moment of the solenoid is,\nm = n (2 l) I (πa2) — (total number of turns × current × cross-sectional\narea). Thus,\n\n0\n\n3\n\n2\n\n4\n\nm\nB\n\nr\n\nµ\nπ\n\n= (5.2)\n\nThis is also the far axial magnetic field of a bar magnet which one may\n\nobtain experimentally. Thus, a bar magnet and a solenoid produce similar\n\nmagnetic fields. The magnetic moment of a bar magnet is thus equal to\n\nthe magnetic moment of an equivalent solenoid that produces the same\n\nmagnetic field.\n\nSome textbooks assign a magnetic charge (also called pole strength)\n\n+q\nm\nto the north pole and –q\n\nm\n to the south pole of a bar magnet of length\n\n2l , and magnetic moment q\nm\n(2l). The field strength due to q\n\nm\n at a distance\n\nr from it is given by µ\n0\nq\n\nm\n/4πr2. The magnetic field due to the bar magnet\n\nis then obtained, both for the axial and the equatorial case, in a manner\n\nanalogous to that of an electric dipole (Chapter 1). The method is simple\n\nand appealing. However, magnetic monopoles do not exist, and we have\n\navoided this approach for that reason.\n\n5.2.3  The dipole in a uniform magnetic field\n\nThe pattern of iron filings, i.e., the magnetic field lines gives us an\napproximate idea of the magnetic field B. We may at times be required to\ndetermine the magnitude of B accurately. This is done by placing a small\n\ncompass needle of known magnetic moment m and moment of inertia IIIII\nand allowing it to oscillate in the magnetic field. This arrangement is shown\nin Fig. 5.4(b).\n\nThe torque on the needle is [see Eq. (4.29)],\n\nτττττ = m × B (5.3)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n178  E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 5\n\n.1\n\nIn magnitude τ = mB sinθ\nHere τττττ  is restoring torque and θ is the angle between m and B.\n\nTherefore, in equilibrium \n2\n\n2\nsin\n\nθ\nθ= −\n\nd\nmB\n\ndt\nI\n\nNegative sign with mB sinθ implies that restoring torque is in opposition\nto deflecting torque. For small values of θ in radians, we approximate\nsin θ ≈ θ  and get\n\n2\n\n2\n–\n\nθ\nθ≈\n\nd\nmB\n\ndt\nI\n\nor,  \n2\n\n2\n\nθ\nθ= −\n\nd mB\n\ndt I\nThis represents a simple harmonic motion. The square of the angular\n\nfrequency is ω2 = mB/I and the time period is,\n\n2π=T\nmB\n\nI\n(5.4)\n\nor     \n4\n\n2\n\n2\n\nπ\n=B\n\nm T\n\nI\n(5.5)\n\nAn expression for magnetic potential energy can also be obtained on\n\nlines similar to  electrostatic potential energy.\nThe magnetic potential energy U\n\nm\n is given by\n\nU dm = ∫ τ θ θ( )\n\n      = = −∫mB d mBsin cosθ θ θ\n      = −m B. (5.6)\nWe have emphasised in Chapter 2 that the zero of potential energy\n\ncan be fixed at one’s convenience. Taking the constant of integration to be\nzero means fixing the zero of potential energy at θ = 90°, i.e., when the\nneedle is perpendicular to the field. Equation (5.6) shows that potential\nenergy is minimum (= –mB) at θ = 0° (most stable position) and maximum\n(= +mB) at θ = 180° (most unstable position).\n\nExample 5.1 In Fig. 5.4(b), the magnetic needle has magnetic moment\n6.7 × 10\n\n–2\n Am\n\n2\n and moment of inertia I = 7.5 × 10\n\n–6 \nkg m\n\n2\n.

(a) What is\n\nthe magnetic moment of the magnet? (b) What is the work done in\nmoving it from its most stable to most unstable position? (c) The bar\nmagnet is replaced by a solenoid of cross-sectional area 2 × 10–4 m2\n\nand 1000 turns, but of the same magnetic moment. Determine the\ncurrent flowing through the solenoid.\n\nSolution\n\n(a) From Eq.

An iron nail near a bar magnet, however,\n\nexperiences a force of attraction in addition to a torque. Why?\n(c) Must every magnetic configuration have a north pole and a south\n\npole? What about the field due to a toroid?\n\n(d) Two identical looking iron bars A and B are given, one of which is\ndefinitely known to be magnetised. (We do not know which one.)\nHow would one ascertain whether or not both are magnetised? If\n\nonly one is magnetised, how does one ascertain which one?  [Use\nnothing else but the bars A and B.]\n\nSolution\n(a) In either case, one gets two magnets, each with a north and south\n\npole.\n(b) No force if the field is uniform. The iron nail experiences a non-\n\nuniform field due to the bar magnet. There is induced magnetic\nmoment in the nail, therefore, it experiences both force and torque.\nThe net force is attractive because the induced south pole (say) in\nthe nail is closer to the north pole of magnet than induced north\npole.\n\n(c) Not necessarily. True only if the source of the field has a net non-\nzero magnetic moment. This is not so for a toroid or even for a\nstraight infinite conductor.\n\n(d) Try to bring different ends of the bars closer. A repulsive force in\nsome situation establishes that both are magnetised. If it is always\nattractive, then one of them is not magnetised. In a bar magnet\nthe intensity of the magnetic field is the strongest at the two ends\n(poles) and weakest at the central region. This fact may be used to\ndetermine whether A or B is the magnet.

If you do not notice any change from the\n\nend to the middle of B, then A is magnetised.\n\n5.2.4  The electrostatic analog\n\nComparison of Eqs. (5.2), (5.3) and (5.6) with the corresponding equations\n\nfor electric dipole (Chapter 1), suggests that magnetic field at large\ndistances due to a bar magnet of magnetic moment m can be obtained\nfrom the equation for electric field due to an electric dipole of dipole moment\n\np, by making the following replacements:\n\n→E B , p m→→→→ , \n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n4 4\n\nµ\nε\n\n→\nπ π\n\nIn particular, we can write down the equatorial field (B\nE\n) of a bar magnet\n\nat a distance r, for r >> l, where l is the size of the magnet:\n\n0\n\n3\n4\n\nE\nr\n\nµ\n= −\n\nπ\n\nm\nB (5.7)\n\nLikewise, the axial field (B\nA\n) of a bar magnet for r >> l is:\n\n0\n\n3\n\n2\n\n4\nA\n\nr\n\nµ\n=\n\nπ\n\nm\nB (5.8)\n\nEquation (5.8) is just Eq.

In Fig 5.3(c), we\n\nsee that for a closed surface represented by  i , the number of lines leaving\n\nthe surface is equal to the number of lines entering it. This is consistent\n\nwith the fact that no net charge is enclosed by the surface. However, in\n\nthe same figure, for the closed surface ii , there is a net outward flux, since\n\nit does include a net (positive) charge.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n182  E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 5\n\n.6\n\nThe situation is radically different for magnetic fields\nwhich are continuous and form closed loops. Examine the\n\nGaussian surfaces represented by  i  or  ii  in Fig 5.3(a) or\nFig. 5.3(b). Both cases visually demonstrate that the\nnumber of magnetic field lines leaving the surface is\n\nbalanced by the number of lines entering it. The net\nmagnetic flux is zero for both the surfaces. This is true\nfor any closed surface.\n\nFIGURE 5.6\n\nConsider a small vector area element ∆S of a closed\nsurface S as in Fig. 5.6. The magnetic flux through ÄS is\ndefined as ∆φ\n\nB\n = B.∆S, where B is the field  at ∆S. We divide\n\nS into many small area elements and calculate the\nindividual flux through each. Then, the net flux φ\n\nB\n is,\n\nφ φB B\nall all\n\n= = =∑ ∑∆ ∆\n’ ’ ’ ’\n\nB S. 0 (5.9)\n\nwhere ‘all’ stands for ‘all area elements ∆S′. Compare this\nwith the Gauss’s law of electrostatics. The flux through a closed surface\nin that case is given by\n\nE S.∆ =∑\nq\n\nε0\nwhere q is the electric charge enclosed by the surface.\n\nThe difference between the Gauss’s law of magnetism and that for\n\nelectrostatics is a reflection of the fact that isolated magnetic poles (also\ncalled monopoles) are not known to exist. There are no sources or sinks\nof B; the simplest magnetic element is a dipole or a current loop. All\n\nmagnetic phenomena can be explained in terms of an arrangement of\ndipoles and/or current loops.\nThus, Gauss’s law for magnetism is:\n\nThe net magnetic flux through any closed surface is zero.\n\nExample 5.6  Many of the diagrams given in Fig. 5.7 show magnetic\nfield lines (thick lines in the figure) wrongly.

Magnetic field lines can never emanate from a point, as\nshown in figure. Over any closed surface, the net flux of B must\nalways be zero, i.e., pictorially as many field lines should seem to\n\nenter the surface as the number of lines leaving it. The field lines\nshown, in fact, represent electric field of a long positively charged\nwire. The correct magnetic field lines are circling the straight\n\nconductor, as described in Chapter 4.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n184  \nE\n\nX\nA\n\nM\nP\nL\nE\n 5\n\n.7\n E\n\nX\nA\n\nM\nP\nL\nE\n 5\n\n.6\n\n(b) Wrong. Magnetic field lines (like electric field lines) can never cross\neach other, because otherwise the direction of field at the point of\nintersection is ambiguous. There is further error in the figure.\nMagnetostatic field lines can never form closed loops around empty\nspace. A closed loop of static magnetic field line must enclose a\nregion across which a current is passing. By contrast, electrostatic\nfield lines can never form closed loops, neither in empty space,\nnor when the loop encloses charges.\n\n(c) Right. Magnetic lines are completely confined within a toroid.\nNothing wrong here in field lines forming closed loops, since each\nloop encloses a region across which a current passes. Note, for\nclarity of figure, only a few field lines within the toroid have been\nshown. Actually, the entire region enclosed by the windings\ncontains magnetic field.\n\n(d) Wrong. Field lines due to a solenoid at its ends and outside cannot\nbe so completely straight and confined; such a thing violates\nAmpere’s law. The lines should curve out at both ends, and meet\neventually to form closed loops.\n\n(e) Right. These are field lines outside and inside a bar magnet. Note\ncarefully the direction of field lines inside. Not all field lines emanate\nout of a north pole (or converge into a south pole). Around both\nthe N-pole, and the S-pole, the net flux of the field is zero.\n\n(f ) Wrong. These field lines cannot possibly represent a magnetic field.\nLook at the upper region. All the field lines seem to emanate out of\nthe shaded plate. The net flux through a surface surrounding the\nshaded plate is not zero. This is impossible for a magnetic field.\nThe given field lines, in fact, show the electrostatic field lines\naround a positively charged upper plate and a negatively charged\nlower plate. The difference between Fig. [5.7(e) and (f )]  should be\ncarefully grasped.\n\n(g) Wrong. Magnetic field lines between two pole pieces cannot be\nprecisely straight at the ends. Some fringing of lines is inevitable.\nOtherwise, Ampere’s law is violated. This is also true for electric\nfield lines.\n\nExample 5.7\n\n(a) Magnetic field lines show the direction (at every point) along which\na small magnetised needle aligns (at the point). Do the magnetic\nfield lines also represent the lines of force on a moving charged\n\nparticle at every point?\n(b) Magnetic field lines can be entirely confined within the core of a\n\ntoroid, but not within a straight solenoid. Why?\n\n(c) If magnetic monopoles existed, how would the Gauss’s law of\nmagnetism be modified?\n\n(d) Does a bar magnet exert a torque on itself due to its own field?\n\nDoes one element of a current-carrying wire exert a force on another\nelement of the same wire?\n\n(e) Magnetic field arises due to charges in motion. Can a system have\n\nmagnetic moments even though its net charge is zero?\n\nSolution\n(a) No. The magnetic force is always normal to B (remember magnetic\n\nforce = qv × B). It is misleading to call magnetic field lines as lines\nof force.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nMagnetism and\n\nMatter\n\n185\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 5\n\n.7\n\n(b) If field lines were entirely confined between two ends of a straight\nsolenoid, the flux through the cross-section at each end would be\nnon-zero. But the flux of field B through any closed surface must\n\nalways be zero. For a toroid, this difficulty is absent because it\nhas no ‘ends’.\n\n(c) Gauss’s law of magnetism states that the flux of B through any\n\nclosed surface is always zero B s.∆ =∫ 0s .\nIf monopoles existed, the right hand side would be equal to the\nmonopole (magnetic charge) q\n\nm\n enclosed by S. [Analogous to\n\nGauss’s law of electrostatics, B s.∆ =∫ µ0qmS  where qm is the\n(monopole) magnetic charge enclosed by S .]\n\n(d) No. There is no force or torque on an element due to the field\nproduced by that element itself. But there is a force (or torque) on\nan element of the same wire. (For the special case of a straight\n\nwire, this force is zero.)\n\n(e) Yes. The average of the charge in the system may be zero. Yet, the\n\nmean of the magnetic moments due to various current loops may\nnot be zero. We will come across such examples in connection\nwith paramagnetic material where atoms have net dipole moment\n\nthrough their net charge is zero.\n\n5.4  THE EARTH’S MAGNETISM\nEarlier we have referred to the magnetic field of the earth. The strength of\n\nthe earth’s magnetic field varies from place to place on the earth’s surface;\n\nits value being of the order of 10\n–5\n\n T.\n\nWhat causes the earth to have a magnetic field is not clear. Originally\n\nthe magnetic field was thought of as arising from a giant bar magnet\n\nplaced approximately along the axis of rotation of the earth and deep in\n\nthe interior. However, this simplistic picture is certainly not correct. The\n\nmagnetic field is now thought to arise due to electrical currents produced\n\nby convective motion of metallic fluids (consisting mostly of molten\n\niron and nickel) in the outer core of the earth. This is known as the\n\ndynamo effect.\n\nThe magnetic field lines of the earth resemble that of a (hypothetical)\n\nmagnetic dipole located at the centre of the earth. The axis of the dipole\n\ndoes not coincide with the axis of rotation of the earth but is presently\n\ntitled by approximately 11.3° with respect to the later. In this way of looking\n\nat it, the magnetic poles are located where the magnetic field lines due to\n\nthe dipole enter or leave the earth. The location of the north magnetic pole\n\nis at a latitude of 79.74° N and a longitude of 71.8° W, a place somewhere\n\nin north Canada. The magnetic south pole is at 79.74° S, 108.22° E in\n\nthe Antarctica.\n\nThe pole near the geographic north pole of the earth is called the north\n\nmagnetic pole. Likewise, the pole near the geographic south pole is called\n\nG\ne\no\nm\n\na\ng\nn\n\ne\nt\nic\n\n fie\nld\n\n fr\ne\nq\n\nu\ne\nn\n\nt\nly\n\n a\ns\nk\ne\nd\n\n q\nu\n\ne\ns\nt\nio\n\nn\ns\n\nh\nttp\n\n://w\nw\n\nw\n.n\n\ng\nd\nc\n.n\n\no\na\na\n.g\n\no\nv\n/g\n\ne\no\nm\n\na\ng\n/\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n186\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 5\n\n.8\n\nthe south magnetic pole. There is some confusion in the\n\nnomenclature of the poles. If one looks at the magnetic\n\nfield lines of the earth (Fig. 5.8), one sees that unlike in the\ncase of a bar magnet, the field lines go into the earth at the\n\nnorth magnetic pole (N\nm\n\n) and come out from the south\nmagnetic pole (S\n\nm\n). The convention arose because the\n\nmagnetic north was the direction to which the north\n\npole of a magnetic needle pointed; the north pole of\na magnet was so named as it was the north seeking\npole. Thus, in reality, the north magnetic pole behaves\n\nlike the south pole of a bar magnet inside the earth and\nvice versa.\n\nExample 5.8 The earth’s magnetic field at the equator is approximately\n0.4 G. Estimate the earth’s dipole moment.\n\nSolution From Eq. (5.7), the equatorial magnetic field is,\n\n0\n\n3\n4\n\nE\n\nm\nB\n\nr\n\nµ\n=\n\nπ\n\nWe are given that B\nE\n ~ 0.4 G = 4 × 10\n\n–5 \nT. For r, we take the radius of\n\nthe earth 6.4 × 10\n6\n m. Hence,\n\n5 6 3\n\n0\n\n4 10 (6.4 10 )\n\n/4\nm\n\nµ\n\n−× × ×\n=\n\nπ\n=4 × 10\n\n2 \n× (6.4 × 10\n\n6\n)\n3\n    (µ\n\n0\n/4π = 10–7)\n\n= 1.05 × 10\n23\n\n A m\n2\n\nThis is close to the value 8 × 10\n22\n\n A m\n2 \n\n quoted in geomagnetic texts.\n\n 5.4.1  Magnetic declination and dip\n\nConsider a point on the earth’s surface. At such a point, the direction of\n\nthe longitude circle determines the geographic north-south direction, the\n\nline of longitude towards the north pole being the direction of\n\ntrue north. The vertical plane containing the longitude circle\n\nand the axis of rotation of the earth is called the geographic\n\nmeridian. In a similar way, one can define magnetic meridian\n\nof a place as the vertical plane which passes through the\n\nimaginary line joining the magnetic north and the south poles.\n\nThis plane would intersect the surface of the earth in a\n\nlongitude like circle. A magnetic needle, which is free to swing\n\nhorizontally, would then lie in the magnetic meridian and the\n\nnorth pole of the needle would point towards the magnetic\n\nnorth pole. Since the line joining the magnetic poles is titled\n\nwith respect to the geographic axis of the earth, the magnetic\n\nmeridian at a point makes angle with the geographic meridian.\n\nThis, then, is the angle between the true geographic north and\n\nthe north shown by a compass needle. This angle is called the\n\nmagnetic declination or simply declination (Fig. 5.9).\n\nThe declination is greater at higher latitudes and smaller\n\nnear the equator. The declination in India is small, it being\n\nFIGURE 5.8 The earth as a giant\nmagnetic dipole.\n\nFIGURE 5.9 A magnetic needle\n\nfree to move in horizontal plane,\npoints toward the magnetic\n\nnorth-south\n\ndirection.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nMagnetism and\n\nMatter\n\n187\n\n0°41′ E at Delhi and 0°58′ W at Mumbai. Thus, at both these places a\nmagnetic needle shows the true north quite accurately.\n\nThere is one more quantity of interest. If a magnetic needle is perfectly\n\nbalanced about a horizontal axis so that it can swing in a plane of the\nmagnetic meridian, the needle would make an angle with the horizontal\n(Fig. 5.10). This is known as the angle of dip (also known as inclination).\n\nThus, dip is the angle that the total magnetic field B\nE\n of the earth makes\n\nwith the surface of the earth. Figure 5.11 shows the magnetic meridian\nplane at a point P on the surface of the earth. The plane is a section through\n\nthe earth. The total magnetic field at P\ncan be resolved into a horizontal\ncomponent H\n\nE\n and a vertical\n\ncomponent Z\nE\n. The angle that B\n\nE\n makes\n\nwith H\nE\n is the angle of dip, I.\n\nIn most of the northern hemisphere, the north pole of the dip needle\n\ntilts downwards. Likewise in most of the southern hemisphere, the south\npole of the dip needle tilts downwards.\n\nTo describe the magnetic field of the earth at a point on its surface, we\n\nneed to specify three quantities, viz., the declination D, the angle of dip or\nthe inclination I and the horizontal component of the earth’s field H\n\nE\n. These\n\nare known as the element of the earth’s magnetic field.\n\nRepresenting the verticle component by Z\nE\n, we have\n\nZ\nE\n = B\n\nE\n sinI [5.10(a)]\n\nH\nE\n = B\n\nE\n cosI [5.10(b)]\n\nwhich gives,\n\ntan E\n\nE\n\nZ\nI\n\nH\n= [5.10(c)]\n\nFIGURE 5.10 The circle is a\nsection through the earth\n\ncontaining the magnetic\nmeridian. The angle between B\n\nE\n\nand the horizontal component\n\nH\nE\n is the angle of dip.\n\nFIGURE 5.11 The earth’s\nmagnetic field, B\n\nE\n, its horizontal\n\nand vertical components, H\nE\n and\n\nZ\nE\n.

When the\ncompass is held level, it points along the direction of the horizontal component of the earth’s\n\nmagnetic field at the location. Thus, the compass needle would stay along the magnetic\nmeridian of the place. In some places on the earth there are deposits of magnetic minerals\nwhich cause the compass needle to deviate from the magnetic meridian. Knowing the magnetic\n\ndeclination at a place allows us to correct the compass to determine the direction of true\nnorth.\n\nSo what happens if we take our compass to the magnetic pole? At the poles, the magnetic\n\nfield lines are converging or diverging vertically so that the horizontal component is negligible.\nIf the needle is only capable of moving in a horizontal plane, it can point along any direction,\nrendering it useless as a direction finder. What one needs in such a case is a dip needle\n\nwhich is a compass pivoted to move in a vertical plane containing the magnetic field of the\nearth. The needle of the compass then shows the angle which the magnetic field makes with\nthe vertical. At the magnetic poles such a needle will point straight down.\n\nExample 5.9 In the magnetic meridian of a certain place, the\n\nhorizontal component of the earth’s magnetic field is 0.26G and the\ndip angle is 60°. What is the magnetic field of the earth at this location?\n\nSolution\n\nIt is given that H\nE\n = 0.26 G.

One would like to classify the magnetic properties of these\nsubstances. In the present section, we define and explain certain terms\nwhich will help us to carry out this exercise.\n\nWe have seen that a circulating electron in an atom has a magnetic\nmoment. In a bulk material, these moments add up vectorially and they\ncan give a net magnetic moment which is non-zero. We define\n\nmagnetisation M of a sample to be equal to its net magnetic moment per\nunit volume:\n\nnet\n\nV\n=\n\nm\nM (5.11)\n\nM is a vector with dimensions L–1 A and is measured in a units of A m–1.\n\nConsider a long solenoid of n turns per unit length and carrying a\ncurrent I. The magnetic field in the interior of the solenoid was shown to\nbe given by\n\nEARTH’S MAGNETIC FIELD\n\nIt must not be assumed that there is a giant bar magnet deep inside the earth which is\ncausing the earth’s magnetic field. Although there are large deposits of iron inside the earth,\n\nit is highly unlikely that a large solid block of iron stretches from the magnetic north pole to\nthe magnetic south pole. The earth’s core is very hot and molten, and the ions of iron and\nnickel are responsible for earth’s magnetism. This hypothesis seems very probable. Moon,\n\nwhich has no molten core, has no magnetic field, Venus has a slower rate of rotation, and a\nweaker magnetic field, while Jupiter, which has the fastest rotation rate among planets, has\na fairly strong magnetic field. However, the precise mode of these circulating currents and\n\nthe energy needed to sustain them are not very well understood. These are several open\nquestions which form an important area of continuing research.\n\nThe variation of the earth’s magnetic field with position is also an  interesting area of\n\nstudy. Charged particles emitted by the sun flow towards the earth and beyond, in a stream\ncalled the solar wind. Their motion is affected by the earth’s magnetic field, and in turn, they\naffect the pattern of the earth’s magnetic field. The pattern of magnetic field near the poles is\n\nquite different from that in other regions of the earth.\nThe variation of earth’s magnetic field with time is no less  fascinating. There are short\n\nterm variations taking place over centuries and long term variations taking place over a\n\nperiod of a million years. In a span of 240 years from 1580 to 1820 AD, over which records\nare available, the magnetic declination at London has been found to change by 3.5°,\nsuggesting that the magnetic poles inside the earth change position with time. On the scale\n\nof a million years, the earth’s magnetic fields has been found to reverse its direction. Basalt\ncontains iron, and basalt is emitted during volcanic activity. The little iron magnets inside it\nalign themselves parallel to the magnetic field at that place as the basalt cools and solidifies.\n\nGeological studies of basalt containing such pieces of magnetised region have provided\nevidence for the change of direction of earth’s magnetic field, several times in the past.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n190\n\nB\n0\n = µ\n\n0\n nI (5.12)\n\nIf the interior of the solenoid is filled with a material with non-zero\n\nmagnetisation, the field inside the solenoid will be greater than B\n0\n. The\n\nnet B field in the interior of the solenoid may be expressed as\n\nB = B\n0\n + B\n\nm\n(5.13)\n\nwhere B\nm\n is the field contributed by the material core. It turns out that\n\nthis additional field B\nm\n is proportional to the magnetisation M of the\n\nmaterial and is expressed as\n\nB\nm\n = µ\n\n0\nM (5.14)\n\nwhere µ\n0\n is the same constant (permittivity of vacuum) that appears in\n\nBiot-Savart’s law.\nIt is convenient to introduce another vector field H, called the magnetic\n\nintensity, which is defined by\n\n0\n\n–\nµ\n\n=\nB\n\nH M (5.15)\n\nwhere H has the same dimensions as M and is measured in units of A m–1.\n\nThus, the total magnetic field B is written as\n\nB = µ\n0\n (H + M) (5.16)\n\nWe repeat our defining procedure. We have partitioned the contribution\n\nto the total magnetic field inside the sample into two parts: one, due to\n\nexternal factors such as the current in the solenoid. This is represented\n\nby H. The other is due to the specific nature of the magnetic material,\n\nnamely M. The latter quantity can be influenced by external factors. This\n\ninfluence is mathematically expressed as\n\nχ=M H (5.17)\n\nwhere χ , a dimensionless quantity, is appropriately called the magnetic\nsusceptibility. It is a measure of how a magnetic material responds to an\n\nexternal field. Table 5.2 lists χ for some elements. It is small and positive\nfor materials, which are called paramagnetic. It is small and negative for\n\nmaterials, which are termed diamagnetic. In the latter case M and H are\n\nopposite in direction. From Eqs. (5.16) and (5.17) we obtain,\n\n0(1 )µ χ= +B H (5.18)\n\n= µ\n0 \n\nµ\nr \nH\n\n=  µ H (5.19)\n\nwhere µ\nr\n= 1 + χ, is a dimensionless quantity called the relative magnetic\n\npermeability of the substance. It is the analog of the dielectric constant in\n\nelectrostatics. The magnetic permeability of the substance is µ and it has\nthe same dimensions and units as µ\n\n0\n;\n\nµ = µ\n0\nµ\n\nr\n = µ\n\n0\n (1+χ).\n\nThe three quantities χ, µ\nr\n and µ are interrelated and only one of\n\nthem is independent. Given one, the other two may be easily determined.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nMagnetism and\n\nMatter\n\n191\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 5\n\n.1\n0\n\nExample 5.10 A solenoid has a core of a material with relative\npermeability 400. The windings of the solenoid are insulated from the\ncore and carry a current of 2A. If the number of turns is 1000 per\n\nmetre, calculate (a) H, (b) M, (c) B and (d) the magnetising current I\nm\n.\n\nSolution\n(a) The field H is dependent of the material of the core, and is\n\nH = nI = 1000 × 2.0 = 2 ×10\n3\n A/m.\n\n(b) The magnetic field B is given by\nB = µ\n\nr\n µ\n\n0\n H\n\n   = 400 × 4π ×10–7 (N/A2) × 2 × 103 (A/m)\n   = 1.0 T\n\n(c) Magnetisation is given by\n\nM = (B– µ\n0\n H )/ µ\n\n0\n\n    = (µ\nr\n µ\n\n0\n H–µ\n\n0\n H )/µ\n\n0\n = (µ\n\nr\n – 1)H = 399 × H\n\n     ≅ 8 × 105 A/m\n(d) The magnetising current I\n\nM\n is the additional current that needs\n\nto be passed through the windings of the solenoid in the absence\nof the core which would give a B value as in the presence of the\n\ncore. Thus B = µ\nr\n n (I + I\n\nM\n). Using I = 2A, B = 1 T, we get I\n\nM\n = 794 A.\n\n5.6  MAGNETIC PROPERTIES OF MATERIALS\nThe discussion in the previous section helps us to classify materials as\n\ndiamagnetic, paramagnetic or ferromagnetic. In terms of the susceptibility\n\nχ , a material is diamagnetic if χ  is negative, para- if χ  is positive and\nsmall, and ferro- if χ  is large and positive.\n\nA glance at Table 5.3 gives one a better feeling for these\n\nmaterials. Here ε is a small positive number introduced to quantify\nparamagnetic materials. Next, we describe these materials in some\n\ndetail.\n\nTABLE 5.2  MAGNETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY OF SOME ELEMENTS AT 300 K\n\nDiamagnetic substance χχχχχ Paramagnetic substance χχχχχ\n\nBismuth –1.66 × 10\n–5\n\nAluminium 2.3 × 10\n–5\n\nCopper –9.8 × 10–6 Calcium 1.9 × 10–5\n\nDiamond –2.2 × 10\n–5\n\nChromium 2.7 × 10\n–4\n\nGold –3.6 × 10\n–5\n\nLithium 2.1 × 10\n–5\n\nLead –1.7 × 10–5 Magnesium 1.2 × 10–5\n\nMercury –2.9 × 10\n–5\n\nNiobium 2.6 × 10\n–5\n\nNitrogen (STP) –5.0 × 10\n–9\n\nOxygen (STP) 2.1 × 10\n–6\n\nSilver –2.6 × 10–5 Platinum 2.9 × 10–4\n\nSilicon –4.2 × 10\n–6\n\nTungsten 6.8 × 10\n–5\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n192\n\n5.6.1  Diamagnetism\n\nDiamagnetic substances are those which have tendency to move from\nstronger to the weaker part of the external magnetic field. In other words,\nunlike the way a magnet attracts metals like iron, it would repel a\ndiamagnetic substance.\n\nFigure 5.12(a) shows a bar of diamagnetic material placed in an external\nmagnetic field. The field lines are repelled or expelled and the field inside\nthe material is reduced. In most cases, as is evident from\nTable 5.2, this reduction is slight, being one part in 10\n\n5\n. When placed in a\n\nnon-uniform magnetic field, the bar will tend to move from high to low field.\nThe simplest explanation for diamagnetism is as follows. Electrons in\n\nan atom orbiting around nucleus possess orbital angular momentum.\nThese orbiting electrons are equivalent to current-carrying loop and thus\npossess orbital magnetic moment. Diamagnetic substances are the ones\nin which resultant magnetic moment in an atom is zero. When magnetic\nfield is applied, those electrons having orbital magnetic moment in the\nsame direction slow down and those in the opposite direction speed up.\nThis happens due to induced current in accordance with Lenz’s law which\nyou will study in Chapter 6. Thus, the substance develops a net magnetic\nmoment in direction opposite to that of the applied field and hence\nrepulsion.\n\nSome diamagnetic materials are bismuth, copper, lead, silicon,\n\nnitrogen (at STP), water and sodium chloride. Diamagnetism is present\n\nin all the substances. However, the effect is so weak in most cases that it\ngets shifted by other effects like paramagnetism, ferromagnetism, etc.\n\nThe most exotic diamagnetic materials are superconductors. These\n\nare metals, cooled to very low temperatures which exhibits both perfect\n\nconductivity and perfect diamagnetism. Here the field lines are completely\nexpelled!  χ = –1 and µ\n\nr\n = 0. A superconductor repels a magnet and (by\n\nNewton’s third law) is repelled by the magnet. The phenomenon of perfect\n\ndiamagnetism in superconductors is called the Meissner effect, after the\n\nname of its discoverer. Superconducting magnets can be gainfully\nexploited in variety of situations, for example, for running magnetically\n\nlevitated superfast trains.\n\n5.6.2  Paramagnetism\n\nParamagnetic substances are those which get weakly magnetised when\nplaced in an external magnetic field. They have tendency to move from a\nregion of weak magnetic field to strong magnetic field, i.e., they get weakly\n\nattracted to a magnet.\n\nTABLE 5.3\n\nDiamagnetic Paramagnetic Ferromagnetic\n\n–1 ≤ χ < 0 0 < χ <  ε χ >> 1\n\n0 ≤ µ\nr\n < 1 1< µ\n\nr\n < 1+ ε µ\n\nr\n >> 1\n\nµ < µ\n0\n\nµ > µ\n0\n\nµ >> µ\n0\n\nFIGURE 5.12\nBehaviour of\n\nmagnetic field lines\nnear a\n\n(a) diamagnetic,\n\n(b) paramagnetic\nsubstance.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nMagnetism and\n\nMatter\n\n193\n\nThe individual atoms (or ions or molecules) of a paramagnetic material\npossess a permanent magnetic dipole moment of their own. On account\n\nof the ceaseless random thermal motion of the atoms, no net magnetisation\nis seen. In the presence of an external field B\n\n0\n, which is strong enough,\n\nand at low temperatures, the individual atomic dipole moment can be\n\nmade to align and point in the same direction as B\n0\n. Figure 5.12(b) shows\n\na bar of paramagnetic material placed in an external field. The field lines\ngets concentrated inside the material, and the field inside is enhanced. In\n\nmost cases, as is evident from Table 5.2, this enhancement is slight, being\none part in 10\n\n5\n. When placed in a non-uniform magnetic field, the bar\n\nwill tend to move from weak field to strong.\n\nSome paramagnetic materials are aluminium, sodium, calcium,\noxygen (at STP) and copper chloride. Experimentally, one finds that the\nmagnetisation of a paramagnetic material is inversely proportional to the\n\nabsolute temperature T ,\n\n0BM C\nT\n\n= [5.20(a)]\n\nor equivalently, using Eqs. (5.12) and (5.17)\n\n0C\nT\n\nµ\nχ = [5.20(b)]\n\nThis is known as Curie’s law, after its discoverer Pieree Curie (1859-\n1906). The constant C is called Curie’s constant. Thus, for a paramagnetic\n\nmaterial both χ and µ\nr\n depend not only on the material, but also\n\n(in a simple fashion) on the sample temperature. As the field is\nincreased or the temperature is lowered, the magnetisation increases until\n\nit reaches the saturation value M\ns\n, at which point all the dipoles are\n\nperfectly aligned with the field. Beyond this, Curie’s law [Eq. (5.20)] is no\nlonger valid.\n\n5.6.3  Ferromagnetism\n\nFerromagnetic substances are those which gets strongly magnetised when\nplaced in an external magnetic field. They have strong tendency to move\n\nfrom a region of weak magnetic field to strong magnetic field, i.e., they get\n\nstrongly attracted to a magnet.\nThe individual atoms (or ions or molecules) in a ferromagnetic material\n\npossess a dipole moment as in a paramagnetic material. However, they\ninteract with one another in such a way that they spontaneously align\nthemselves in a common direction over a macroscopic volume called\n\ndomain. The explanation of this cooperative effect requires quantum\nmechanics and is beyond the scope of this textbook. Each domain has a\nnet magnetisation. Typical domain size is 1mm and the domain contains\n\nabout 10\n11\n\n atoms. In the first instant, the magnetisation varies randomly\nfrom domain to domain and there is no bulk magnetisation. This is shown\nin Fig. 5.13(a). When we apply an external magnetic field B\n\n0\n, the domains\n\norient themselves in the direction of B\n0\n and simultaneously the domain\n\noriented in the direction of B\n0\n grow in size. This existence of domains and\n\ntheir motion in B\n0\n are not speculations. One may observe this under a\n\nmicroscope after sprinkling a liquid suspension of powdered\n\nFIGURE 5.13\n\n(a) Randomly\noriented domains,\n\n(b) Aligned domains.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n194  E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 5\n\n.1\n1\n\nferromagnetic substance of samples. This motion of suspension can be\nobserved. Figure 5.12(b) shows the situation when the domains have\n\naligned and amalgamated to form a single ‘giant’ domain.\n Thus, in a ferromagnetic material the field lines are highly\n\nconcentrated. In non-uniform magnetic field, the sample tends to move\n\ntowards the region of high field. We may wonder as to what happens\nwhen the external field is removed. In some ferromagnetic materials the\nmagnetisation persists. Such materials are called hard magnetic materials\n\nor hard ferromagnets. Alnico, an alloy of iron, aluminium, nickel, cobalt\nand copper, is one such material. The naturally occurring lodestone is\nanother. Such materials form permanent magnets to be used among other\n\nthings as a compass needle. On the other hand, there is a class of\nferromagnetic materials in which the magnetisation disappears on removal\nof the external field. Soft iron is one such material. Appropriately enough,\n\nsuch materials are called soft ferromagnetic materials. There are a number\nof elements, which are ferromagnetic: iron, cobalt, nickel, gadolinium,\netc. The relative magnetic permeability is >1000!\n\nThe ferromagnetic property depends on temperature. At high enough\ntemperature, a ferromagnet becomes a paramagnet. The domain structure\ndisintegrates with temperature. This disappearance of magnetisation with\n\ntemperature is gradual. It is a phase transition reminding us of the melting\nof a solid crystal. The temperature of transition from ferromagnetic to\nparamagnetism is called the Curie temperature T\n\nc\n. Table 5.4 lists\n\nthe Curie temperature of certain ferromagnets. The susceptibility\nabove the Curie temperature, i.e., in the paramagnetic phase is\ndescribed by,\n\n( )c\nc\n\nC\nT T\n\nT T\nχ = >\n\n− (5.21)\n\nTABLE 5.4 CURIE TEMPERATURE T\nC\n OF SOME\n\nFERROMAGNETIC MATERIALS\n\nMaterial       T\nc\n (K)\n\nCobalt       1394\n\nIron       1043\n\nFe\n2\nO\n\n3\n        893\n\nNickel         631\n\nGadolinium         317\n\nExample 5.11 A domain in ferromagnetic iron is in the form of a cube\nof side length 1µm.

Let the material be unmagnetised initially. We\nplace it in a solenoid and increase the current through the\nsolenoid. The magnetic field B in the material rises and\nsaturates as depicted in the curve Oa. This behaviour\nrepresents the alignment and merger of domains until no\nfurther enhancement is possible. It is pointless to increase\nthe current (and hence the magnetic intensity H ) beyond\nthis. Next, we decrease H and reduce it to zero. At H = 0, B\n≠ 0. This is represented by the curve ab. The value of B at\nH = 0 is called retentivity or remanence. In Fig. 5.14, B\n\nR\n ~\n\n1.2 T, where the subscript R denotes retentivity. The\ndomains are not completely randomised even though the\nexternal driving field has been removed. Next, the current\nin the solenoid is reversed and slowly increased. Certain\ndomains are flipped until the net field inside stands\nnullified. This is represented by the curve bc. The value of\nH at c is called coercivity. In Fig. 5.14 H\n\nc\n ~ –90 A m–1. As\n\nthe reversed current is increased in magnitude, we once\nagain obtain saturation. The curve cd depicts this. The\nsaturated magnetic field B\n\ns\n ~ 1.5 T. Next, the current is\n\nreduced (curve de) and reversed (curve ea). The cycle repeats\nitself. Note that the curve Oa does not retrace itself as H is reduced. For a\ngiven value of H, B is not unique but depends on previous history of the\nsample. This phenomenon is called hysterisis. The word hysterisis means\nlagging behind (and not ‘history’).\n\n5.7  PERMANENT MAGNETS AND ELECTROMAGNETS\nSubstances which at room temperature retain their ferromagnetic property\nfor a long period of time are called permanent magnets. Permanent\n\nFIGURE 5.14 The magnetic\nhysteresis loop is the B-H curve for\n\nferromagnetic materials.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n196\n\nmagnets can be made in a variety of ways. One can hold an\niron rod in the north-south direction and hammer it repeatedly.\n\nThe method is illustrated in Fig. 5.15. The illustration is from\na 400 year old book to emphasise that the making of\npermanent magnets is an old art. One can also hold a steel\n\nrod and stroke it with one end of a bar magnet a large number\nof times, always in the same sense to make a permanent\nmagnet.\n\nAn efficient way to make a permanent magnet is to place a\nferromagnetic rod in a solenoid and pass a current. The\nmagnetic field of the solenoid magnetises the rod.\n\nThe hysteresis curve (Fig. 5.14) allows us to select suitable\nmaterials for permanent magnets. The material should have\nhigh retentivity so that the magnet is strong and high coercivity\n\nso that the magnetisation is not erased by stray magnetic fields,\ntemperature fluctuations or minor mechanical damage.\nFurther, the material should have a high permeability. Steel is\n\none-favoured choice. It has a slightly smaller retentivity than\nsoft iron but this is outweighed by the much smaller coercivity\nof soft iron. Other suitable materials for permanent magnets\n\nare alnico, cobalt steel and ticonal.\nCore of electromagnets are made of ferromagnetic materials\n\nwhich have high permeability and low retentivity. Soft iron is a suitable\n\nmaterial for electromagnets. On placing a soft iron rod in a solenoid and\npassing a current, we increase the magnetism of the solenoid by a\nthousand fold. When we switch off the solenoid current, the magnetism is\n\neffectively switched off since the soft iron core has a low retentivity. The\narrangement is shown in Fig. 5.16.\n\nFIGURE 5.15 A blacksmith\n\nforging a permanent magnet by\nstriking a red-hot rod of iron\n\nkept in the north-south\n\ndirection with a hammer. The\nsketch is recreated from an\nillustration in De Magnete, a\n\nwork published in 1600 and\nauthored by William Gilbert,\nthe court physician to Queen\n\nElizabeth of England.\n\nFIGURE 5.16  A soft iron core in solenoid acts as an electromagnet.\n\nIn certain applications, the material goes through an ac cycle of\n\nmagnetisation for a long period. This is the case in transformer cores and\ntelephone diaphragms. The hysteresis curve of such materials must be\nnarrow. The energy dissipated and the heating will consequently be small.\n\nThe material must have a high resistivity to lower eddy current losses.\nYou will study about eddy currents in Chapter 6.\n\nElectromagnets are used in electric bells, loudspeakers and telephone\n\ndiaphragms. Giant electromagnets are used in cranes to lift machinery,\nand bulk quantities of iron and steel.\n\nIn\nd\n\nia\n’s\n\n \nM\n\na\ng\n\nn\ne\n\nti\nc\n \nF\n\nie\nld\n\n:\n\nh\ntt\np\n:/\n/w\n\nw\nw\n\n.i\nig\n\nm\n.r\ne\ns.\n\nin\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nMagnetism and\n\nMatter\n\n197\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. The science of magnetism is old. It has been known since ancient times\nthat magnetic materials tend to point in the north-south direction; like\n\nmagnetic poles repel and unlike ones attract; and cutting a bar magnet\n\nin two leads to two smaller magnets. Magnetic poles cannot be isolated.\n\n2. When a bar magnet of dipole moment m is placed in a uniform magnetic\nfield B,\n\n     (a) the force on it is zero,\n     (b) the torque on it is m × B,\n     (c) its potential energy is –m.B, where we choose the zero of energy at\n\nthe orientation when m is perpendicular to B.\n\n3. Consider a bar magnet of size l and magnetic moment m, at a distance\nr from its mid-point, where r >>l, the magnetic field B due to this bar\nis,\n\n0\n\n3\n2 r\n\nµ\n=\n\nπ\n\nm\nB     (along axis)\n\n   = 0\n3\n\n–\n4 r\n\nµ\nπ\n\nm\n    (along equator)\n\n4. Gauss’s law for magnetism states that the net magnetic flux through\nany closed surface is zero\n\n0φ\n\n∆\n\n= ∆ =∑\nS\n\nB SiB\nall area\nelements\n\n5. The earth’s magnetic field resembles that of a (hypothetical) magnetic\n\ndipole located at the centre of the earth. The pole near the geographic\n\nnorth pole of the earth is called the north magnetic pole. Similarly, the\n\npole near the geographic south pole is called the south magnetic pole.\n\nThis dipole is aligned making a small angle with the rotation axis of\nthe earth. The magnitude of the field on the earth’s surface  ≈  4 × 10–5 T.\n\nMAPPING INDIA’S MAGNETIC FIELD\n\nBecause of its practical application in prospecting, communication, and navigation, the\nmagnetic field of the earth is mapped by most nations with an accuracy comparable to\ngeographical mapping. In India over a dozen observatories exist, extending from\n\nTrivandrum (now Thrivuvananthapuram) in the south to Gulmarg in the north. These\nobservatories work under the aegis of the Indian Institute of Geomagnetism (IIG), in Colaba,\nMumbai. The IIG grew out of the Colaba and Alibag observatories and was formally\n\nestablished in 1971. The IIG monitors (via its nation-wide observatories), the geomagnetic\nfields and fluctuations on land, and under the ocean and in space. Its services are used\nby the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. (ONGC), the National Institute of\n\nOceanography (NIO) and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). It is a part of\nthe world-wide network which ceaselessly updates the geomagnetic data. Now India has\na permanent station called Gangotri.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n198\n\n6. Three quantities are needed to specify the magnetic field of the earth\n\non its surface – the horizontal component, the magnetic declination,\n\nand the magnetic dip. These are known as the elements of the earth’s\n\nmagnetic field.\n\n7. Consider a material placed in an external magnetic field B\n0\n. The\n\nmagnetic intensity is defined as,\n\n0\n\n0µ\n=\n\nB\nH\n\nThe magnetisation M of the material is its dipole moment per unit volume.\nThe magnetic field B in the material is,\n\n      B = µ\n0\n (H + M)\n\n8. For a linear material M = χ H. So that B = µ H and χ is called the\nmagnetic susceptibility of the material. The three quantities, χ, the\nrelative magnetic permeability µ\n\nr\n, and the magnetic permeability µ  are\n\nrelated as follows:\n\nµ = µ\n0\n µ\n\nr\n\n      µ\nr\n = 1+ χ\n\n9. Magnetic materials are broadly classified as: diamagnetic, paramagnetic,\n\nand ferromagnetic. For diamagnetic materials χ is negative and small\nand for paramagnetic materials it is positive and small. Ferromagnetic\n\nmaterials have large χ and are characterised by non-linear relation\nbetween B and H. They show the property of hysteresis.\n\n10. Substances, which at room temperature, retain their ferromagnetic\n\nproperty for a long period of time are called permanent magnets.\n\nPhysical quantity Symbol Nature Dimensions Units Remarks\n\nPermeability of µ\n0\n\nScalar [MLT\n–2\n\n A\n–2\n\n] T m A\n–1 µ\n\n0\n/4π = 10–7\n\nfree space\n\nMagnetic field, B Vector [MT\n–2\n\n A\n–1\n\n] T (tesla) 10\n4\n G (gauss) = 1 T\n\nMagnetic induction,\nMagnetic flux density\n\nMagnetic moment m Vector [L\n–2\n\n A] A m\n2\n\nMagnetic flux φ\nB\n\nScalar [ML\n2\nT\n\n–2\n A\n\n–1\n] W (weber) W = T m\n\n2\n\nMagnetisation M Vector [L\n–1\n\n A] A m\n–1\n\nMagnetic moment\n\nVolume\n\nMagnetic intensity H Vector [L\n–1\n\n A] A m\n–1\n\nB = µ\n0\n (H + M)\n\nMagnetic field\nstrength\n\nMagnetic χ Scalar - - M = χH\nsusceptibility\n\nRelative magnetic µ\nr\n\nScalar - - B = µ\n0 \n\nµ\nr\n H\n\npermeability\n\nMagnetic permeability µ Scalar [MLT–2 A–2] T m A–1 µ = µ\n0 \n\nµ\nr\n\nN A–2 B = µ H\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nMagnetism and\n\nMatter\n\n199\n\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n\n1. A satisfactory understanding of magnetic phenomenon in terms of moving\ncharges/currents was arrived at after 1800 AD. But technological\n\nexploitation of the directional properties of magnets predates this scientific\n\nunderstanding by two thousand years. Thus, scientific understanding is\n\nnot a necessary condition for engineering applications. Ideally, science\n\nand engineering go hand-in-hand, one leading and assisting the other in\n\ntandem.\n\n2. Magnetic monopoles do not exist. If you slice a magnet in half, you get\n\ntwo smaller magnets. On the other hand, isolated positive and negative\n\ncharges exist. There exists a smallest unit of charge, for example, the\nelectronic charge with value |e| = 1.6 ×10–19 C. All other charges are\n\nintegral multiples of this smallest unit charge. In other words, charge is\n\nquantised. We do not know why magnetic monopoles do not exist or why\n\nelectric charge is quantised.\n\n3. A consequence of the fact that magnetic monopoles do not exist is that\n\nthe magnetic field lines are continuous and form closed loops. In contrast,\n\nthe electrostatic lines of force begin on a positive charge and terminate\n\non the negative charge (or fade out at infinity).\n\n4. The earth’s magnetic field is not due to a huge bar magnet inside it. The\n\nearth’s core is hot and molten. Perhaps convective currents in this core\n\nare responsible for the earth’s magnetic field. As to what ‘dynamo’ effect\n\nsustains this current, and why the earth’s field reverses polarity every\nmillion years or so, we do not know.\n\n5. A miniscule difference in the value of χ, the magnetic susceptibility, yields\nradically different behaviour: diamagnetic versus paramagnetic. For\ndiamagnetic materials χ = –10–5 whereas χ = +10–5 for paramagnetic\nmaterials.\n\n6. There exists a perfect diamagnet, namely, a superconductor. This is a\nmetal at very low temperatures. In this case χ = –1, µ\n\nr\n = 0, µ = 0. The\n\nexternal magnetic field is totally expelled. Interestingly, this material is\n\nalso a perfect conductor. However, there exists no classical theory which\n\nties these two properties together. A quantum-mechanical theory by\n\nBardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer (BCS theory) explains these effects. The\n\nBCS theory was proposed in1957 and was eventually recognised by a Nobel\nPrize in physics in 1970.\n\n7. The phenomenon of magnetic hysteresis is reminiscent of similar\n\nbehaviour concerning the elastic properties of materials. Strain\nmay not be proportional to stress; here H and B (or M) are not\n\nlinearly related. The stress-strain curve exhibits hysteresis and\n\narea enclosed by it represents the energy dissipated per unit volume.\n\nA similar interpretation can be given to the B-H magnetic hysteresis\n\ncurve.\n\n8. Diamagnetism is universal. It is present in all materials. But it\n\nis weak and hard to detect if the substance is para- or ferromagnetic.\n\n9. We have classified materials as diamagnetic, paramagnetic, and\n\nferromagnetic. However, there exist additional types of magnetic material\n\nsuch as ferrimagnetic, anti-ferromagnetic, spin glass, etc. with properties\n\nwhich are exotic and mysterious.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n200\n\nEXERCISES\n\n5.1 Answer the following questions regarding earth’s magnetism:\n\n(a) A vector needs three quantities for its specification.
