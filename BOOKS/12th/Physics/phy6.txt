In the early decades of the nineteenth century,\nexperiments on electric current by Oersted, Ampere and a few others\n\nestablished the fact that electricity and magnetism are inter-related. They\nfound that moving electric charges produce magnetic fields. For example,\nan electric current deflects a magnetic compass needle placed in its vicinity.\n\nThis naturally raises the questions like: Is the converse effect possible?\nCan moving magnets produce electric currents? Does the nature permit\nsuch a relation between electricity and magnetism? The answer is\n\nresounding yes! The experiments of Michael Faraday in England and\nJoseph Henry in USA, conducted around 1830, demonstrated\nconclusively that electric currents were induced in closed coils when\n\nsubjected to changing magnetic fields. In this chapter, we will study the\nphenomena associated with changing magnetic fields and understand\nthe underlying principles. The phenomenon in which electric current is\n\ngenerated by varying magnetic fields is appropriately called\nelectromagnetic induction.\n\nWhen Faraday first made public his discovery that relative motion\n\nbetween a bar magnet and a wire loop produced a small current in the\nlatter, he was asked, “What is the use of it?” His reply was: “What is the\nuse of a new born baby?” The phenomenon of electromagnetic induction\n\nChapter Six\n\nELECTROMAGNETIC\n\nINDUCTION\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectromagnetic\n\nInduction\n\n205\n\nis not merely of theoretical or academic interest but also\nof practical utility. Imagine a world where there is no\nelectricity – no electric lights, no trains, no telephones and\nno personal computers. The pioneering experiments of\nFaraday and Henry have led directly to the development\nof modern day generators and transformers. Today’s\ncivilisation owes its progress to a great extent to the\ndiscovery of electromagnetic induction.\n\n6.2 THE EXPERIMENTS OF FARADAY AND\n\nHENRY\nThe discovery and understanding of electromagnetic\ninduction are based on a long series of experiments carried\nout by Faraday and Henry. We shall now describe some\nof these experiments.\n\nExperiment 6.1\n\nFigure 6.1 shows a coil C\n1\n* connected to a galvanometer\n\nG. When the North-pole of a bar magnet is pushed\ntowards the coil, the pointer in the galvanometer deflects,\nindicating  the presence of electric  current in the coil. The\ndeflection lasts as long as the bar magnet is in motion.\nThe galvanometer does not show any deflection when the\nmagnet is held stationary. When the magnet is pulled\naway from the coil, the galvanometer shows deflection in\nthe opposite direction, which indicates reversal of the\ncurrent’s direction. Moreover, when the South-pole of\nthe bar magnet is moved towards or away from the\ncoil, the deflections in the galvanometer are opposite\nto that observed with the North-pole for similar\nmovements. Further, the deflection (and hence current)\nis found to be larger when the magnet is pushed\ntowards or pulled away from the coil faster. Instead,\nwhen the bar magnet is held fixed and the coil C\n\n1\n is\n\nmoved towards or away from the magnet, the same\neffects are observed. It shows that it is the relative\nmotion between the magnet and the coil that is\n\nresponsible for generation (induction) of electric\n\ncurrent in the coil.\n\nExperiment 6.2\n\nIn Fig. 6.2 the bar magnet is replaced by a second coil\nC\n\n2\n connected to a battery. The steady current in the\n\ncoil C\n2\n produces a steady magnetic field. As coil C\n\n2\n is\n\n* Wherever the term ‘coil’ or ‘loop’ is used, it is assumed that they are made up of\n\nconducting material and are prepared using wires which are coated with insulating\n\nmaterial.\n\nFIGURE 6.1 When the bar magnet is\npushed towards the coil, the pointer in\n\nthe galvanometer G deflects.\n\nJosheph Henry [1797 –\n1878] American experimental\nphysicist, professor at\nPrinceton University and first\ndirector of the Smithsonian\nInstitution. He made important\nimprovements in electro-\nmagnets by winding coils of\ninsulated wire around iron\npole pieces and  invented an\nelectromagnetic motor and a\nnew, efficient telegraph. He\ndiscoverd self-induction and\ninvestigated how currents in\none circuit induce currents in\nanother.\n\nJ\nO\n\nS\nE\n\nP\nH\n\n H\nE\n\nN\nR\n\nY\n (1\n\n7\n9\n7\n –\n\n 1\n8\n7\n8\n)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n206\n\nmoved towards the coil C\n1\n, the galvanometer shows a\n\ndeflection. This indicates that electric current is induced in\ncoil C\n\n1\n. When C\n\n2\n is moved away, the galvanometer shows a\n\ndeflection again, but this time in the opposite direction. The\ndeflection lasts as long as coil C\n\n2\n is in motion. When the coil\n\nC\n2 \nis held fixed and C\n\n1\n is moved, the same effects are observed.\n\nAgain, it is the relative motion between the coils that induces\nthe electric current.\n\nExperiment 6.3\n\nThe above two experiments involved relative motion between\na magnet and a coil and between two coils, respectively.\nThrough another experiment, Faraday showed that this\nrelative motion is not an absolute requirement. Figure 6.3\nshows two coils C\n\n1\n and C\n\n2\n held stationary. Coil C\n\n1\n is connected\n\nto galvanometer G while the second coil C\n2\n is connected to a\n\nbattery through a tapping key K.\n\nFIGURE 6.2  Current is\ninduced in coil C\n\n1\n due to motion\n\nof the current carrying coil C\n2\n.\n\nFIGURE 6.3 Experimental set-up for Experiment 6.3.\n\nIt is observed that the galvanometer shows a momentary deflection\nwhen the tapping key K is pressed. The pointer in the galvanometer returns\nto zero immediately. If the key is held pressed continuously, there is no\ndeflection in the galvanometer. When the key is released, a momentory\ndeflection is observed again, but in the opposite direction. It is also observed\nthat the deflection increases dramatically when an iron rod is inserted\ninto the coils along their axis.\n\n6.3  MAGNETIC FLUX\nFaraday’s great insight lay in discovering a simple mathematical relation\nto explain the series of experiments he carried out on electromagnetic\ninduction. However, before we state and appreciate his laws, we must get\nfamiliar with the notion of magnetic flux, Φ \n\nB\n. Magnetic flux is defined in\n\nthe same way as electric flux is defined in Chapter 1. Magnetic flux through\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectromagnetic\n\nInduction\n\n207\n\na plane of area A placed in a uniform magnetic field B (Fig. 6.4) can\nbe written as\n\nΦ \nB\n  = B . A = BA cos θ (6.1)\n\nwhere θ   is angle between B and A. The notion of the area as a vector\nhas been discussed earlier in Chapter 1. Equation (6.1) can be\nextended to curved surfaces and nonuniform fields.\n\nIf the magnetic field has different magnitudes and directions at\nvarious parts of a surface as shown in Fig. 6.5, then the magnetic\nflux through the surface is given by\n\n1 1 2 2\nd dΦ = + +B A B A. .\n\nB\n... = B A.i id\n\nall\n\n∑ (6.2)\n\nwhere ‘all’ stands for summation over all the area elements dA\ni\n\ncomprising the surface and B\ni\n is the magnetic field at the area element\n\ndA\ni\n. The SI unit of magnetic flux is weber (Wb) or tesla meter\n\nsquared (T m\n2\n). Magnetic flux is a scalar quantity.\n\n6.4  FARADAY’S LAW OF INDUCTION\nFrom the experimental observations, Faraday arrived at a\n\nconclusion that an emf is induced in a coil when magnetic flux\n\nthrough the coil changes with time. Experimental observations\n\ndiscussed in Section 6.2 can be explained using this concept.\n\nThe motion of a magnet towards or away from coil C\n1\n in\n\nExperiment 6.1 and moving a current-carrying coil C\n2\n towards\n\nor away from coil C\n1\n in Experiment 6.2, change the magnetic\n\nflux associated with coil C\n1\n.  The change in magnetic flux induces\n\nemf in coil C\n1\n. It was this induced emf which caused electric\n\ncurrent to flow in coil C\n1 \n\nand through the galvanometer. A\n\nplausible explanation for the observations of Experiment 6.3 is\n\nas follows: When the tapping key K is pressed, the current in\n\ncoil C\n2\n (and the resulting magnetic field) rises from zero to a\n\nmaximum value in a short time. Consequently, the magnetic\n\nflux through the neighbouring coil C\n1\n also increases. It is the change in\n\nmagnetic flux through coil C\n1\n that produces an induced emf in coil C\n\n1\n.\n\nWhen the key is held pressed, current in coil C\n2\n is constant. Therefore,\n\nthere is no change in the magnetic flux through coil C\n1\n and the current in\n\ncoil C\n1\n drops to zero. When the key is released, the current in C\n\n2\n and the\n\nresulting magnetic field decreases from the maximum value to zero in a\n\nshort time. This results in a decrease in magnetic flux through coil C\n1\n\nand hence again induces an electric current in coil C\n1\n*. The common\n\npoint in all these observations is that the time rate of change of magnetic\n\nflux through a circuit induces emf in it. Faraday stated experimental\n\nobservations in the form of a law called Faraday’s law of electromagnetic\n\ninduction. The law is stated below.\n\nFIGURE 6.4 A plane of\nsurface area A placed in a\nuniform magnetic field B.\n\nFIGURE 6.5 Magnetic field B\ni\n\nat the i th area element. dA\ni\n\nrepresents area vector of the\ni th area element.\n\n* Note that sensitive electrical instruments in the vicinity of an electromagnet\ncan be damaged due to the induced emfs (and the resulting currents)  when the\n\nelectromagnet is turned on or off.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n208\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 6\n\n.1\n\nThe magnitude of the induced emf in a circuit is equal\nto the time rate of change of magnetic flux through the\n\ncircuit.\n\nMathematically, the induced emf is given by\n\nd\n–\n\nd\nB\n\nt\n\nΦ\nε = (6.3)\n\nThe negative sign indicates the direction of ε  and hence\nthe direction of current in a closed loop. This will be\ndiscussed in detail in the next section.\n\nIn the case of a closely wound coil of N turns, change\n\nof flux associated with each turn, is the same. Therefore,\nthe expression for the total induced emf is given by\n\nd\n–\n\nd\nBN\nt\n\nΦ\nε = (6.4)\n\nThe induced emf can be increased by increasing the\n\nnumber of turns N of a closed coil.\n\nFrom Eqs. (6.1) and (6.2), we see that the flux can be\nvaried by changing any one or more of the terms B, A and\nθ. In Experiments 6.1 and 6.2 in Section 6.2, the flux is\nchanged by varying B. The flux can also be altered by\nchanging the shape of a coil (that is, by shrinking it or\nstretching it) in a magnetic field, or rotating a coil in a\n\nmagnetic field such that the angle θ  between B and A\nchanges. In these cases too, an emf is induced in the\nrespective coils.\n\nExample 6.1  Consider Experiment 6.2. (a) What would you do to obtain\na large deflection of the galvanometer? (b) How would you demonstrate\nthe presence of an induced current in the absence of a galvanometer?\n\nSolution\n\n(a) To obtain a large deflection, one or more of the following steps can\nbe taken:  (i) Use a rod made of soft iron inside the coil C\n\n2\n, (ii) Connect\n\nthe coil to a powerful battery, and (iii) Move the arrangement rapidly\ntowards the test coil C\n\n1\n.\n\n(b) Replace the galvanometer by a small bulb, the kind one finds in a\n\nsmall torch light. The relative motion between the two coils will cause\nthe bulb to glow and thus demonstrate the presence of an induced\ncurrent.\n\nIn experimental physics one must learn to innovate. Michael Faraday\n\nwho is ranked as one of the best experimentalists ever, was legendary\n\nfor his innovative skills.\n\nExample 6.2 A square loop of side 10 cm and resistance 0.5 Ω is\nplaced vertically in the east-west  plane. A uniform magnetic field of\n0.10 T is set up across the plane in the north-east direction. The\nmagnetic field is decreased to zero in 0.70 s at a steady rate. Determine\n\nthe magnitudes of induced emf and current during this time-interval.\n\nMichael Faraday  [1791–\n1867] Faraday made\nnumerous contributions to\nscience, viz., the discovery\nof electromagnetic\ninduction, the laws of\nelectrolysis, benzene, and\nthe fact that the plane of\npolarisation is rotated in an\nelectric field. He is also\ncredited with the invention\nof the electric motor, the\nelectric generator and the\ntransformer. He is widely\nregarded as the greatest\nexperimental scientist of\nthe nineteenth century.\n\nM\nIC\n\nH\nA\n\nE\nL\n F\n\nA\nR\n\nA\nD\n\nA\nY\n (\n\n1\n7\n9\n1\n–\n1\n8\n6\n7\n)\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 6\n\n.2\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectromagnetic\n\nInduction\n\n209\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 6\n\n.2\n\nSolution The angle θ made by the area vector of the coil with the\nmagnetic field is 45\n\n°\n.

But it is a steady field (which does not change within the time\n\nspan of the experiment) and hence does not induce any emf.\n\nExample 6.3\n\nA circular coil of radius 10 cm, 500 turns and resistance 2 Ω is placed\nwith its plane perpendicular to the horizontal component of the earth’s\n\nmagnetic field. It is rotated about its vertical diameter through 180°\nin 0.25 s. Estimate the magnitudes of the emf and current induced in\nthe coil.

The statement of the law is:\n\nThe polarity of induced emf is such that it tends to produce a current\n\nwhich opposes the change in magnetic flux that produced it.\n\nThe negative sign shown in Eq. (6.3) represents this effect. We can\n\nunderstand Lenz’s law by examining Experiment 6.1 in Section 6.2.1. In\n\nFig. 6.1, we see that the North-pole of a bar magnet is being pushed\n\ntowards the closed coil. As the North-pole of the bar magnet moves towards\n\nthe coil, the magnetic flux through the coil increases. Hence current is\n\ninduced in the coil in such a direction that it opposes the increase in flux.\n\nThis is possible only if the current in the coil is in a counter-clockwise\n\ndirection with respect to an observer situated on the side of the magnet.\n\nNote that magnetic moment associated with this current has North polarity\n\ntowards the North-pole of the approaching magnet. Similarly, if the North-\n\npole of the magnet is being withdrawn from the coil, the magnetic flux\n\nthrough the coil will decrease. To counter this decrease in magnetic flux,\n\nthe induced current in the coil flows in clockwise direction and its South-\n\npole faces the receding North-pole of the bar magnet. This would result in\n\nan attractive force which opposes the motion of the magnet and the\n\ncorresponding decrease in flux.\n\nWhat will happen if an open circuit is used in place of the closed loop\n\nin the above example? In this case too, an emf is induced across the open\n\nends of the circuit. The direction of the induced emf can be found\n\nusing Lenz’s law. Consider Figs. 6.6 (a) and (b). They provide an easier\n\nway to understand the direction of induced currents. Note that the\n\ndirection shown by  and  indicate the directions of the induced\n\ncurrents.\n\nA little reflection on this matter should convince us on the\n\ncorrectness of Lenz’s law. Suppose that the induced current was in\n\nthe direction opposite to the one depicted in Fig. 6.6(a). In that case,\n\nthe South-pole due to the induced current will face the approaching\n\nNorth-pole of the magnet. The bar magnet will then be attracted\n\ntowards the coil at an ever increasing acceleration. A gentle push on\n\nthe magnet will initiate the process and its velocity and kinetic energy\n\nwill continuously increase without expending any energy. If this can\n\nhappen, one could construct a perpetual-motion machine by a\n\nsuitable arrangement. This violates the law of conservation of energy\n\nand hence can not happen.\n\nNow consider the correct case shown in Fig. 6.6(a). In this situation,\n\nthe bar magnet experiences a repulsive force due to the induced\n\ncurrent. Therefore, a person has to do work in moving the magnet.\n\nWhere does the energy spent by the person go? This energy is\n\ndissipated by Joule heating produced by the induced current.\n\nFIGURE 6.6\n\nIllustration of\n\nLenz’s law.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectromagnetic\n\nInduction\n\n211\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 6\n\n.4\n\nExample 6.4\n\nFigure 6.7 shows planar loops of different shapes moving out of or\n\ninto a region of a magnetic field which is directed normal to the plane\nof the loop away from the reader. Determine the direction of induced\ncurrent in each loop using Lenz’s law.\n\nFIGURE 6.7\n\nSolution\n\n(i) The magnetic flux through the rectangular loop abcd increases,\ndue to the motion of the loop into the region of magnetic field, The\n\ninduced current must flow along the path bcdab so that it opposes\nthe increasing flux.\n\n(ii) Due to the outward motion, magnetic flux through the triangular\n\nloop abc decreases due to which the induced current flows along\nbacb, so as to oppose the change in flux.\n\n(iii) As the magnetic flux decreases due to motion of the irregular\n\nshaped loop abcd out of the region of magnetic field, the induced\ncurrent flows along cdabc, so as to oppose change in flux.\nNote that there are no induced current as long as the loops are\n\ncompletely inside or outside the region of the magnetic field.\n\nExample 6.5\n(a) A closed loop is held stationary in the magnetic field between the\n\nnorth and south poles of two permanent magnets held fixed. Can\nwe hope to generate current in the loop by using very strong\nmagnets?\n\n(b) A closed loop moves normal to the constant electric field between\nthe plates of a large capacitor. Is a current induced in the loop\n(i) when it is wholly inside the region between the capacitor plates\n(ii) when it is partially outside the plates of the capacitor? The\nelectric field is normal to the plane of the loop.\n\n(c) A rectangular loop and a circular loop are moving out of a uniform\nmagnetic field region (Fig. 6.8) to a field-free region with a constant\nvelocity v. In which loop do you expect the induced emf to be\nconstant during the passage out of the field region?  The field is\nnormal to the loops.\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 6\n\n.5\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n212\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 6\n\n.5\nFIGURE 6.8\n\n(d) Predict the polarity of the capacitor in the situation described by\n\nFig. 6.9.\n\nFIGURE 6.9\n\nSolution\n\n(a) No. However strong the magnet may be, current can be induced\n\nonly by changing the magnetic flux through the loop.\n(b) No current is induced in either case.

In the case of circular loop, the rate of change of\narea of the loop during its passage out of the field region is not\n\nconstant, hence induced emf will vary accordingly.\n(d) The polarity of plate ‘A’ will be positive with respect to plate ‘B’ in\n\nthe capacitor.\n\n6.6  MOTIONAL ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE\nLet us consider a straight conductor moving in a uniform and time-\nindependent magnetic field.  Figure 6.10 shows a rectangular conductor\nPQRS in which the conductor PQ is free to move. The rod PQ is moved\n\ntowards the left with a constant velocity v as\nshown in the figure. Assume that there is no\nloss of energy due to friction. PQRS forms a\n\nclosed circuit enclosing an area that changes\nas PQ moves. It is placed in a uniform magnetic\nfield B which is perpendicular to the plane of\n\nthis system. If the length RQ = x and RS = l, the\nmagnetic flux Φ\n\nB \nenclosed  by the loop PQRS\n\nwill be\n\nΦ\nB\n = Blx\n\nSince x is changing with time, the rate of change\nof flux Φ\n\nB \nwill induce an emf given by:\n\n( )– d d–\nd d\n\nB Blx\nt t\n\nΦ\nε = =\n\n   = \nd\n\n–\nd\n\nx\nBl Blv\n\nt\n= (6.5)\n\nFIGURE 6.10  The arm PQ is moved to the left\n\nside, thus decreasing the area of the\nrectangular loop.

Thus, we are able to produce\n\ninduced emf by moving a conductor instead of varying the magnetic field,\nthat is, by changing the magnetic flux enclosed by the circuit.\n\nIt is also possible to explain the motional emf expression in Eq. (6.5)\n\nby invoking the Lorentz force acting on the free charge carriers of conductor\nPQ. Consider any arbitrary charge q in the conductor PQ. When the rod\nmoves with speed v, the charge will also be moving with speed v in the\n\nmagnetic field B. The Lorentz force on this charge is qvB in magnitude,\nand its direction is towards Q. All charges experience the same force, in\nmagnitude and direction, irrespective of their position in the rod PQ.\n\nThe work done in moving the charge from P to Q is,\n\nW = qvBl\n\nSince emf is the work done per unit charge,\n\nW\n\nq\nε =\n\n    = Blv\n\nThis equation gives emf induced across the rod PQ and is identical\nto Eq. (6.5). We stress that our presentation is not wholly rigorous. But\nit does help us to understand the basis of Faraday’s law when\n\nthe conductor is moving in a uniform and time-independent\nmagnetic field.\n\nOn the other hand, it is not obvious how an emf is induced when a\n\nconductor is stationary and the magnetic field is changing – a fact which\nFaraday verified by numerous experiments. In the case of a stationary\nconductor, the force on its charges is given by\n\nF = q (E + v ××××× B) = qE (6.6)\n\nsince v = 0. Thus, any force on the charge must arise from the electric\nfield term E alone. Therefore, to explain the existence of induced emf or\ninduced current, we must assume that a time-varying magnetic field\ngenerates an electric field. However, we hasten to add that electric fields\nproduced by static electric charges have properties different from those\n\nproduced by time-varying magnetic fields. In Chapter 4, we learnt that\ncharges in motion (current) can exert force/torque on a stationary magnet.\nConversely, a bar magnet in motion (or more generally, a changing\n\nmagnetic field) can exert a force on the stationary charge. This is the\nfundamental significance of the Faraday’s discovery. Electricity and\nmagnetism are related.\n\nExample 6.6  A metallic rod of 1 m length is rotated with a frequency\n\nof 50 rev/s, with one end hinged at the centre and the other end at the\ncircumference of a circular metallic ring of radius 1 m, about an axis\npassing through the centre and perpendicular to the plane of the ring\n\n(Fig. 6.11).

Thus, the\nresulting separation of charges produces an emf across the ends of\n\nthe rod. At a certain value of emf, there is no more flow of electrons\nand a steady state is reached. Using Eq. (6.5), the magnitude of the\nemf generated across a length dr of the rod as it moves at right angles\n\nto the magnetic field is given by\n\nd dBv rε = .

The potential difference across the resistor is then equal to the\n\ninduced emf and equals B × (rate of change of area of loop).

Now we shall explore this aspect further\n\nwith a concrete example.\nLet r be the resistance of movable arm PQ of the rectangular conductor\n\nshown in Fig. 6.10. We assume that the remaining arms QR, RS and SP\n\nhave negligible resistances compared to r. Thus, the overall resistance of\nthe rectangular loop is r and this does not change as PQ is moved. The\ncurrent I in the loop is,\n\nI\nr\n\nε\n=\n\n   = \nB l v\n\nr\n(6.7)\n\nOn account of the presence of the magnetic field, there will be a force\non the arm PQ. This force  I (l ××××× B), is directed outwards in the direction\nopposite to the velocity of the rod. The magnitude of this force is,\n\nF = I l B = \n2 2\n\nB l v\n\nr\nwhere we have used Eq. (6.7). Note that this force arises due to drift velocity\nof charges (responsible for current) along the rod and the consequent\nLorentz force acting on them.\n\nAlternatively, the arm PQ is being pushed with a constant speed v,\nthe power required to do this is,\n\nP F v=\n\n    =\n2 2 2\n\nB l v\n\nr\n(6.8)\n\nThe agent that does this work is mechanical.

The arm PQ of the rectangular\n\nconductor is moved from x = 0, outwards. The uniform magnetic field is\nperpendicular to the plane and extends from x = 0 to x = b and is zero\nfor x > b. Only the arm PQ possesses substantial resistance r. Consider\n\nthe situation when the arm PQ  is pulled outwards from x = 0 to x = 2b,\nand is then moved back to x = 0 with constant speed v. Obtain expressions\nfor the flux, the induced emf, the force necessary to pull the arm and the\n\npower dissipated as Joule heat.

Even when bulk pieces of conductors\n\nare subjected to changing magnetic flux, induced currents\nare produced in them. However, their flow patterns resemble\nswirling eddies in water. This effect was discovered by physicist\n\nFoucault (1819-1868) and these currents are called eddy\ncurrents.\n\nConsider the apparatus shown in Fig. 6.13. A copper plate\n\nis allowed to swing like a simple pendulum between the pole\npieces of a strong magnet. It is found that the motion is damped\nand in a little while the plate comes to a halt in the magnetic\n\nfield. We can explain this phenomenon on the basis of\nelectromagnetic induction. Magnetic flux associated with the\nplate keeps on changing as the plate moves in and out of the\n\nregion between magnetic poles. The flux change induces eddy\ncurrents in the plate.  Directions of eddy currents are opposite\nwhen the plate swings into the region between the poles and\n\nwhen it swings out of the region.\nIf rectangular slots are made in the copper plate as shown\n\nin Fig. 6.14, area available to the flow of eddy currents is less.\n\nThus, the pendulum plate with holes or slots reduces\nelectromagnetic damping and the plate swings more freely.\nNote that magnetic moments of the induced currents (which\n\noppose the motion) depend upon the area enclosed by the\ncurrents (recall equation m = IA in Chapter 4).\nThis fact is helpful in reducing eddy currents in the metallic\n\ncores of transformers, electric motors and other such devices in\nwhich a coil is  to be wound over metallic core. Eddy currents are\nundesirable since they heat up the core and dissipate electrical\n\nenergy in the form of heat. Eddy currents are minimised by using\nlaminations of metal to make a metal core. The laminations are\nseparated by an insulating material like lacquer. The plane of the\n\nlaminations must be arranged parallel to the magnetic field, so\nthat they cut across the eddy current paths. This arrangement\nreduces the strength of the eddy currents. Since the dissipation\n\nof electrical energy into heat depends on the square of the strength\nof electric current, heat loss is substantially reduced.\n\nEddy currents are used to advantage in certain applications like:\n\n(i) Magnetic braking in trains: Strong electromagnets are situated\nabove the rails in some electrically powered trains. When the\nelectromagnets are activated, the eddy currents induced in the\nrails oppose the motion of the train. As there are no mechanical\nlinkages, the braking effect is smooth.\n\n(ii) Electromagnetic damping: Certain galvanometers have a fixed\ncore made of nonmagnetic metallic material. When the coil\noscillates, the eddy currents generated in the core oppose the\nmotion and bring the coil to rest quickly.\n\nFIGURE 6.13 Eddy currents are\ngenerated in the copper plate,\n\nwhile entering\n\nand leaving the region of\nmagnetic field.\n\nFIGURE 6.14 Cutting slots\nin the copper plate reduces\n\nthe effect of eddy currents.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectromagnetic\n\nInduction\n\n219\n\n(iii) Induction furnace: Induction furnace can be used to produce high\ntemperatures and can be utilised to prepare alloys, by melting the\n\nconstituent metals. A high frequency alternating current is passed\nthrough a coil which surrounds the metals to be melted. The eddy\ncurrents generated in the metals produce high temperatures sufficient\n\nto melt it.\n(iv) Electric power meters: The shiny metal disc in the electric power meter\n\n(analogue type) rotates due to the eddy currents. Electric currents\n\nare induced in the disc by magnetic fields produced by sinusoidally\nvarying currents in a coil.\nYou can observe the rotating shiny disc in the power meter of your\n\nhouse.\n\nELECTROMAGNETIC DAMPING\n\nTake two hollow thin cylindrical pipes of equal internal diameters made of aluminium and\n\nPVC, respectively. Fix them vertically with clamps on retort stands. Take a small cylinderical\n\nmagnet having diameter slightly smaller than the inner diameter of the pipes and drop it\n\nthrough each pipe in such a way that the magnet does not touch the sides of the pipes\n\nduring its fall. You will observe that the magnet dropped through the PVC pipe takes the\n\nsame time to come out of the pipe as it would take when dropped through the same height\n\nwithout the pipe. Note the time it takes to come out of the pipe in each case. You will  see that\n\nthe magnet takes much longer time in the case of aluminium pipe. Why is it so? It is due to\n\nthe eddy currents that are generated in the aluminium pipe which oppose the change in\n\nmagnetic flux, i.e., the motion of the magnet. The retarding force due to the eddy currents\n\ninhibits the motion of the magnet. Such phenomena are referred to as electromagnetic damping.\n\nNote that eddy currents are not generated in PVC pipe as its material is an insulator whereas\n\naluminium is a conductor.\n\n6.9  INDUCTANCE\nAn electric current can be induced in a coil by flux change produced by\nanother coil in its vicinity or flux change produced by the same coil. These\n\ntwo situations are described separately in the next two sub-sections.\nHowever, in both the cases, the flux through a coil is proportional to the\ncurrent. That is,  Φ\n\nB\n α I.\n\nFurther, if the geometry of the coil does not vary with time then,\n\nd d\n\nd d\nB I\n\nt t\n\nΦ\n∝\n\nFor a closely wound coil of N turns, the same magnetic flux is linked\n\nwith all the turns. When the flux Φ\nB\n through the coil changes, each turn\n\ncontributes to the induced emf. Therefore, a term called flux linkage is\nused which is equal to NΦ\n\nB\n for a closely wound coil and in such a case\n\nNΦ\nB ∝  I\n\nThe constant of proportionality, in this relation, is called inductance.\nWe shall see that inductance depends only on the geometry of the coil\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n220\n\nand intrinsic material properties. This aspect is akin to capacitance which\nfor a parallel plate capacitor depends on the plate area and plate separation\n\n(geometry) and the dielectric constant K of the intervening medium\n(intrinsic material property).\n\nInductance is a scalar quantity. It has the dimensions of [M L2 T –2 A–2]\n\ngiven by the dimensions of flux divided by the dimensions of current. The\nSI unit of inductance is henry and is denoted by H. It is named in honour\nof Joseph Henry who discovered electromagnetic induction in USA,\n\nindependently of Faraday in England.\n\n6.9.1  Mutual inductance\n\nConsider Fig. 6.15 which shows two long co-axial solenoids each of length\nl. We denote the radius of the inner solenoid S\n\n1\n by r\n\n1\n and the number of\n\nturns per unit length by n\n1\n. The corresponding quantities for the outer\n\nsolenoid S\n2 \nare r\n\n2 \nand n\n\n2\n, respectively. Let N\n\n1\n and N\n\n2\n be the total number\n\nof turns of coils S\n1\n and S\n\n2\n, respectively.\n\nWhen a current I\n2\n is set up through S\n\n2\n, it in turn sets up a magnetic\n\nflux through S\n1\n. Let us denote it by Φ\n\n1\n. The corresponding flux linkage\n\nwith  solenoid S\n1\n is\n\nN\n1 1 12 2\n\nM IΦ = (6.9)\nM\n\n12\n is called the mutual inductance of solenoid S\n\n1\n with respect to\n\nsolenoid S\n2\n. It is also referred to as the coefficient of mutual induction.\n\nFor these simple co-axial solenoids it is possible to calculate M\n12\n\n. The\nmagnetic field due to the current I\n\n2 \nin S\n\n2\n is µ\n\n0\nn\n\n2\nI\n2\n.

This is a good\n\napproximation keeping in mind that the solenoid is long,\nimplying l  >> r\n\n2\n.\n\nWe now consider the reverse case. A current I\n1 \n\nis\n\npassed through the solenoid S\n1 \nand the flux linkage with\n\ncoil S\n2 \nis,\n\nN\n2\nΦ\n\n2\n = M\n\n21\n I\n\n1\n(6.12)\n\nM\n21\n\n is called the mutual inductance of solenoid S\n2\n with\n\nrespect to solenoid S\n1\n.\n\nThe flux due to the current I\n1\n in S\n\n1 \ncan be assumed to\n\nbe confined solely inside S\n1\n since the solenoids are very\n\nlong. Thus, flux linkage with solenoid S\n2\n is\n\n( ) ( ) ( )22 2 2 1 0 1 1N n l r n IΦ µ= π\n\nFIGURE 6.15 Two long co-axial\nsolenoids of same\n\nlength l.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectromagnetic\n\nInduction\n\n221\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 6\n\n.9\n\nwhere n\n2\nl is the total number of turns of S\n\n2\n.

Note that if the inner solenoid\nwas much shorter than (and placed well inside) the outer solenoid, then\nwe could still have calculated the flux linkage N\n\n1\nΦ\n\n1\n because the inner\n\nsolenoid is effectively immersed in a uniform magnetic field due to the\nouter solenoid. In this case, the calculation of M\n\n12\n would be easy. However,\n\nit would be extremely difficult to calculate the flux linkage with the outer\n\nsolenoid as the magnetic field due to the inner solenoid would vary across\nthe length as well as cross section of the outer solenoid. Therefore, the\ncalculation of M\n\n21\n would also be extremely difficult in this case. The\n\nequality M\n12\n\n=M\n21\n\n is very useful in such situations.\nWe explained the above example with air as the medium within the\n\nsolenoids. Instead, if a medium of relative permeability µ\nr\n had been present,\n\nthe mutual inductance would be\n\nM =µ\nr \nµ\n\n0 \nn\n\n1\nn\n\n2\nπ r2\n\n1 \nl\n\nIt is also important to know that the mutual inductance of a pair of\ncoils, solenoids, etc., depends on their separation as well as their relative\norientation.\n\nExample 6.9 Two concentric circular coils, one of small radius r\n1\n and\n\nthe other of large radius r\n2\n, such that r\n\n1\n << r\n\n2\n,\n \n are placed co-axially\n\nwith centres coinciding.

Since the other\n\nco-axially placed coil has a very small radius, B\n2\n may be considered\n\nconstant over its cross-sectional area.

In that experiment,\nemf is induced in coil C\n\n1\n wherever there was any change in current through\n\ncoil C\n2\n. Let Φ\n\n1\n be the flux through coil C\n\n1\n (say of N\n\n1\n turns) when current in\n\ncoil C\n2\n is I\n\n2\n.\n\nThen, from Eq.

The magnitude of the induced emf depends upon the rate of change\nof current and mutual inductance of the two coils.\n\n6.9.2  Self-inductance\n\nIn the previous sub-section, we considered the flux in one solenoid due\n\nto the current in the other.  It is also possible that emf is induced in a\nsingle isolated coil due to change of flux through the coil by means of\nvarying the current through the same coil. This phenomenon is called\n\nself-induction. In this case, flux linkage through a coil of N turns is\nproportional to the current through the coil and is expressed as\n\nBN IΦ ∝\n\nB LN IΦ = (6.15)\nwhere constant of proportionality L is called self-inductance of the coil. It\nis also called the coefficient of self-induction of the coil. When the current\nis varied, the flux linked with the coil also changes and an emf is induced\n\nin the coil. Using Eq. (6.15), the induced emf is given by\n\n( )Bd\n–\n\nd\n\nN\n\nt\n\nΦ\nε =\n\nd\n–\n\nd\n\nI\nL\n\nt\nε = (6.16)\n\nThus, the self-induced emf always opposes any change  (increase or\ndecrease) of current in the coil.\n\nIt is possible to calculate the self-inductance for circuits with simple\n\ngeometries. Let us calculate the self-inductance of a long solenoid of cross-\nsectional area A and length l, having n turns per unit length.

An exceptionally important application is the\n\ngeneration of alternating currents (ac). The modern ac generator with a\ntypical output capacity of 100 MW is a highly evolved machine. In this\nsection, we shall describe the basic principles behind this machine. The\n\nYugoslav inventor Nicola Tesla is credited with the development of the\nmachine. As was pointed out in Section 6.3, one method to induce an emf\n\nIn\nte\n\nra\nc\nti\n\nv\ne\n a\n\nn\nim\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n o\nn\n\n a\nc\n g\n\ne\nn\n\ne\nra\n\nto\nr:\n\nh\ntt\np\n:/\n/m\n\nic\nro\n\n.m\na\ng\nn\ne\nt.\nfs\n\nu\n.e\n\nd\nu\n/e\n\nle\nc\ntr\no\nm\n\na\ng\n/j\na\nv\na\n/g\n\ne\nn\ne\nra\n\nto\nr/\na\nc\n.h\n\ntm\nl\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectromagnetic\n\nInduction\n\n225\n\nor current in a loop is through a change in the\nloop’s orientation or a change in its effective area.\n\nAs the coil rotates in a magnetic field B, the\neffective area of the loop (the face perpendicular\nto the field) is A cos θ, where θ is the angle\nbetween A and B. This method of producing a\nflux change is the principle of operation of a\nsimple ac generator. An ac generator converts\n\nmechanical energy into electrical energy.\nThe basic elements of an ac generator are\n\nshown in Fig. 6.16. It consists of a coil mounted\n\non a rotor shaft. The axis of rotation of the coil\nis perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic\nfield. The coil (called armature) is mechanically\n\nrotated in the  uniform magnetic field by some\nexternal means. The rotation of the coil causes\nthe magnetic flux through it to change, so an\n\nemf is induced in the coil. The ends of the coil\nare connected to an external circuit by means\nof slip rings and brushes.\n\nWhen the coil is rotated with a constant\nangular speed ω, the angle θ between the magnetic field vector B and the\narea vector A of the coil at any instant t is θ  = ωt (assuming θ = 0° at t = 0).\nAs a result, the effective area of the coil exposed to the magnetic field lines\nchanges with time, and from Eq. (6.1), the flux at any time t is\n\nΦ\nB\n = BA cos θ = BA cos ωt\n\nFrom Faraday’s law, the induced emf for the rotating coil of N turns is\nthen,\n\nd d\n– – (cos )\n\ndt d\nBN NBA t\n\nt\n\nΦ\nε ω= =\n\nThus, the instantaneous value of the emf is\n\nε ω ω= NBA sin t (6.21)\nwhere NBAω is the maximum value of the emf, which occurs when\nsin ωt = ±1. If we denote NBAω as ε\n\n0\n, then\n\nε = ε\n0\n sin ωt (6.22)\n\nSince the value of the sine fuction varies between +1 and –1, the sign, or\npolarity of the emf changes with time. Note from Fig. 6.17 that the emf\nhas its extremum value when θ = 90° or θ = 270°, as the change of flux is\ngreatest at these points.\n\nThe direction of the current changes periodically and therefore the current\nis called alternating current (ac). Since ω = 2πν, Eq (6.22) can be written as\n\nε = ε\n0\nsin 2π ν t (6.23)\n\nwhere ν is the frequency of revolution of the generator’s coil.\nNote that Eq. (6.22) and (6.23) give the instantaneous value of the emf\n\nand ε varies between +ε\n0\n and –ε\n\n0\n periodically. We shall learn how to\n\ndetermine the time-averaged value for the alternating voltage and current\nin the next chapter.\n\nFIGURE 6.16 AC Generator\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n226  E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 6\n\n.1\n1\n\nIn commercial generators, the mechanical energy required for rotation\n\nof the armature is provided by water falling from a height, for example,\nfrom dams. These are called hydro-electric generators. Alternatively, water\nis heated to produce steam using coal or other sources. The steam at\n\nhigh pressure produces the rotation of the armature. These are called\nthermal generators. Instead of coal, if a nuclear fuel is used, we get nuclear\npower generators. Modern day generators produce electric power as high\n\nas 500 MW, i.e., one can light up 5 million 100 W bulbs! In most\ngenerators, the coils are held stationary and it is the electromagnets which\nare rotated. The frequency of rotation is 50 Hz in India. In certain countries\n\nsuch as USA, it is 60 Hz.\n\nExample 6.11 Kamla peddles a stationary bicycle. The pedals of the\nbicycle are attached to a 100 turn coil of area 0.10 m2. The coil rotates\n\nat half a revolution per second and it is placed in a uniform magnetic\nfield of 0.01 T perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the coil. What is\nthe maximum voltage generated in the coil?\n\nSolution  Here ν = 0.5 Hz; N =100, A = 0.1 m2 and B = 0.01 T. Employing\nEq.

The magnetic flux through a surface of area A placed in a uniform magnetic\n\nfield B is defined as,\n\nΦ\nB\n = B.A = BA cos θ\n\nwhere θ is the angle between B and A.\n2. Faraday’s laws of induction imply that the emf induced in a coil of N\n\nturns is directly related to the rate of change of flux through it,\n\nBd\n\nd\nN\n\nt\n\nΦ\nε = −\n\nHere ΦΒ is the flux linked with one turn of the coil. If the circuit is\nclosed, a current I = ε/R is set up in it, where R is the resistance of the\ncircuit.\n\n3. Lenz’s law states that the polarity of the induced emf is such that it\n\ntends to produce a current which opposes the change in magnetic flux\n\nthat produces it. The negative sign in the expression for Faraday’s law\n\nindicates this fact.\n\n4. When a metal rod of length l is placed normal to a uniform magnetic\n\nfield B and moved with a velocity v perpendicular to the field, the\n\ninduced emf (called motional emf) across its ends is\n\nε = Bl v\n5. Changing magnetic fields can set up current loops in nearby metal\n\n(any conductor) bodies. They dissipate electrical energy as heat. Such\n\ncurrents are eddy currents.\n\n6. Inductance is the ratio of the flux-linkage to current. It is equal to NΦ/I.\n\nMIGRATION OF BIRDS\n\nThe migratory pattern of birds is one of the mysteries in the field of biology, and indeed all\nof science. For example, every winter birds from Siberia fly unerringly to water spots in the\nIndian subcontinent. There has been a suggestion that electromagnetic induction may\nprovide a clue to these migratory patterns. The earth’s magnetic field has existed throughout\nevolutionary history. It would be of great benefit to migratory birds to use this field to\ndetermine the direction. As far as we know birds contain no ferromagnetic material. So\nelectromagnetic induction seems to be the only reasonable mechanism to determine\ndirection. Consider the optimal case where the magnetic field B, the velocity of the bird v,\nand two relevant points of its anatomy separated by a distance l, all three are mutually\nperpendicular. From the formula for motional emf, Eq. (6.5),\n\nε = Blv\n\nTaking B = 4 × 10–5 T, l = 2 cm wide, and v = 10 m/s, we obtain\n\nε = 4 × 10–5 × 2 × 10–2 × 10 V = 8 × 10–6 V\n\n= 8 µV\nThis extremely small potential difference suggests that our hypothesis is of doubtful\n\nvalidity. Certain kinds of fish are able to detect small potential differences. However, in\nthese fish, special cells have been identified which detect small voltage differences. In birds\nno such cells have been identified. Thus, the migration patterns of birds continues to remain\na mystery.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n228\n\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n\n1. Electricity and magnetism are intimately related. In the early part of the\n\nnineteenth century, the experiments of Oersted, Ampere and others\n\nestablished that moving charges (currents) produce a magnetic field.\n\nSomewhat later, around 1830, the experiments of Faraday and Henry\n\ndemonstrated that a moving magnet can induce electric current.\n\n2. In a closed circuit, electric currents are induced so as to oppose the\n\nchanging magnetic flux. It is as per the law of conservation of energy.\n\nHowever, in case of an open circuit, an emf is induced across its ends.\n\nHow is it related to the flux change?\n\n3. The motional emf discussed in Section 6.5 can be argued independently\n\nfrom Faraday’s law using the Lorentz force on moving charges.

There exists a general equality,\n\nM\n12\n\n = M\n21\n\n8. When a current in a coil changes, it induces a back emf in the same\ncoil. The self-induced emf is given by,\n\nd\n\nd\n\nI\nL\n\nt\nε = −\n\nL is the self-inductance of the coil. It is a measure of the inertia of the\n\ncoil against the change of current through it.\n\n9.

In an ac generator, mechanical energy is converted to electrical energy\n\nby virtue of electromagnetic induction. If coil of N turn and area A is\n\nrotated at ν revolutions per second in a uniform magnetic field B, then\nthe motional emf produced is\n\nε = NBA (2πν) sin (2πνt)\nwhere we have assumed that at time t = 0 s, the coil is perpendicular to\n\nthe field.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectromagnetic\n\nInduction\n\n229\n\nEXERCISES\n\n6.1 Predict the direction of induced current in the situations described\nby the following Figs. 6.18(a) to (f ).\n\neven if the charges are stationary [and the q (v × B) term of the Lorentz\n\nforce is not operative], an emf is nevertheless induced in the presence of a\n\ntime-varying magnetic field. Thus, moving charges in static field and static\n\ncharges in a time-varying field seem to be symmetric situation for\n\nFaraday’s law. This gives a tantalising hint on the relevance of the principle\n\nof relativity for Faraday’s law.\n\n4.
