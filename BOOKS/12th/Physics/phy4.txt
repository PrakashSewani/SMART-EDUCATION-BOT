However, it was only about 200 years ago, in 1820, that it was\nrealised that they were intimately related*. During a lecture demonstration\n\nin the summer of 1820, Danish physicist Hans Christian Oersted noticed\nthat a current in a straight wire caused a noticeable deflection in a nearby\nmagnetic compass needle. He investigated this phenomenon. He found\n\nthat the alignment of the needle is tangential to an imaginary circle which\nhas the straight wire as its centre and has its plane perpendicular to the\nwire. This situation is depicted in Fig.4.1(a). It is noticeable when the\n\ncurrent is large and the needle sufficiently close to the wire so that the\nearth’s magnetic field may be ignored. Reversing the direction of the\ncurrent reverses the orientation of the needle [Fig. 4.1(b)]. The deflection\n\nincreases on increasing the current or bringing the needle closer to the\nwire. Iron filings sprinkled around the wire arrange themselves in\nconcentric circles with the wire as the centre [Fig. 4.1(c)]. Oersted\n\nconcluded that moving charges or currents produced a magnetic field\nin the surrounding space.\n\nFollowing this, there was intense experimentation. In 1864, the laws\n\nobeyed by electricity and magnetism were unified and formulated by\n\nChapter Four\n\nMOVING CHARGES\n\nAND MAGNETISM\n\n* See the box in Chapter 1, Page 3.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nMoving Charges and\n\nMagnetism\n\n133\n\nJames Maxwell who then realised that light was electromagnetic waves.\nRadio waves were discovered by Hertz, and produced by  J.C.Bose and\n\nG. Marconi by the end of the 19\nth\n\n century. A  remarkable scientific and\ntechnological progress took place in the 20\n\nth\n century. This was due to\n\nour increased understanding of electromagnetism and the invention of\n\ndevices for production, amplification, transmission and detection of\nelectromagnetic waves.\n\nIn this chapter, we will see how magnetic field exerts\n\nforces on moving charged particles, like electrons,\n\nprotons, and current-carrying wires. We shall also learn\n\nhow currents produce magnetic fields. We shall see how\n\nparticles can be accelerated to very high energies in a\n\ncyclotron. We shall study how currents and voltages are\n\ndetected by a galvanometer.\n\nIn this and subsequent Chapter on magnetism,\n\nwe adopt the following convention: A current or a\nfield (electric or magnetic) emerging out of the plane of the\npaper is depicted by a dot (¤). A current or a field going\n\ninto the plane of the paper is depicted by a cross ( ⊗ )*.\nFigures. 4.1(a) and 4.1(b) correspond to these two\nsituations, respectively.\n\n4.2  MAGNETIC FORCE\n\n4.2.1  Sources and fields\n\nBefore we introduce the concept of a magnetic field B, we\n\nshall recapitulate what we have learnt in Chapter 1 about\n\nthe electric field E. We have seen that the interaction\n\nbetween two charges can be considered in two stages.\n\nThe charge Q, the source of the field, produces an electric\n\nfield E, where\n\nFIGURE 4.1 The magnetic field due to a straight long current-carrying\n\nwire. The wire is perpendicular to the plane of the paper. A ring of\ncompass needles surrounds the wire. The orientation of the needles is\n\nshown when (a) the current emerges out of the plane of the paper,\n\n(b) the current moves into the plane of the paper. (c) The arrangement of\niron filings around the wire. The darkened ends of the needle represent\n\nnorth poles. The effect of the earth’s magnetic field is neglected.\n\nHans Christian Oersted\n(1777–1851) Danish\n\nphysicist and chemist,\nprofessor at Copenhagen.\nHe observed that a\n\ncompass needle suffers a\ndeflection when placed\nnear a wire carrying an\n\nelectric current. This\ndiscovery gave the first\nempirical evidence of a\n\nconnection between electric\nand magnetic phenomena.\n\nH\nA\n\nN\nS\n\n C\nH\n\nR\nIS\n\nT\nIA\n\nN\n O\n\nE\nR\n\nS\nT\nE\n\nD\n  (1\n\n7\n7\n7\n–\n1\n8\n5\n1\n)\n\n* A dot appears like the tip of an arrow pointed at you, a cross is like the feathered\ntail of an arrow moving away from you.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n134\n\nE = Q \n\nr\n\n/ (4πε\n0\n)r\n\n2\n(4.1)\n\nwhere r̂  is unit vector along r,  and  the field E is a vector\nfield. A charge q interacts with this field and experiences\n\na force F given by\n\n     F  =  q  E   = q Q r̂   / (4πε\n0\n) r\n\n2\n(4.2)\n\nAs pointed out in the Chapter 1, the field  E is not\n\njust an artefact but has a physical role. It can  convey\n\nenergy and momentum and is not established\n\ninstantaneously but takes finite time to propagate. The\n\nconcept of a field was specially stressed by Faraday  and\n\nwas incorporated by Maxwell in his unification of\n\nelectricity and magnetism. In addition to depending on\n\neach point in space, it can also vary with time, i.e., be a\n\nfunction of time.  In our discussions in this chapter, we\n\nwill assume that the fields do not change with time.\n\nThe field at a particular point can be due to one or\n\nmore charges. If there are more charges the fields add\n\nvectorially. You have already learnt in Chapter 1 that\n\nthis is called the principle of superposition. Once the field\n\nis known, the force on a test charge is given by Eq. (4.2).\n\nJust as static charges produce an electric field, the\n\ncurrents or moving charges produce (in addition) a\n\nmagnetic field, denoted by B (r), again a vector field. It\n\nhas several basic properties identical to the electric field.\n\nIt is defined at each point in space (and can in addition\n\ndepend on time). Experimentally, it is found to obey the\n\nprinciple of superposition: the magnetic field of several\n\nsources is the vector addition of magnetic field of each\n\nindividual source.\n\n4.2.2  Magnetic Field,  Lorentz  Force\n\nLet us suppose that there is  a point charge q (moving\n\nwith a velocity v and, located at r at a given time t ) in\npresence of both the electric field E (r) and the magnetic\nfield B (r).  The force on an electric charge q due to both\n\nof them can be written as\n\nF   = q [ E (r) +  v × B (r)] ≡ F\nelectric\n\n +F\nmagnetic\n\n(4.3)\n\nThis force was given first  by H.A. Lorentz based on the extensive\n\nexperiments of Ampere and others. It is called the Lorentz force. You\nhave already studied in detail the force due to the electric field. If we\nlook at the interaction with the magnetic field, we find the following\n\nfeatures.\n(i) It depends on q, v and B (charge of the particle, the velocity and the\n\nmagnetic field). Force on a negative charge is opposite to that on a\n\npositive charge.\n\n(ii) The magnetic force q [ v × B ] includes a vector product of velocity\nand magnetic field. The vector product makes the force due to magnetic\n\nH\nE\n\nN\nD\n\nR\nIK\n\n A\nN\n\nT\nO\n\nO\nN\n\n L\nO\n\nR\nE\n\nN\nT\nZ\n (\n\n1\n8\n5\n3\n –\n\n 1\n9\n2\n8\n)\n\nHendrik Antoon Lorentz\n(1853 – 1928) Dutch\n\ntheoretical physicist,\nprofessor at Leiden. He\ninvestigated the relationship\n\nbetween electricity, magnetism,\nand mechanics. In order to\nexplain the observed effect of\n\nmagnetic fields on emitters of\nlight (Zeeman effect), he\npostulated the existence of\n\nelectric charges in the atom,\nfor which he was awarded the\nNobel Prize in 1902. He derived\n\na set of  transformation\nequations (known after him,\nas Lorentz transformation\n\nequations) by some tangled\nmathematical arguments, but\nhe was not aware that these\n\nequations hinge on a new\nconcept of space and time.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nMoving Charges and\n\nMagnetism\n\n135\n\nfield vanish (become zero) if  velocity and magnetic field are parallel\nor anti-parallel. The force acts in a (sideways) direction perpendicular\n\nto both the velocity and the magnetic field.\nIts direction  is given by the screw rule or\nright hand rule  for vector (or cross) product\n\nas illustrated in Fig. 4.2.\n(iii) The magnetic force is zero if  charge is not\n\nmoving (as then |v|= 0).  Only a moving\n\ncharge feels the magnetic force.\nThe expression for the magnetic force helps\n\nus to define the unit of the magnetic field, if\n\none takes q, F and v, all to be unity in the force\n\nequation F = q [ v × B] =q v B sin θ n̂ ,  where θ\nis the angle between v and B [see  Fig. 4.2 (a)].\n\nThe magnitude of magnetic field B is 1 SI unit,\nwhen the force acting on a unit charge (1 C),\nmoving perpendicular to B with a speed 1m/s,\n\nis one newton.\nDimensionally, we have [B] = [F/qv] and the unit\nof B are Newton second / (coulomb metre).  This\n\nunit is called tesla (T) named after Nikola Tesla\n(1856 – 1943). Tesla is a rather large unit. A smaller  unit (non-SI) called\ngauss (=10–4 tesla) is also often used. The earth’s magnetic field is about\n\n3.6 × 10\n–5\n\n T. Table  4.1 lists magnetic fields over a wide range in the\nuniverse.\n\nFIGURE 4.2 The direction of the magnetic\nforce acting on a charged particle. (a) The\n\nforce on a positively charged particle with\nvelocity v and making an angle θ with the\nmagnetic field B is given by the right-hand\n\nrule. (b) A moving charged particle q is\ndeflected in an opposite sense to –q in the\n\npresence of magnetic field.\n\nTABLE 4.1 ORDER OF MAGNITUDES OF MAGNETIC FIELDS IN A VARIETY OF PHYSICAL SITUATIONS\n\nPhysical situation Magnitude of B (in tesla)\n\nSurface of a neutron star 108\n\nTypical large field in a laboratory    1\n\nNear a small bar magnet 10\n–2\n\nOn the earth’s surface 10–5\n\nHuman nerve fibre 10\n–10\n\nInterstellar space 10\n–12\n\n4.2.3  Magnetic force on a current-carrying conductor\n\nWe can extend the analysis for force due to magnetic field on a single\nmoving charge to a straight rod carrying current. Consider a rod of a\n\nuniform cross-sectional area A and length l. We shall assume one kind\nof mobile carriers as in a conductor (here electrons). Let the number\ndensity of these mobile charge carriers in it be n. Then the total number\n\nof mobile charge carriers in it is nlA. For a steady current I in this\nconducting rod, we may assume that each mobile carrier has an average\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n136  E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 4\n\n.1\n\ndrift velocity v\nd\n (see Chapter 3). In the presence of an external magnetic\n\nfield B, the force on these carriers is:\n\nF = (nlA)q v\nd\n ××××× B\n\nwhere q is the value of the charge on  a carrier.  Now nq v\nd\n is the current\n\ndensity j and |(nq v\nd\n)|A is the current I (see Chapter 3 for the discussion\n\nof current and current density). Thus,\n\nF = [(nq v\nd \n)lA] × B = [ jAl ] ××××× B\n\n   = Il ××××× B (4.4)\n\nwhere l is a vector of magnitude l, the length of the rod, and with a direction\nidentical to the current I. Note that the current I is not a vector. In the last\nstep leading to Eq. (4.4), we have transferred the vector sign from  j to l.\n\nEquation (4.4) holds for a straight rod. In this equation, B is the external\nmagnetic field. It is not the field produced by the current-carrying rod. If\nthe wire has an arbitrary shape we can calculate the Lorentz force on it\n\nby considering it as a collection of linear strips dl\nj\n and summing\n\nj\nj\n\nId ×= ∑F Bl\n\nThis summation can be converted to an integral in most cases.\n\nON PERMITTIVITY AND PERMEABILITY\n\nIn the universal law of gravitation, we say that any two point masses exert a force on\neach other which is proportional to the product of the masses m\n\n1\n, m\n\n2\n and inversely\n\nproportional to the square of the distance r between them. We write it as F = Gm\n1\nm\n\n2\n/r\n\n2\n\nwhere G is the universal constant of gravitation. Similarly, in Coulomb’s law of electrostatics\nwe write the force between two point charges q\n\n1\n, q\n\n2\n, separated by a distance r as\n\nF = kq\n1\nq\n\n2\n/r\n\n2\n where k is a constant of proportionality. In SI units, k is taken as\n\n1/4πε where ε is the permittivity of the medium. Also in magnetism, we get another\nconstant, which in SI units, is taken as µ/4π where µ is the permeability of the medium.\n\nAlthough G, ε and µ arise as proportionality constants, there is a difference between\ngravitational force and electromagnetic force. While the gravitational force does not depend\non the intervening medium, the electromagnetic force depends on the medium between\n\nthe two charges or magnets. Hence, while G is a universal constant, ε and µ depend on\nthe medium. They have different values for different media. The product εµ turns out to\nbe related to the speed v of electromagnetic radiation in the medium through εµ =1/ v\n\n 2\n.\n\nElectric permittivity ε is a physical quantity that describes how an electric field affects\nand is affected by a medium. It is determined by the ability of a material to polarise in\nresponse to an applied field, and thereby to cancel, partially, the field inside the material.\n\nSimilarly, magnetic permeability µ is the ability of a substance to acquire magnetisation in\nmagnetic fields. It is a measure of the extent to which magnetic field can penetrate matter.\n\nExample 4.1 A straight wire of mass 200 g and length 1.5 m carries\n\na current of 2 A. It is suspended in mid-air by a uniform horizontal\nmagnetic field B (Fig. 4.3). What is the magnitude of the magnetic\nfield?\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nMoving Charges and\n\nMagnetism\n\n137\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 4\n\n.1\nFIGURE 4.3\n\nSolution  From Eq. (4.4), we find that there is an upward force F, of\nmagnitude IlB,. For mid-air suspension, this must be balanced by\nthe force due to gravity:\n\nm g = I lB\n\n  \nm g\n\nB\nI l\n\n=\n\n     \n0.2 9.8\n\n0.65 T\n2 1.5\n\n×\n= =\n\n×\n\nNote that it would have been sufficient to specify m/l, the mass per\n\nunit length of the wire. The earth’s magnetic field is approximately\n4 × 10\n\n–5\n T and we have ignored it.\n\nExample 4.2 If the magnetic field is parallel to the positive y-axis\nand the charged particle is moving along the positive x-axis (Fig. 4.4),\nwhich way would the Lorentz force be for (a) an electron (negative\n\ncharge), (b) a proton (positive charge).\n\nFIGURE 4.4\n\nSolution   The velocity v of particle is along the x-axis, while B, the\nmagnetic field is along the y-axis, so v × B is along the z-axis (screw\nrule or right-hand thumb rule). So, (a) for electron it will be along –z\n\naxis. (b) for a positive charge (proton) the force is along +z axis.\n\n4.3  MOTION IN A MAGNETIC FIELD\nWe will now consider, in greater detail, the motion of a charge moving in\n\na  magnetic field.  We have learnt  in Mechanics (see Class XI book, Chapter\n\n6) that a force on a particle does work if  the force has a component along\n\n(or opposed to) the direction of motion of the particle.

So no work is done\n\nand no change in the magnitude of the velocity is produced\n(though the direction of momentum may be changed). [Notice\nthat this is unlike the force due to an electric field, qE, which\n\ncan have a component parallel (or antiparallel) to motion and\nthus can transfer energy in addition to momentum.]\n\nWe shall consider motion of a charged particle in a uniform\n\nmagnetic field. First consider the case of v perpendicular to B.\nThe perpendicular force, q v × B, acts as a centripetal force and\nproduces a circular motion perpendicular to the magnetic field.\n\nThe particle will describe a circle if v and B are  perpendicular\nto each other (Fig. 4.5).\n\nIf velocity has a component along B, this component\n\nremains unchanged as the motion along the magnetic field will\nnot be affected by the magnetic field. The motion\nin a plane perpendicular to B is as before a\n\ncircular one, thereby producing a helical motion\n(Fig. 4.6).\n\nYou have already learnt in earlier classes\n\n(See Class XI, Chapter 4) that if r is the radius\nof the circular path of a particle,  then a force of\nm v\n\n2 / r, acts perpendicular to the path towards\n\nthe centre of the circle, and is called the\ncentripetal force. If the velocity v is\nperpendicular to the magnetic field   B, the\n\nmagnetic force is  perpendicular to both v and\nB and acts like a centripetal force. It has a\nmagnitude q v B. Equating the two expressions\n\nfor centripetal force,\n\nm v\n 2\n/r = q v B, which gives\n\nr =  m v / qB (4.5)\n\nfor the radius of the circle described by the\ncharged particle. The larger the  momentum,\n\nthe larger is the radius and bigger the circle described. If ω is the angular\n\nfrequency, then   v = ω  r. So,\n\nω  = 2π ν =  q B/ m [4.6(a)]\n\nwhich is independent of the velocity or energy . Here ν is the frequency of\nrotation. The independence of ν from energy has important application\n\nin the design of a cyclotron (see Section 4.4.2).\nThe time taken for one revolution is T= 2π/ω  ≡ 1/ν. If there is a\n\ncomponent of the velocity parallel to the magnetic field (denoted by v\n||\n), it\n\nwill make the particle move along the field and the path of the particle\nwould be a helical one (Fig. 4.6). The distance moved along the magnetic\nfield  in one rotation is called pitch p.  Using Eq. [4.6 (a)], we have\n\np =   v\n||\nT  =  2πm v\n\n||\n / q B [4.6(b)]\n\nThe radius of the circular component of motion is called the radius of\nthe helix.\n\nFIGURE 4.5 Circular motion\n\nFIGURE 4.6 Helical motion\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nMoving Charges and\n\nMagnetism\n\n139\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 4\n\n.3\n\nExample  4.3   What is the radius of the path of an electron (mass\n\n9 × 10\n-31\n\n kg and charge 1.6 × 10\n–19\n\n C) moving at a speed of 3 ×10\n7\n m/s in\n\na magnetic field of 6 × 10\n–4\n\n T perpendicular to it?

The appearance of dancing green pink lights is fascinating, and equally\npuzzling. An explanation of this natural phenomenon is now found in physics, in terms\nof what we have studied here.\n\nConsider a charged particle of  mass m and charge q, entering a region of magnetic\nfield B with an initial velocity v. Let this velocity have a component v\n\np\n parallel to the\n\nmagnetic field and a component v\nn\n normal to it. There is no force on a charged particle in\n\nthe direction of the field. Hence the particle continues to travel with the velocity v\np\n parallel\n\nto the field. The normal component v\nn\n of the particle results in a Lorentz force (v\n\nn\n × B)\n\nwhich is perpendicular to both v\nn\n and B. As seen in Section 4.3.1 the particle thus has a\n\ntendency to perform a circular motion in a plane perpendicular to the magnetic field.\nWhen this is coupled with the velocity parallel to the field, the resulting trajectory will be\na helix along the magnetic field line, as shown in Figure (a) here. Even if the field line\nbends, the helically moving particle is trapped and guided to move around the field line.\nSince the Lorentz force is normal to the velocity of each point, the field does no work on\nthe particle and the magnitude of velocity remains the same.\n\nDuring a solar flare, a large number of electrons and protons are ejected from the sun.\nSome of them get trapped in the earth’s magnetic field and move in helical paths along the\nfield lines. The field lines come closer to each other near the magnetic poles; see figure (b).\nHence the density of charges increases near the poles. These particles collide with atoms\nand molecules of the atmosphere. Excited oxygen atoms emit green light and excited\nnitrogen atoms emits pink light. This phenomenon is called Aurora Borealis in physics.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n140\n\n4.4 MOTION IN COMBINED ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC\nFIELDS\n\n4.4.1  Velocity selector\n\nYou know that a charge q moving with velocity v in presence of both\nelectric and magnetic fields experiences a force given by Eq. (4.3), that is,\n\nF = q (E + v × B) = F\nE\n + F\n\nB\n\nWe shall consider the simple case in which electric and magnetic\nfields are perpendicular to each other and also perpendicular to\nthe velocity of the particle, as shown in Fig. 4.7. We have,\n\nˆ ˆ ˆ, ,\uf03d \uf03d \uf03dE j B k v iE B v\n\n( )ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ, , –= = = = =F E j F v × B i × k jE Bq qE q q v B qvB\nTherefore, ( ) ˆ–q E vB=F j .\n\nThus, electric and magnetic forces are in opposite directions as\nshown in the figure. Suppose, we adjust the value of E and B such\nthat magnitudes of the two forces are equal. Then, total force on\nthe charge is zero and the charge will move in the fields undeflected.\nThis happens when,\n\nor\nE\n\nqE qvB v\nB\n\n= = (4.7)\n\nThis condition can be used to select charged particles of a particular\nvelocity out of a beam containing charges moving with different speeds\n(irrespective of their charge and mass). The crossed E and B fields, therefore,\nserve as a velocity selector. Only particles with speed E/B pass\nundeflected through the region of crossed fields. This method was\nemployed by J. J. Thomson in 1897 to measure the charge to mass ratio\n(e/m) of an electron. The principle is also employed in Mass Spectrometer –\na device that separates charged particles, usually ions, according to their\ncharge to mass ratio.\n\n4.4.2  Cyclotron\n\nThe cyclotron is a machine to accelerate charged particles or ions to high\nenergies. It was invented by E.O. Lawrence and M.S. Livingston in 1934\nto investigate nuclear structure. The cyclotron uses both electric and\nmagnetic fields in combination to increase the energy of charged particles.\nAs the fields are perpendicular to each other they are called crossed\nfields. Cyclotron uses the fact that the frequency of revolution of the\ncharged particle in a magnetic field is independent of its energy. The\nparticles move most of the time inside two semicircular disc-like metal\ncontainers, D\n\n1\n and D\n\n2\n, which are called dees as they look like the letter\n\nD. Figure 4.8 shows a schematic view of the cyclotron.  Inside the metal\nboxes the particle is shielded and is not acted on by the electric field. The\nmagnetic field, however, acts on the particle and makes it go round in a\ncircular path inside a dee. Every time the particle moves from one dee to\nanother it is acted upon by the electric field. The sign of the electric field\nis changed alternately in tune with the circular motion of the particle.\nThis ensures that the particle is always accelerated by the electric field.\nEach time the acceleration increases the energy of the particle. As energy\n\nFIGURE 4.7\n\nC\ny\nc\nlo\n\ntr\no\n\nn\n\nIn\nte\n\nra\nc\nti\n\nv\ne\n \nd\n\ne\nm\n\no\nn\n\ns\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n:\n\nh\ntt\np\n:/\n/w\n\nw\nw\n\n.p\nh\ny\n.n\n\ntn\nu\n.e\n\nd\nu\n.t\nw\n\n/n\ntn\n\nu\nja\n\nv\na\n/i\nn\nd\ne\nx\n.p\n\nh\np\n?t\n\no\np\nic\n\n=\n3\n3\n.0\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nMoving Charges and\n\nMagnetism\n\n141\n\nincreases, the radius of the circular path increases. So the path is a\nspiral one.\n\nThe whole assembly is evacuated to minimise collisions between the\nions and the air molecules. A high frequency alternating voltage is applied\nto the dees. In the sketch shown in Fig. 4.8, positive ions or positively\n\ncharged particles (e.g., protons) are released at the centre P. They move\nin a semi-circular path in one of the dees and arrive in the gap between\nthe dees in a time interval T/2; where T, the period of revolution, is given\n\nby Eq. (4.6),\n\n \n1 2\n\nc\n\nm\nT\n\nqBν\n\nπ\n= =\n\nor \n2\n\nc\n\nqB\n\nm\nν =\n\nπ\n(4.8)\n\nThis frequency is called the cyclotron frequency for obvious reasons\nand is denoted by ν\n\nc \n.\n\nThe frequency ν\na\n of the applied voltage is adjusted so that the polarity\n\nof the dees is reversed in the same time that it takes the ions to complete\n\none half of the revolution. The requirement ν\na\n = ν\n\nc\n is called the resonance\n\ncondition. The phase of the supply is adjusted so that when the positive\n\nions arrive at the edge of D\n1\n, D\n\n2\n is at a lower\n\npotential and the ions are accelerated across the\n\ngap. Inside the dees the particles travel in a region\n\nfree of the electric field. The increase in their\n\nkinetic energy is qV each time they cross from\n\none dee to another (V refers to the voltage across\n\nthe dees at that time). From Eq. (4.5), it is clear\n\nthat the radius of their path goes on increasing\n\neach time their kinetic energy increases. The ions\n\nare repeatedly accelerated across the dees until\n\nthey have the required energy to have a radius\n\napproximately that of the dees. They are then\n\ndeflected by a magnetic field and leave the system\n\nvia an exit slit. From Eq. (4.5) we have,\n\nqBR\nv\n\nm\n= (4.9)\n\nwhere R is the radius of the trajectory at exit, and\n\nequals the radius of a dee.\nHence, the kinetic energy of the ions is,\n\n2 2 2\n21\n\n2 2\n\nq B R\nm\n\nm\n=v (4.10)\n\nThe operation of the cyclotron is based on the\nfact that the time for one revolution of an ion is\nindependent of its speed or radius of its orbit.\n\nThe cyclotron is used to bombard nuclei with\nenergetic particles, so accelerated by it, and study\n\nFIGURE 4.8 A schematic sketch of the\n\ncyclotron. There is a source of charged\nparticles or ions at P which move in a\n\ncircular fashion in the dees, D\n1\n and D\n\n2\n, on\n\naccount of a uniform perpendicular\nmagnetic field B. An alternating voltage\nsource accelerates these ions to high\n\nspeeds.

The vision of\nDr. Meghnath Saha created a 37" Cyclotron in the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics in\nKolkata in 1953. This was soon followed by a series of  Cockroft-Walton  type of accelerators\nestablished in Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Mumbai, Aligarh Muslim\nUniversity (AMU), Aligarh, Bose Institute, Kolkata and Andhra University, Waltair.\n\nThe sixties saw the commissioning of a number of Van de Graaff accelerators: a 5.5 MV\nterminal machine in Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), Mumbai (1963); a 2 MV terminal\nmachine in Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur; a 400 kV terminal machine in Banaras\nHindu University (BHU), Varanasi; and Punjabi University, Patiala. One 66 cm Cyclotron\ndonated by the Rochester University of USA was commissioned in Panjab University,\nChandigarh. A small  electron accelerator was also established in University of Pune, Pune.\n\nIn a major initiative taken in the seventies  and eighties, a Variable Energy Cyclotron was\nbuilt indigenously in Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre (VECC), Kolkata; 2 MV Tandem Van\nde Graaff accelerator was developed and built in BARC and a 14 MV Tandem Pelletron\naccelerator  was installed in TIFR.\n\nThis was soon followed by a 15 MV Tandem Pelletron established by University Grants\nCommission (UGC), as an inter-university facility in Inter-University Accelerator Centre\n(IUAC), New Delhi; a 3 MV Tandem Pelletron in Institute of Physics, Bhubaneswar; and two\n1.7 MV Tandetrons in Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research, Hyderabad\nand Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research, Kalpakkam. Both TIFR and IUAC  are\naugmenting their facilities with the addition of superconducting LINAC modules to accelerate\nthe ions to higher energies.\n\nBesides these ion accelerators, the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) has developed\nmany electron accelerators. A 2 GeV Synchrotron Radiation Source is being built in Raja\nRamanna Centre for Advanced Technologies, Indore.\n\nThe Department of Atomic Energy is considering Accelerator Driven Systems (ADS) for\npower production and fissile material breeding as future options.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nMoving Charges and\n\nMagnetism\n\n143\n\n4.5 MAGNETIC FIELD DUE TO A CURRENT ELEMENT,\nBIOT-SAVART LAW\n\nAll magnetic fields that we know are due to currents (or moving charges)\n\nand due to intrinsic magnetic moments of particles. Here, we\nshall study the relation between current and the magnetic field\nit produces. It is given by the Biot-Savart’s  law. Figure 4.9 shows\n\na finite conductor XY carrying current I. Consider an infinitesimal\nelement dl of the conductor. The magnetic field dB due to this\nelement is to be determined at a point P which is at a distance r\n\nfrom it. Let θ be the angle between dl and the displacement vector\nr. According to Biot-Savart’s law, the magnitude of the magnetic\nfield dB is proportional to the current I, the element length |dl|,\n\nand inversely proportional to the square of the distance r. Its\ndirection* is perpendicular to the plane containing dl and r .\nThus, in vector notation,\n\n3\n\nI d\nd\n\nr\n\n×\n∝\n\nr\nB\n\nl\n\n           \n0\n\n3\n4\n\nI d\n\nr\n\nµ ×\n=\n\nπ\n\nrl\n [4.11(a)]\n\nwhere µ\n0\n/4π is a constant of proportionality. The above\n\nexpression holds when the medium is vacuum.\n\nThe magnitude of this field is,\n\n0\n\n2\n\nd sin\nd\n\n4\n\nI l\n\nr\n\nµ θ\n=\n\nπ\nB [4.11(b)]\n\nwhere we have used the property of cross-product. Equation [4.11 (a)]\n\nconstitutes our basic equation for the magnetic field.  The proportionality\nconstant in SI units has the exact value,\n\n70 10 Tm/A\n4\n\nµ −\n=\n\nπ\n[4.11(c)]\n\nWe call µ\n0\n the permeability of free space (or vacuum).\n\nThe Biot-Savart law for the magnetic field has certain similarities, as\n\nwell as, differences with the Coulomb’s law for the electrostatic field. Some\nof these are:\n(i) Both are long range, since both depend inversely on the square of\n\ndistance from the source to the point of interest. The principle of\nsuperposition applies to both fields. [In this connection, note that\nthe magnetic field is linear in the source I dl just as the electrostatic\n\nfield is linear in its source: the electric charge.]\n(ii) The  electrostatic field is produced by a scalar source, namely, the\n\nelectric charge. The magnetic field is produced by a vector source\n\nI dl.\n\n* The sense of  dl × r is also given by the Right Hand Screw rule : Look at the\nplane containing vectors dl and r. Imagine moving from the first vector towards\nsecond vector. If the movement is anticlockwise, the resultant is towards you.\nIf it is clockwise, the resultant is away from you.\n\nFIGURE 4.9 Illustration of\nthe Biot-Savart law. The\n\ncurrent element I dl\nproduces a field dB at a\ndistance r. The ⊗ sign\n\nindicates that the\nfield is perpendicular\n\nto the plane of this\n\npage and directed\ninto it.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n144  E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 4\n\n.5\n\n(iii) The electrostatic field is along the displacement vector joining the\nsource and the field point. The magnetic field is perpendicular to the\n\nplane  containing the displacement vector r and the current element\nI dl.\n\n(iv) There is an angle dependence in the Biot-Savart law which is not\n\npresent  in the electrostatic case. In Fig. 4.9, the magnetic field at any\npoint in  the direction of dl (the dashed line) is zero. Along this line,\nθ = 0, sin θ = 0 and from Eq. [4.11(a)], |dB| = 0.\n\nThere is an interesting  relation between ε\n0\n, the permittivity of free\n\nspace; µ\n0\n, the permeability of free space; and c, the speed of light in\n\nvacuum:\n\n( ) 00 0 04\n4\n\nµ\nε µ ε\n\n  \n= π\n\n  \n  π\n\n ( )79\n1\n\n10\n9 10\n\n−  \n=   \n\n  ×\n8 2 2\n\n1 1\n\n(3 10 ) c\n= =\n\n×\n\nWe will discuss this connection further in Chapter 8 on the\n\nelectromagnetic waves. Since the speed of light in vacuum is constant,\nthe product µ\n\n0\nε\n\n0\n is fixed in magnitude. Choosing the value of either ε\n\n0\n or\n\nµ\n0\n, fixes the value of the other.

The evaluation entails summing up the effect of infinitesimal\ncurrent elements (I dl) mentioned in the previous section.\n\nWe assume that the current I is steady and that the\nevaluation is carried out in free space (i.e., vacuum).\n\nFigure 4.11 depicts a circular loop carrying a steady\n\ncurrent I. The loop is placed in the y-z plane with its\ncentre at the origin O and has a radius R. The x-axis is\nthe axis of the loop. We wish to calculate the magnetic\n\nfield at the point P on this axis. Let x be the distance of\nP from the centre O of the loop.\n\nConsider a conducting element dl of the loop. This is\n\nshown in Fig. 4.11. The magnitude dB of the magnetic\nfield due to dl is given by the Biot-Savart law [Eq. 4.11(a)],\n\n0\n\n3\n4\n\n=\n× rI d\n\ndB\nr\n\nµ\n\nπ\n\nl\n(4.12)\n\nNow r\n2\n = x\n\n2\n + R\n\n2\n . Further, any element of the loop\n\nwill be perpendicular to the displacement vector from\nthe element to the axial point. For example, the element\n\ndl in Fig. 4.11 is in the y-z plane, whereas, the\ndisplacement vector r from dl to the axial point P is in\nthe x-y plane. Hence |dl × r|=r dl.

It has an x-component dB\nx\n and a component\n\nperpendicular to x-axis, dB\n⊥\n. When the components perpendicular to\n\nthe x-axis are summed over, they cancel out and we obtain a null result.\n\nFor example, the dB\n⊥\n component due to dl is cancelled by the contribution\n\ndue to the diametrically opposite dl element, shown in\nFig. 4.11. Thus, only the x-component survives. The net contribution\n\nalong x-direction can be obtained by integrating dB\nx\n  = dB cos θ over the\n\nloop.

The right-hand thumb\n\ngives the direction of the magnetic field.\n\nExample 4.6 A straight wire carrying a current of 12 A is bent into a\nsemi-circular arc of radius 2.0 cm as shown in Fig. 4.13(a).

Ampere’s circuital law considers an open surface with\n\na boundary (Fig. 4.14). The surface has current passing through\n\nit. We consider the boundary to be made up of a number of small\n\nline elements. Consider one such element of length dl. We take\n\nthe value of the tangential component of the magnetic field, B\nt\n,\n \nat\n\nthis element and multiply it by the length of that element dl [Note:\n\nB\nt\ndl=B.d l]. All such products are added together. We consider\n\nthe limit as the lengths of elements get smaller and their number\n\ngets larger. The sum then tends to an integral. Ampere’s   law\n\nstates that this integral is  equal to µ\n0\n times the total current\n\npassing through  the surface,  i.e.,\n\n“B.dl.d Il = µ0 [4.17(a)]\nwhere I  is the total current through the surface. The integral is taken\n\nover the closed loop coinciding with the boundary C of the surface. The\n\nrelation above involves a sign-convention, given by the right-hand rule.\n\nLet the fingers of the right-hand be curled in the sense the boundary is\n\ntraversed in the loop integral “B.dl. Then the direction of the thumb\ngives the sense in which the current I  is regarded as positive.\n\nFor several applications, a much simplified version of Eq. [4.17(a)]\n\nproves sufficient. We shall assume that, in such cases, it is possible to\n\nchoose the loop (called an amperian loop) such that at each point of the\n\nloop, either\n\nFIGURE 4.14\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 4\n\n.7\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n148\n\n(i) B is tangential to the loop and is a non-zero constant\nB, or\n\n(ii) B is normal to the loop, or\n\n(iii) B vanishes.\nNow, let L be the length (part) of the  loop for which B\n\nis tangential. Let I\ne\n  be the current enclosed by the loop.\n\nThen, Eq. (4.17) reduces to,\n\nBL =µ\n0\nI\ne\n\n[4.17(b)]\n\nWhen there is a system with a symmetry such as for\n\na straight infinite current-carrying wire in Fig. 4.15, the\nAmpere’s law enables an easy evaluation of the magnetic\nfield, much the same way Gauss’ law helps in\n\ndetermination of the electric field. This is exhibited in the\nExample 4.9 below. The boundary of the loop chosen is\na circle and magnetic field is tangential to the\n\ncircumference of the circle. The law gives, for the left hand\nside of Eq. [4.17 (b)], B. 2πr. We find that the magnetic\nfield at a distance r outside the wire is tangential and\n\ngiven by\n\nB × 2πr  =  µ\n0 \nI,\n\nB = µ\n0 \n I/ (2πr) (4.18)\n\nThe above result for the infinite wire  is interesting\nfrom several points of view.\n\n(i) It implies that the field at every point on a circle of\nradius r, (with the wire along the axis), is same in\nmagnitude. In other words, the magnetic field\n\npossesses what is called a cylindrical symmetry. The\nfield that normally can depend on three coordinates\ndepends only on one: r. Whenever there is symmetry,\n\nthe solutions simplify.\n(ii) The field direction at any point on this circle is\n\ntangential to it. Thus, the lines of constant magnitude\n\nof magnetic field form concentric circles. Notice now,\n\nin Fig. 4.1(c), the iron filings form concentric circles.\nThese lines called magnetic field lines form closed\n\nloops. This is unlike the electrostatic field lines which\n\noriginate from positive charges and end at negative\n\ncharges. The expression for the magnetic field of a\nstraight wire provides a theoretical justification to\n\nOersted’s experiments.\n\n(iii) Another interesting point to note is that even though\n\nthe wire is infinite, the field due to it at a non-zero\ndistance is not infinite. It tends to blow up only when\n\nwe come very close to the wire. The field is directly\n\nproportional to the current and inversely proportional\n\nto the distance from the (infinitely long) current\nsource.\n\nA\nN\n\nD\nR\n\nE\n A\n\nM\nP\nE\n\nR\nE\n\n (\n1\n7\n7\n5\n –\n\n1\n8\n3\n6\n)\n\nAndre Ampere (1775 –\n\n1836) Andre Marie Ampere\nwas a French physicist,\nmathematician and chemist\n\nwho founded the science of\nelectrodynamics. Ampere\nwas a child prodigy\n\nwho mastered advanced\nmathematics by the age of\n12. Ampere grasped the\n\nsignificance of Oersted’s\ndiscovery. He carried out a\nlarge series of experiments\n\nto explore the relationship\nbetween current electricity\nand magnetism. These\n\ninvestigations culminated\nin 1827 with the\npublication of the\n\n‘Mathematical Theory of\nElectrodynamic Pheno-\nmena Deduced Solely from\n\nExperiments’. He hypo-\nthesised that all magnetic\nphenomena are due to\n\ncirculating electric\ncurrents. Ampere was\nhumble and absent-\n\nminded. He once forgot an\ninvitation to dine with the\nEmperor Napoleon. He died\n\nof pneumonia at the age of\n61.

This rule, called the right-hand rule*, is:\n\nGrasp the wire in your right hand with your extended thumb pointing\n\nin the direction of the current. Your fingers will curl around in the\n\ndirection of the magnetic field.\n\nAmpere’s circuital law is not new in content from Biot-Savart law.\nBoth relate the magnetic field and the current, and both express the same\nphysical consequences of a steady electrical current. Ampere’s law is to\n\nBiot-Savart law, what Gauss’s law is to Coulomb’s law. Both, Ampere’s\nand Gauss’s law relate a physical quantity on the periphery or boundary\n(magnetic or electric field) to another physical quantity, namely, the source,\n\nin the interior (current or charge). We also note that Ampere’s circuital\nlaw holds for steady currents which do not fluctuate with time. The\nfollowing example will help us understand what is meant by the term\n\nenclosed current.\n\nExample 4.8 Figure 4.15 shows a long straight wire of a circular\ncross-section (radius a) carrying steady current I. The current I is\n\nuniformly distributed across this cross-section. Calculate the\nmagnetic field in the region r < a and r > a.\n\nFIGURE 4.15\n\nSolution (a) Consider the case r > a .

The direction of the field is tangential to\n\nthe respective circular loop (1 or 2) and given by the right-hand\n\nrule described earlier in this section.\n\nThis example possesses the required symmetry so that Ampere’s\n\nlaw can be applied readily.\n\nIt should be noted that while Ampere’s circuital law holds for any\n\nloop, it may not always facilitate an evaluation of the magnetic field in\n\nevery case. For example, for the case of the circular loop discussed in\n\nSection 4.6, it cannot be applied to extract the simple expression\n\nB = µ\n0\nI/2R [Eq. (4.16)] for the field at the centre of the loop. However,\n\nthere exists a large number of situations of high symmetry where the law\n\ncan be conveniently applied. We shall use  it in the next section to calculate\n\nthe magnetic field produced by two commonly used and very useful\n\nmagnetic systems: the solenoid and the toroid.\n\n4.8  THE SOLENOID AND THE TOROID\nThe solenoid and the toroid are two pieces of equipment which generate\n\nmagnetic fields. The synchrotron uses a combination of both to generate\n\nthe high magnetic fields required. In both, solenoid and toroid, we come\n\nacross a situation of high symmetry where Ampere’s law can be\n\nconveniently  applied.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nMoving Charges and\n\nMagnetism\n\n151\n\n4.8.1  The solenoid\n\nWe shall discuss a long solenoid. By long solenoid we mean that the\nsolenoid’s length is large compared to its radius. It consists of a long\nwire wound in the form of a helix where the neighbouring turns are closely\n\nspaced. So each turn can be regarded as a circular loop.  The net magnetic\nfield is the vector sum of the fields due to all the turns. Enamelled wires\nare used for winding so that turns are insulated from each other.\n\nFigure 4.17 displays the magnetic field lines for a finite solenoid. We\nshow a section of this solenoid in an enlarged manner in Fig. 4.17(a).\nFigure 4.17(b) shows the entire finite solenoid with its magnetic field. In\nFig. 4.17(a), it is clear from the circular loops that the field  between two\nneighbouring turns vanishes. In Fig. 4.17(b), we see that the field at the\ninterior mid-point P is uniform, strong and along the axis of the solenoid.\nThe field at the exterior mid-point Q is weak and moreover is along the\naxis of the solenoid with no perpendicular or normal component. As the\nsolenoid is made longer it appears like a long cylindrical metal sheet.\nFigure 4.18 represents this idealised picture. The field outside the solenoid\napproaches zero. We shall assume that the field outside is zero. The field\ninside becomes everywhere parallel to the axis.\n\nFIGURE 4.17 (a) The magnetic field due to a section of the solenoid which has been\nstretched out for clarity. Only the exterior semi-circular part is shown. Notice\n\nhow the circular loops between neighbouring turns tend to cancel.\n(b) The magnetic field of a finite solenoid.\n\nFIGURE 4.18 The magnetic field of a very long solenoid. We consider a\nrectangular Amperian loop abcd to determine the field.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n152\n\nConsider a rectangular Amperian loop abcd. Along cd the field is zero\nas argued above. Along transverse sections bc and ad, the field component\n\nis zero. Thus, these two sections  make no contribution. Let the field along\nab be B. Thus, the relevant length of the Amperian loop is, L = h.\n\nLet n be the number of turns per unit length, then the total number\n\nof turns is  nh. The enclosed current is,  I\ne\n\n = I (n h), where I is the current\nin the solenoid. From Ampere’s circuital law [Eq. 4.17 (b)]\n\nBL =  µ\n0\nI\ne\n,    B h = µ\n\n0\nI (n h)\n\nB = µ\n0\n n I (4.20)\n\nThe direction of the field is given by the right-hand rule. The solenoid\nis commonly used to obtain a uniform magnetic field. We shall see in the\n\nnext chapter that a large field is possible by inserting a soft\n\niron core inside the solenoid.\n\n4.8.2  The toroid\n\nThe toroid is a hollow circular ring on which a large number\nof turns of a wire are closely wound.  It can be viewed as a\nsolenoid which has been bent into a circular shape to close\n\non itself. It is shown in Fig. 4.19(a) carrying a current I.   We\nshall see that the magnetic field in the open space inside\n(point P) and exterior to the toroid (point Q) is zero. The\n\nfield B inside the toroid is constant in magnitude for the\nideal toroid of closely wound turns.\n\nFigure 4.19(b) shows a sectional view of the toroid. The\n\ndirection of the magnetic field inside is clockwise as per the\nright-hand thumb rule for circular loops. Three circular\nAmperian loops 1, 2 and 3 are shown by dashed lines. By\n\nsymmetry, the magnetic field should be tangential to each\nof them and constant in magnitude for a given loop. The\ncircular areas bounded by loops 2 and 3 both cut the toroid:\n\nso that each turn of current carrying wire is cut once by\nthe loop 2 and twice by the loop 3.\n\nLet the magnetic field along loop 1 be B\n1\n in magnitude.\n\nThen in Ampere’s circuital law [Eq. 4.17(a)], L = 2π r\n1\n.\n\nHowever, the loop encloses no current, so I\ne\n = 0. Thus,\n\nB\n1\n (2 π r\n\n1\n) = µ\n\n0\n(0),    B\n\n1\n = 0\n\nThus, the magnetic field at any point P in the open space\ninside the toroid is zero.\n\nWe shall now show that magnetic field at Q is likewise\n\nzero. Let the magnetic field along loop 3 be B\n3\n. Once again\n\nfrom Ampere’s law L = 2 π r\n3\n. However, from the sectional\n\ncut, we see that the current coming out of the plane of the\n\npaper is cancelled exactly by the current going into it. Thus,\nI\ne\n= 0, and B\n\n3\n = 0. Let the magnetic field inside the solenoid\n\nbe B. We shall now consider the magnetic field at S. Once again we employ\n\nAmpere’s law in the form of Eq. [4.17 (a)]. We find, L = 2π r.\nThe current enclosed I\n\ne\n is (for N turns of toroidal coil) N I.\n\nB (2πr) = µ\n0\nNI\n\nFIGURE 4.19 (a) A toroid carrying\na current I. (b) A sectional view of\nthe toroid. The magnetic field can\n\nbe obtained at an arbitrary\ndistance r from the centre O of\nthe toroid by Ampere’s circuital\n\nlaw. The dashed lines labelled\n1, 2 and 3 are three circular\n\nAmperian loops.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nMoving Charges and\n\nMagnetism\n\n153\n\n0\n\n2\n\nNI\nB\n\nr\n\nµ\n=\n\nπ\n(4.21)\n\nWe shall now compare the two results: for a toroid and solenoid. We\n\nre-express Eq. (4.21) to make the comparison easier with the solenoid\nresult given in Eq. (4.20). Let r be the average radius of the toroid and n\nbe the number of turns per unit length. Then\n\nN = 2πr n  = (average) perimeter of the toroid\n\n                    × number of turns per unit length\n\nand thus,\n\nB = µ\n0\n n I, (4.22)\n\ni.e., the result for the solenoid!\nIn an ideal toroid the coils are circular. In reality the turns of the\n\ntoroidal coil form a helix and there is always a small magnetic field external\nto the toroid.\n\nMAGNETIC CONFINEMENT\n\nWe have seen in Section 4.3 (see also the box on helical motion of charged particles earlier\nin this chapter) that orbits of charged particles are helical. If the magnetic field is\nnon-uniform, but does not change much during one circular orbit, then the radius of the\nhelix will decrease as it enters stronger magnetic field  and the radius will increase when it\nenters weaker  magnetic fields. We consider two solenoids at a distance from each other,\nenclosed in an evacuated container (see figure below where we have not shown the container).\nCharged particles moving in the region between the two solenoids will start with a small\nradius. The radius  will increase as field decreases and the radius will decrease again as\nfield due to the second solenoid takes over.  The solenoids act as a mirror or reflector. [See\nthe direction of F as the particle approaches coil 2 in the figure. It has a horizontal component\nagainst the forward motion.] This makes the particles turn back when they approach the\nsolenoid. Such an arrangement will act like magnetic bottle or magnetic container. The\nparticles will never touch the sides of the container. Such magnetic bottles are of great use\nin confining the high energy plasma in fusion experiments. The plasma will destroy any\nother form of material container because of its high temperature. Another useful container\nis a toroid. Toroids are expected to play a key role in the tokamak, an equipment for plasma\nconfinement in fusion power reactors. There is an international collaboration called the\nInternational Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), being set up in France, for\nachieving controlled fusion, of which India is a collaborating nation.

What is the\n\nmagnitude of the magnetic field inside the solenoid?\n\nSolution  The number of turns per unit length is,\n\n500\n1000\n\n0.5\nn = =  turns/m\n\nThe length l = 0.5 m and radius r = 0.01 m. Thus, l/a = 50 i.e., l >> a .\n\nHence, we can use the long solenoid formula, namely, Eq. (4.20)\nB = µ\n\n0\nn I\n\n   = 4π × 10\n–7\n\n × 10\n3\n × 5\n\n   = 6.28 × 10\n–3\n\n T\n\n4.9 FORCE BETWEEN TWO PARALLEL CURRENTS,\nTHE AMPERE\n\nWe have learnt that there exists a magnetic field due to a conductor\n\ncarrying a current which obeys the Biot-Savart law. Further, we have\n\nlearnt that an external magnetic field will exert a force on\n\na current-carrying conductor. This follows from the\n\nLorentz force formula. Thus, it is logical to expect that\n\ntwo current-carrying conductors placed near each other\n\nwill exert (magnetic) forces on each other. In the period\n\n1820-25, Ampere studied the nature of this magnetic\n\nforce and its dependence on the magnitude of the current,\n\non the shape and size of the conductors, as well as, the\n\ndistances between the conductors. In this section, we\n\nshall take the simple example of two parallel current-\n\ncarrying conductors, which will perhaps help us to\n\nappreciate Ampere’s painstaking work.\n\nFigure 4.20 shows two long parallel conductors a\n\nand b separated by a distance d and carrying (parallel)\n\ncurrents I\na\n and I\n\nb\n, respectively. The conductor ‘a’\n\nproduces,  the same magnetic field B\na\n at all points along\n\nthe conductor ‘b’. The right-hand rule tells us that the\n\ndirection of this field is downwards (when the conductors\n\nare placed horizontally). Its magnitude is given by Eq. [4.19(a)] or from\n\nAmpere’s circuital law,\n\n0\n\n2\na\n\na\n\nI\nB\n\nd\n\nµ\n=\n\nπ\n\nThe conductor ‘b’ carrying a current I\nb\n will experience a sideways\n\nforce due to the  field B\na\n. The direction of this force is towards the\n\nconductor ‘a’ (Verify this). We label this force as F\nba\n\n, the force on a\n\nsegment L of ‘b’ due to ‘a’. The magnitude of this force is given by\n\nEq. (4.4),\n\nFIGURE 4.20 Two long straight\nparallel conductors carrying steady\n\ncurrents I\na\n and I\n\nb\n and separated by a\n\ndistance d. B\na\n is the magnetic field set\n\nup by conductor ‘a’ at conductor ‘b’.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nMoving Charges and\n\nMagnetism\n\n155\n\nF\nba\n\n = I\nb\n L B\n\na\n\n      \n0\n\n2\na bI I L\nd\n\nµ\n=\n\nπ\n(4.23)\n\nIt is of course possible to compute the force on ‘a’ due to ‘b’. From\nconsiderations similar to above we can find the force F\n\nab\n, on a segment of\n\nlength L of ‘a’ due to the current in ‘b’. It  is equal in magnitude to F\nba\n\n,\nand directed towards ‘b’. Thus,\n\nF\nba\n\n = –F\nab\n\n(4.24)\n\nNote that this is consistent with Newton’s third Law. Thus, at least for\n\nparallel conductors and steady currents, we have shown that the\n\nBiot-Savart law and the Lorentz force yield results in accordance with\n\nNewton’s third Law*.\n\nWe have seen from above that currents flowing in the same direction\n\nattract each other. One can show that oppositely directed currents repel\n\neach other. Thus,\n\nParallel currents attract, and antiparallel currents repel.\n\nThis rule is the opposite of what we find in electrostatics. Like (same\n\nsign) charges repel each other, but like (parallel) currents attract each\n\nother.\n\nLet f\nba\n\n represent the magnitude of the force F\nba\n\n per unit length. Then,\n\nfrom Eq. (4.23),\n\nπ\n\n0\n\n2\na b\n\nba\n\nI I\nf\n\nd\n\nµ\n= (4.25)\n\nThe above expression is used to define the ampere (A), which is one\n\nof the seven SI base units.\n\nThe ampere is the value of that steady current which, when maintained\n\nin each of the two very long, straight, parallel conductors of negligible\n\ncross-section, and placed one metre apart in vacuum, would produce\n\non  each of these conductors a force equal to  2 × 10\n–7\n\n newtons per metre\n\nof length.\n\nThis definition of the ampere was adopted in 1946. It is a theoretical\n\ndefinition. In practice, one must eliminate the effect of the earth’s magnetic\n\nfield and substitute very long wires by multiturn coils of appropriate\n\ngeometries. An instrument called the current balance is used to measure\n\nthis mechanical force.\n\nThe SI unit of charge, namely, the coulomb, can now be defined in\n\nterms of the ampere.\n\nWhen a steady current of 1A is set up in a conductor, the quantity of\n\ncharge that flows through its cross-section in 1s is one coulomb (1C).\n\n* It turns out that when we have time-dependent currents and/or charges in\nmotion, Newton’s third law may not hold for forces between charges and/or\n\nconductors. An essential consequence of the Newton’s third law in mechanics\n\nis conservation of momentum of an isolated system. This, however, holds even\n\nfor the case of time-dependent situations with electromagnetic fields, provided\n\nthe momentum carried by fields is also taken into account.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n156  E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 4\n\n.1\n0\n\nExample 4.10 The horizontal component of the earth’s magnetic field\n\nat a certain place is 3.0 ×10\n–5\n\n T and the direction of the field is from\nthe geographic south to the geographic north. A very long straight\nconductor is carrying a steady current of 1A. What is the force per\n\nunit length on it when it is placed on a horizontal table and the\ndirection of the current is (a) east to west; (b) south to north?\n\nSolution  F = Il × B\n\nF = IlB sinθ\nThe force per unit length is\nf = F/l = I B sinθ\n\n(a) When the current is flowing from east to west,\nθ = 90°\nHence,\n\nf = I B\n  = 1 × 3 × 10\n\n–5\n = 3 × 10\n\n–5\n N m\n\n–1\n\nROGET’S SPIRAL FOR ATTRACTION BETWEEN PARALLEL CURRENTS\n\nMagnetic effects are generally smaller than electric effects. As a consequence, the force\nbetween currents is rather small, because of the smallness of the factor µ. Hence it is\ndifficult to demonstrate attraction or repulsion between currents. Thus, for 5 A current\n\nin each wire at a separation of 1cm, the force per metre would be 5 × 10\n–4\n\n N, which is\nabout 50 mg weight. It would be like pulling a wire by a string going over a pulley to\nwhich a 50 mg weight is attached. The displacement of the wire would be quite\n\nunnoticeable.\nWith the use of a soft spring, we can increase the effective length of the parallel current\n\nand by using mercury, we can make the displacement of even a few mm observable very\n\ndramatically. You will also need a constant-current\nsupply giving a constant current of about 5 A.\n\nTake a soft spring whose natural period of\n\noscillations is about 0.5 – 1s. Hang it vertically and\nattach a pointed tip to its lower end, as shown in the\nfigure here. Take some mercury in a dish and adjust the\n\nspring such that the tip is just above the mercury\nsurface. Take the DC current source, connect one of its\nterminals to the upper end of the spring, and dip the\n\nother terminal in mercury. If the tip of the spring touches\nmercury, the circuit is completed through mercury.\n\nLet the DC source be put off to begin with. Let the tip be adjusted so that it just\n\ntouches the mercury surface. Switch on the constant current supply, and watch the\nfascinating outcome. The spring shrinks with a jerk, the tip comes out of mercury (just\nby a mm or so), the circuit is broken, the current stops, the spring relaxes and tries to\n\ncome back to its original position, the tip again touches mercury establishing a current\nin the circuit, and the cycle continues with tick, tick, tick,... In the beginning, you may\nrequire some small adjustments to get a good effect.\n\nKeep your face away from mercury vapour as it is poisonous. Do not inhale mercury\nvapour for long.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nMoving Charges and\n\nMagnetism\n\n157\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 4\n\n.1\n0\n\nThis is larger than the value 2×10\n–7\n\n Nm\n–1\n\n quoted in the definition\nof the ampere. Hence it is important to eliminate the effect of the\n\nearth’s magnetic field and other stray fields while standardising\nthe ampere.\nThe direction of the force is downwards. This direction may be\n\nobtained by the directional property of cross product of vectors.\n(b) When the current is flowing from south to north,\n\nθ = 0\no\n\nf = 0\nHence there is no force on the conductor.\n\n4.10  TORQUE ON CURRENT LOOP, MAGNETIC DIPOLE\n\n4.10.1 Torque on a rectangular current loop in a uniform\nmagnetic field\n\nWe now show that a rectangular loop carrying a steady current I and\n\nplaced in a uniform magnetic field experiences a torque. It does not\nexperience a net force. This behaviour is analogous to\n\nthat of electric dipole in a uniform electric field\n\n(Section 1.12).\n\nWe first consider the simple case when the\nrectangular loop is placed such that the uniform\n\nmagnetic field B is in the plane of the loop. This is\n\nillustrated in Fig. 4.21(a).\nThe field exerts no force on the two arms AD and BC\n\nof the loop. It is perpendicular to the arm AB of the loop\n\nand exerts a force F\n1\n on it which is directed into the\n\nplane of the loop. Its magnitude is,\n\nF\n1\n = I b B\n\nSimilarly, it exerts a force F\n2\n on the arm CD and F\n\n2\n\nis directed out of the plane of the paper.\n\nF\n2\n = I b B = F\n\n1\n\nThus, the net force on the loop is zero. There is a\n\ntorque on the loop due to the pair of forces F\n1\n and F\n\n2\n.\n\nFigure 4.21(b) shows a view of the loop from the AD\n\nend. It shows that the torque on the loop tends to rotate\nit anticlockwise. This torque is (in magnitude),\n\n1 2\n2 2\n\na a\nF Fτ = +\n\n( )\n2 2\n\na a\nIbB IbB I ab B= + =\n\n    = I A B (4.26)\n\nwhere A = ab is the area of the rectangle.\n\nWe next consider the case when the plane of the loop,\n\nis not along the magnetic field, but makes an angle with\nit. We take the angle between the field and the normal to\n\nFIGURE 4.21 (a) A rectangular\ncurrent-carrying coil in uniform\n\nmagnetic field. The magnetic moment\n\nm points downwards. The torque τττττ is\nalong the axis and tends to rotate the\n\ncoil anticlockwise.

Figure 4.22 illustrates\n\nthis general case.\nThe forces on the arms BC and DA are equal,\n\nopposite, and act along the axis of the coil, which\n\nconnects the centres of mass of BC and DA. Being\ncollinear along the axis they cancel each other,\nresulting in no net force or torque. The forces on\n\narms AB and CD are F\n1\n and F\n\n2\n. They too are equal\n\nand opposite, with magnitude,\n\nF\n1\n = F\n\n2\n = I b B\n\nBut they are not collinear!  This results in a\ncouple as before. The torque is, however, less than\nthe earlier case when plane of loop was along the\n\nmagnetic field. This is because the perpendicular\ndistance between the forces of the couple has\ndecreased. Figure 4.22(b) is a view of the\n\narrangement from the AD end and it illustrates\nthese two forces constituting a couple. The\nmagnitude of the torque on the loop is,\n\n1 2sin sin\n2 2\n\na a\nF Fτ θ θ= +\n\n= I ab B sin θ\n\n   = I A B sin θ (4.27)\n\nAs θ à 0, the perpendicular distance between\n\nthe forces of the couple also approaches zero. This\nmakes the forces collinear and the net force and\ntorque zero. The torques in Eqs. (4.26) and (4.27)\n\ncan be expressed as vector product of the magnetic moment of the coil\nand the magnetic field. We define the magnetic moment of the current\nloop as,\n\nm = I A (4.28)\n\nwhere the direction of the area vector A is given by the right-hand thumb\n\nrule and is directed into the plane of the paper in Fig. 4.21. Then as the\nangle between m and B is θ ,  Eqs. (4.26) and (4.27) can be expressed by\none expression\n\n(4.29)\n\nThis  is analogous to the electrostatic case (Electric dipole of dipole\nmoment p\n\ne\n in an electric field E).\n\nττ ××= p Ee\n\nAs is clear from Eq. (4.28), the dimensions of the magnetic moment are\n[A][L\n\n2\n] and its unit is Am\n\n2\n.\n\nFrom Eq. (4.29), we see that the torque τττττ vanishes when m is either\n\nparallel or antiparallel to the magnetic field B. This indicates a state of\nequilibrium as there is no torque on the coil (this also applies to any\nobject with a magnetic moment m).

Any small rotation of the coil produces a\ntorque which brings it back to its original position. When they are\n\nantiparallel, the equilibrium is unstable as any rotation produces a torque\nwhich increases with the amount of rotation. The presence of this torque\nis also the reason why a small magnet or any magnetic dipole aligns\n\nitself with the external magnetic field.\nIf the loop has N closely wound turns, the expression for torque, Eq.\n\n(4.29), still holds, with\n\nm = N I A (4.30)\n\nExample 4.11 A 100 turn closely wound circular coil of radius 10 cm\ncarries a current of 3.2 A. (a) What is the field at the centre of the\ncoil? (b) What is the magnetic moment of this coil?\n\nThe coil is placed in a vertical plane and is free to rotate about a\nhorizontal axis which coincides with its diameter.

In this\norientation, the magnetic field produced by the loop is in the same\n\ndirection as external field, both normal to the  plane of the loop,\nthus giving rise to maximum flux of the total field.\n\n(c) It assumes circular shape with its plane normal to the field to\n\nmaximise flux, since for a given perimeter, a circle encloses greater\n\narea than any other shape.\n\n4.10.2  Circular current loop as a magnetic dipole\n\nIn this section, we shall consider the elementary magnetic element: the\ncurrent loop. We shall show that the magnetic field (at large distances)\n\ndue to current in a circular current loop is very similar in behaviour to\nthe electric field of an electric dipole. In Section 4.6, we have evaluated\nthe magnetic field on the axis of a circular loop, of a radius R, carrying a\n\nsteady current I. The magnitude of this field is [(Eq. (4.15)],\n\n( )\n\n2\n0\n\n3/2\n2 22\n\nµ\n=\n\n+\n\nI R\nB\n\nx R\n\nand its direction is along the axis and given by the right-hand thumb\nrule (Fig. 4.12). Here, x is the distance along the axis from the centre of\n\nthe loop. For x >> R, we may drop the R\n2\n term in the denominator. Thus,\n\nIntegrating from θ = 0 to θ = π/2,\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nMoving Charges and\n\nMagnetism\n\n161\n\n2\n0\n\n3\n2\n\nIR\nB\n\nx\n\nµ\n=\n\nNote that the area of the loop A = πR\n2\n. Thus,\n\n0\n\n32\n\nIA\nB\n\nx\n\nµ\n=\n\nπ\n\nAs earlier, we define the magnetic moment m to have a magnitude IA,\n\nm  = I A.

[4.31(a)] is very similar to an expression obtained\nearlier for the electric field of a dipole. The similarity may be seen if we\nsubstitute,\n\n 0 01/µ ε→\n\ne→m p  (electrostatic dipole)\n\n →B E   (electrostatic field)\n\nWe then obtain,\n\n3\n0\n\n2\n\n4\ne\n\nxε\n=\n\nπ\n\np\nE\n\nwhich is precisely the field for an electric dipole at a point on its axis.\nconsidered in Chapter 1, Section 1.10 [Eq. (1.20)].\n\nIt can be shown that the above analogy can be carried further. We\nhad found in Chapter 1 that the electric field on the perpendicular bisector\nof the dipole is given by [See Eq.(1.21)],\n\nE ;\np\n\ne\n\nx4\n0\n\n3\nπε\n\nwhere x is the distance from the dipole. If we replace p à m and 0 01/µ ε→\n\nin the above expression, we obtain the result for B for a point in the\nplane of the loop at a distance x  from the centre. For  x >>R,\n\nB\nm\n\n;\nµ\n\n0\n\n3\n4π x\n\nx R; >> [4.31(b)]\n\nThe results given by Eqs. [4.31(a)] and [4.31(b)] become exact for a\n\npoint magnetic dipole.\nThe results obtained above can be shown to apply to any planar loop:\n\na planar current loop is equivalent to a magnetic dipole of dipole moment\n\nm = I A, which is the analogue of electric dipole moment p. Note, however,\na fundamental difference: an electric dipole is built up of two elementary\nunits — the charges (or electric monopoles). In magnetism, a magnetic\n\ndipole (or a current loop) is the most elementary element. The equivalent\nof electric charges, i.e., magnetic monopoles, are not known to exist.\n\nWe have shown that a current loop (i) produces a magnetic field (see\n\nFig. 4.12) and behaves like a magnetic dipole at large distances, and\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n162\n\n(ii) is subject to torque like a magnetic needle. This led Ampere to suggest\nthat all magnetism is due to circulating currents. This seems to be partly\n\ntrue and no magnetic monopoles have been seen so far. However,\nelementary particles such as an electron or a proton also carry an intrinsic\nmagnetic moment, not accounted by circulating currents.\n\n4.10.3  The magnetic dipole moment of a revolving electron\n\nIn Chapter 12 we shall read about the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom.\nYou may perhaps have heard of this model which was proposed by the\n\nDanish physicist Niels Bohr in 1911 and was a stepping stone\n\nto a new kind of mechanics, namely, quantum mechanics.\nIn the Bohr model, the electron (a negatively charged particle)\nrevolves around a positively charged nucleus much as a\n\nplanet revolves around the sun. The force in the former case\nis electrostatic (Coulomb force) while it is gravitational for\nthe planet-Sun case. We show this Bohr picture of the electron\n\nin Fig. 4.23.\nThe electron of charge (–e)  (e = + 1.6 ×  10\n\n–19\n C) performs\n\nuniform circular motion around a stationary heavy nucleus\n\nof charge +Ze. This constitutes a  current I, where,\n\ne\nI\n\nT\n= (4.32)\n\nand T is the time period of revolution. Let r be the orbital\n\nradius of the electron, and v the orbital speed. Then,\n\nπ2 r\nT =\n\nv\n(4.33)\n\nSubstituting in Eq. (4.32), we have I = ev/2πr.\nThere will be a magnetic moment, usually denoted by µ\n\nl\n,\n\nassociated with this circulating current. From Eq. (4.28) its\nmagnitude is, µ\n\nl\n = Iπr\n\n2\n = evr/2.\n\nThe direction of this magnetic moment is into the plane\n\nof the paper in Fig. 4.23. [This follows from the right-hand\nrule discussed earlier and the fact that the negatively charged\n\nelectron is moving anticlockwise, leading to a clockwise current.]\n\nMultiplying and dividing the right-hand side of the above expression by\nthe electron mass m\n\ne\n, we have,\n\n( )\n2\n\nl e\n\ne\n\ne\nm vr\n\nm\nµ =\n\n    \n2 e\n\ne\nl\n\nm\n= [4.34(a)]\n\nHere, l is the magnitude of the angular momentum of the electron\n\nabout the central nucleus (“orbital” angular momentum). Vectorially,\n\nµµµµµ\nl = –\n\n2\nl\n\ne\n\ne\n\nm\nl          [4.34(b)]\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the angular momentum of the electron\nis opposite in direction to the magnetic moment. Instead of electron with\n\nFIGURE 4.23 In the Bohr model\n\nof hydrogen-like atoms, the\nnegatively charged electron is\nrevolving with uniform speed\n\naround a centrally placed\npositively charged (+Z e)\n\nnucleus. The uniform circular\n\nmotion of the electron\nconstitutes a current. The\ndirection of the magnetic\n\nmoment is into the plane of the\npaper and is indicated\n\nseparately by ⊗.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nMoving Charges and\n\nMagnetism\n\n163\n\ncharge (–e), if we had taken a particle with charge (+q), the angular\nmomentum and magnetic moment would be in the same direction. The\n\nratio\n\nl\n\n2 e\n\ne\n\nl m\n\nµ\n= (4.35)\n\nis called the gyromagnetic ratio and is a constant. Its value is 8.8 × 10\n10\n\n C /kg\nfor an electron, which has been verified by experiments.\n\nThe fact that even at an atomic level there is a magnetic moment,\n\nconfirms Ampere’s bold hypothesis of atomic magnetic moments. This\naccording to Ampere, would help one to explain the magnetic properties\nof materials. Can one assign a value to this atomic dipole moment?  The\n\nanswer is Yes. One can do so within the Bohr model. Bohr hypothesised\nthat the angular momentum assumes a discrete set of values, namely,\n\n2\n\nn h\nl =\n\nπ\n(4.36)\n\nwhere n is a natural number, n = 1, 2, 3, .... and h is a constant named\n\nafter Max Planck (Planck’s constant) with a value h = 6.626 × 10–34 J s.\n\nThis condition of discreteness is called the Bohr quantisation condition.\n\nWe shall discuss it in detail in Chapter 12. Our aim here is merely to use\n\nit to calculate the elementary dipole moment. Take the value n = 1, we\n\nhave from Eq. (4.34) that,\n\nmin( )\n4\n\nl\n\ne\n\ne\nh\n\nm\nµ =\n\nπ\n\n    \n19 34\n\n31\n\n1.60 10 6.63 10\n\n4 3.14 9.11 10\n\n− −\n\n−\n\n× × ×\n=\n\n× × ×\n\n    = 9.27 × 10\n–24\n\n Am\n2\n\n(4.37)\n\nwhere the subscript ‘min’ stands for minimum. This value is called the\n\nBohr magneton.\n\nAny charge in uniform circular motion would have an associated\n\nmagnetic moment given by an expression similar to Eq. (4.34). This dipole\n\nmoment is labelled as the orbital magnetic moment. Hence, the subscript\n\n‘l’ in µ\nl\n. Besides the orbital moment, the electron has an intrinsic magnetic\n\nmoment, which has the same numerical value as given in Eq. (4.37). It is\n\ncalled the spin magnetic moment. But we hasten to add that it is not as\n\nthough the electron is spinning. The electron is an elementary particle\n\nand it does not have an axis to spin around like a top or our earth.\n\nNevertheless, it does possess this intrinsic magnetic moment. The\n\nmicroscopic roots of magnetism in iron and other materials can be traced\n\nback to this intrinsic spin magnetic moment.\n\n4.11  THE MOVING COIL GALVANOMETER\nCurrents and voltages in circuits have been discussed extensively in\n\nChapters 3. But how do we measure them? How do we claim that\ncurrent in a circuit is 1.5 A or the voltage drop across a resistor is 1.2 V?\nFigure 4.24 exhibits a very useful instrument for this purpose: the moving\n\nC\no\n\nn\nv\ne\nrs\n\nio\nn\n\n o\nf g\n\na\nlv\n\na\nn\n\no\nm\n\ne\nte\n\nr in\nto\n\n a\nm\n\nm\ne\nte\n\nr a\nn\n\nd\n v\n\no\nltm\n\ne\nte\n\nr:\n\nw\nw\n\nw\n.c\n\nity\nc\no\nlle\n\ng\nia\n\nte\n.c\n\no\nm\n\n/g\na\nlv\n\na\nn\no\nm\n\ne\nte\n\nr_\nX\nIIa\n\n.h\ntm\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n164\n\ncoil galvanometer (MCG). It is a device whose principle can be understood\non the basis of our discussion in Section 4.10.\n\nThe galvanometer consists of a coil, with many turns, free to rotate\nabout a fixed axis (Fig. 4.24), in a uniform radial magnetic field. There is\na cylindrical soft iron core which not only makes the field radial but also\n\nincreases the strength of the magnetic field.  When a current flows through\nthe coil, a torque acts on it. This torque is given by Eq. (4.26) to be\n\nτ = NI AB\n\nwhere the symbols have their usual meaning. Since the field is radial by\ndesign, we have taken sin θ = 1 in the above expression for the torque.\nThe magnetic torque NIAB tends to rotate the coil. A spring S\n\np\n provides a\n\ncounter torque kφ that balances the magnetic torque NIAB; resulting in a\nsteady angular deflection φ. In equilibrium\n\nkφ = NI AB\n\nwhere k is the torsional constant of the spring; i.e. the restoring torque\nper unit twist. The deflection φ is indicated on the scale by a pointer\nattached to the spring. We have\n\nφ =\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f7\n\nNAB\n\nk\nI (4.38)\n\nThe quantity in brackets is a constant for a given\ngalvanometer.\n\nThe galvanometer can be used in a number of ways.\n\nIt can be used as a detector to check if a current is\nflowing in the circuit. We have come across this usage\nin the Wheatstone’s bridge arrangement. In this usage\n\nthe neutral position of the pointer (when no current is\nflowing through the galvanometer) is in the middle of\nthe scale and not at the left end as shown in Fig.4.24.\n\nDepending on the direction of the current, the pointer’s\ndeflection is either to the right or the left.\n\nThe galvanometer cannot as such be used as an\nammeter to measure the value of the current in a given\n\ncircuit. This is for two reasons: (i) Galvanometer is a\n\nvery sensitive device, it gives a full-scale deflection for\n\na current of the order of µA. (ii) For measuring\ncurrents, the galvanometer has to be connected in\n\nseries, and as it has a large resistance, this will change\n\nthe value of the current in the circuit. To overcome\n\nthese difficulties, one attaches a small resistance r\ns\n,\n\ncalled shunt resistance, in parallel with\n\nthe galvanometer coil; so that most of the current\n\npasses through the shunt. The resistance of this\n\narrangement is,\n\nR\nG\n r\n\ns \n/ (R\n\nG\n  + r\n\ns\n)   ;  r\n\ns\n         if    R\n\nG\n >>  r\n\ns\n\nIf r\ns \nhas small value, in relation to the resistance of\n\nthe rest of the circuit R\nc\n, the effect of introducing the\n\nmeasuring instrument is also small and negligible. This\n\nFIGURE 4.24 The moving coil\n\ngalvanometer. Its elements are\ndescribed in the text. Depending on\nthe requirement, this device can be\n\nused as a current detector or for\nmeasuring the value of the current\n\n(ammeter) or voltage (voltmeter).\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nMoving Charges and\n\nMagnetism\n\n165\n\narrangement is schematically shown in Fig. 4.25. The scale of this\nammeter is calibrated and then graduated to read off the current value\n\nwith ease. We define the current sensitivity of the galvanometer as the\ndeflection per unit current. From Eq. (4.38) this current sensitivity is,\n\nNAB\n\nI k\n\nφ\n= (4.39)\n\nA convenient way for the manufacturer  to increase the sensitivity is\nto increase the number of turns N. We choose galvanometers having\nsensitivities of value, required by our experiment.\n\nThe galvanometer can also be used as a voltmeter to measure the\nvoltage across a given section of the circuit. For this it must be connected\nin parallel with that section of the circuit. Further, it must draw a very\n\nsmall current, otherwise the voltage measurement will disturb the original\nset up by an amount which is very large. Usually we like to keep the\ndisturbance due to the measuring device below one per cent.  To ensure\n\nthis, a large resistance R is connected in series with the galvanometer.\nThis arrangement is schematically depicted in Fig.4.26. Note that the\nresistance of the voltmeter is now,\n\nR\nG\n + R ; R :  large\n\nThe scale of the voltmeter is calibrated to read off the voltage value\nwith ease. We define the voltage sensitivity as the deflection per unit\nvoltage. From Eq.

Let us take Eq. (4.39)\n\nwhich provides a measure of current sensitivity. If N → 2N, i.e., we double\nthe number of turns, then\n\n2\nI I\n\nφ φ\n→\n\nThus, the current sensitivity doubles. However, the resistance of the\ngalvanometer is also likely to double, since it is proportional to the length\nof the wire. In Eq. (4.40), N →2N, and R →2R, thus the voltage sensitivity,\n\nV V\n\nφ φ\n→\n\nremains unchanged. So in general, the modification needed for conversion\nof a galvanometer to an ammeter  will be different from what is needed\n\nfor converting it into a voltmeter.\n\nExample 4.13 In the circuit (Fig. 4.27) the current is to be\n\nmeasured.

The total force on a charge q moving with velocity v in the presence of\nmagnetic and electric fields B and E, respectively is called the Lorentz\nforce. It is given by the expression:\nF = q (v × B + E)\nThe magnetic force q (v × B) is normal to v and work done by it is zero.\n\n2. A straight conductor of length l and carrying a steady current I\n\nexperiences a force F in a uniform external magnetic field B,\n\nF = I l × B\n\nwhere|l| = l and the direction of l is given by the direction of the\ncurrent.\n\n3. In a uniform magnetic field B, a charge q executes a circular orbit in\na plane normal to B. Its frequency of uniform circular motion is called\nthe cyclotron frequency and is given by:\n\n2\nc\n\nq B\n\nm\nν =\n\nπ\n\nThis frequency is independent of the particle’s speed and radius. This\n\nfact is exploited in a machine, the cyclotron, which is used to\naccelerate charged particles.\n\n4.

Ampere’s Circuital Law:  Let an open surface S be bounded by a loop\n\nC. Then the Ampere’s law states that B l.d I=∫ µ0\nC\n\nÑ  where I refers to\n\nthe current passing through S. The sign of I is determined from the\n\nright-hand rule. We have discussed a simplified form of this law. If B\nis directed along the tangent to every point on the perimeter L of a\n\nclosed curve and is constant in magnitude along perimeter then,\n\nBL = µ\n0\n I\n\ne\n\nwhere I\ne\n is the net current enclosed by the closed circuit.\n\n7. The magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance R from a long,\n\nstraight wire carrying a current I is given by:\n\nπ\n\n0\n\n2\n\nI\nB\n\nR\n\nµ\n=\n\nThe field lines are circles concentric with the wire.\n\n8. The magnitude of the field B inside a long solenoid carrying a current\nI is\n\nB = µ\n0\nnI\n\nwhere n is the number of turns per unit length. For a toroid one\n\nobtains,\n\n0\n\n2\n\nNI\nB\n\nr\n\nµ\n=\n\nπ\n\nwhere N is the total number of turns and r is the average radius.\n\n9. Parallel currents attract and anti-parallel currents repel.\n\n10. A planar loop carrying a current I, having N closely wound turns, and\nan area A possesses a magnetic moment m where,\n\nm = N I A\n\nand the direction of m is given by the right-hand thumb rule : curl\nthe palm of your right hand along the loop with the fingers pointing\n\nin the direction of the current. The thumb sticking out gives the\n\ndirection of m (and A)\n\nWhen this loop is placed in a uniform magnetic field B, the force F on\nit is:  F = 0\n\nAnd the torque on it is,\n\nτ = m × B\n\nIn a moving coil galvanometer, this torque is balanced by a counter-\n\ntorque due to a spring, yielding\n\nkφ = NI AB\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n168\n\nwhere φ  is the equilibrium deflection and k the torsion constant of\n\nthe spring.\n\n11. An electron moving around the central nucleus has a magnetic moment\n\nµ\nl\n given by:\n\n2\nl\n\ne\nl\n\nm\nµ =\n\nwhere l is the magnitude of the angular momentum of the circulating\n\nelectron about the central nucleus. The smallest value of µ\nl\n is called\n\nthe Bohr magneton µ\nB\n and it is  µ\n\nB\n = 9.27×10–24 J/T\n\n12. A moving coil galvanometer can be converted into a ammeter by\n\nintroducing a shunt resistance r\ns\n, of small value in parallel. It can be\n\nconverted into a voltmeter by introducing a resistance of a large value\n\nin series.\n\nPhysical Quantity Symbol Nature Dimensions Units Remarks\n\nPermeability of free µ\n0\n\nScalar [MLT\n–2\n\nA\n–2\n\n] T m A\n–1\n\n4π × 10\n–7\n\n T m A\n–1\n\nspace\n\nMagnetic Field B Vector [M T\n–2\n\nA\n–1\n\n] T (telsa)\n\nMagnetic Moment m Vector [L\n2\nA] A m\n\n2\n or J/T\n\nTorsion Constant k   Scalar [M L\n2\nT\n\n–2\n]     N m rad\n\n–1\nAppears in MCG\n\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n\n1. Electrostatic field lines originate at a positive charge and terminate at a\n\nnegative charge or fade at infinity. Magnetic field lines always form\n\nclosed loops.\n\n2. The discussion in this Chapter holds only for steady currents which do\n\nnot vary with time.\n\nWhen currents vary with time Newton’s third law is valid only if momentum\ncarried by the electromagnetic field is taken into account.\n\n3. Recall the expression for the Lorentz force,\n\nF = q (v × B + E)\n\nThis velocity dependent force has occupied the attention of some of the\n\ngreatest scientific thinkers. If one switches to a frame with instantaneous\n\nvelocity v, the magnetic part of the force vanishes. The motion of the\ncharged particle is then explained by arguing that there exists an\n\nappropriate electric field in the new frame. We shall not discuss the\n\ndetails of this mechanism. However, we stress that the resolution of this\n\nparadox implies that electricity and magnetism are linked phenomena\n\n(electromagnetism) and that the Lorentz force expression does not imply\n\na universal preferred frame of reference in nature.\n4. Ampere’s Circuital law is not independent of the Biot-Savart law. It\n\ncan be derived from the Biot-Savart law. Its relationship to the\n\nBiot-Savart law is similar to the relationship between Gauss’s law and\n\nCoulomb’s law.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nMoving Charges and\n\nMagnetism\n\n169\n\nEXERCISES\n\n4.1 A circular coil of wire consisting of 100 turns, each of radius 8.0 cm\n\ncarries a current of 0.40 A.
