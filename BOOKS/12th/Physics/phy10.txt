It explained the laws of reflection and refraction of light at an interface.\nThe corpuscular model predicted that if the ray of light (on refraction)\nbends towards the normal then the speed of light would be greater in the\nsecond medium. This corpuscular model of light was further developed\nby Isaac Newton in his famous book entitled OPTICKS and because of\nthe tremendous popularity of this book, the corpuscular model is very\noften attributed to Newton.\n\nIn 1678, the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens put forward the\nwave theory of light – it is this wave model of light that we will discuss in\nthis chapter. As we will see, the wave model could satisfactorily explain\nthe phenomena of reflection and refraction; however, it predicted that on\nrefraction if the wave bends towards the normal then the speed of light\nwould be less in the second medium. This is in contradiction to the\nprediction made by using the corpuscular model of light. It was much\nlater confirmed by experiments where it was shown that the speed of\nlight in water is less than the speed in air confirming the prediction of the\nwave model; Foucault carried out this experiment in 1850.\n\nThe wave theory was not readily accepted primarily because of\nNewton’s authority and also because light could travel through vacuum\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n352\n\nand it was felt that a wave would always require a medium to propagate\nfrom one point to the other. However, when Thomas Young performed\nhis famous interference experiment in 1801, it was firmly established\nthat light is indeed a wave phenomenon. The wavelength of visible\nlight was measured and found to be extremely small; for example, the\nwavelength of yellow light is about 0.6 µm. Because of the smallness\nof the wavelength of visible light (in comparison to the dimensions of\ntypical mirrors and lenses), light can be assumed to approximately\ntravel in straight lines. This is the field of geometrical optics, which we\nhad discussed in the previous chapter. Indeed, the branch of optics in\nwhich one completely neglects the finiteness of the wavelength is called\ngeometrical optics and a ray is defined as the path of energy\npropagation in the limit of wavelength tending to zero.\n\nAfter the interference experiment of Young in 1801, for the next 40\nyears or so, many experiments were carried out involving the\ninterference and diffraction of lightwaves; these experiments could only\nbe satisfactorily explained by assuming a wave model of light. Thus,\naround the middle of the nineteenth century, the wave theory seemed\nto be very well established. The only major difficulty was that since it\nwas thought that a wave required a medium for its propagation, how\ncould light waves propagate through vacuum. This was explained\nwhen Maxwell put forward his famous electromagnetic theory of light.\nMaxwell had developed a set of equations describing the laws of\nelectricity and magnetism and using these equations he derived what\nis known as the wave equation from which he predicted the existence\nof electromagnetic waves*. From the wave equation, Maxwell could\ncalculate the speed of electromagnetic waves in free space and he found\nthat the theoretical value was very close to the measured value of speed\nof l ight. From this, he propounded that l ight must be an\nelectromagnetic wave. Thus, according to Maxwell, light waves are\nassociated with changing electric and magnetic fields; changing electric\nfield produces a time and space varying magnetic field and a changing\nmagnetic field produces a time and space varying electric field. The\nchanging electric and magnetic fields result in the propagation of\nelectromagnetic waves (or light waves) even in vacuum.\n\nIn this chapter we will first discuss the original formulation of the\nHuygens principle and derive the laws of reflection and refraction. In\nSections 10.4 and 10.5, we will discuss the phenomenon of interference\nwhich is based on the principle of superposition. In Section 10.6 we\nwill discuss the phenomenon of diffraction which is based on Huygens-\nFresnel principle. Finally in Section 10.7 we will discuss the\nphenomenon of polarisation which is based on the fact that the light\nwaves are transverse electromagnetic waves.\n\n* Maxwell had predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves around 1855; it\nwas much later (around 1890) that Heinrich Hertz produced radiowaves in the\nlaboratory. J.C. Bose and G. Marconi made practical applications of the Hertzian\nwaves\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n353\n\nWave Optics\n\n10.2  HUYGENS PRINCIPLE\nWe would first define a wavefront: when we drop a small stone on a calm\npool of water, waves spread out from the point of impact. Every point on\nthe surface starts oscillating with time. At any instant, a photograph of\nthe surface would show circular rings on which the disturbance is\nmaximum. Clearly, all points on such a circle are oscillating in phase\nbecause they are at the same distance from the source. Such a locus of\npoints, which oscillate in phase is called a wavefront ; thus a wavefront\nis defined as a surface of constant phase. The speed with which the\nwavefront moves outwards from the source is called the speed of the\nwave. The energy of the wave travels in a direction perpendicular to the\nwavefront.\n\nIf we have a point source emitting waves uniformly in all directions,\nthen the locus of points which have the same amplitude and vibrate in\nthe same phase are spheres and we have what is known as a spherical\nwave as shown in Fig. 10.1(a). At a large distance from the source, a\n\nDOES LIGHT TRAVEL IN A STRAIGHT LINE?\n\nLight travels in a straight line in Class VI; it does not do so in Class XII and beyond! Surprised,\naren’t you?\n\nIn school, you are shown an experiment in which you take three cardboards with\npinholes in them, place a candle on one side and look from the other side. If the flame of the\ncandle and the three pinholes are in a straight line, you can see the candle. Even if one of\nthem is displaced a little, you cannot see the candle. This proves, so your teacher says,\nthat light travels in a straight line.\n\nIn the present book, there are two consecutive chapters, one on ray optics and the other\non wave optics. Ray optics is based on rectilinear propagation of light, and deals with\nmirrors, lenses, reflection, refraction, etc. Then you come to the chapter on wave optics,\nand you are told that light travels as a wave, that it can bend around objects, it can diffract\nand interfere, etc.\n\nIn optical region, light has a wavelength of about half a micrometre. If it encounters an\nobstacle of about this size, it can bend around it and can be seen on the other side. Thus a\nmicrometre size obstacle will not be able to stop a light ray. If the obstacle is much larger,\nhowever, light will not be able to bend to that extent, and will not be seen on the other side.\n\nThis is a property of a wave in general, and can be seen in sound waves too. The sound\nwave of our speech has a wavelength of about 50cm to 1 m. If it meets an obstacle of the\nsize of a few metres, it bends around it and reaches points behind the obstacle. But when it\ncomes across a larger obstacle of a few hundred metres, such as a hillock, most of it is\nreflected and is heard as an echo.\n\nThen what about the primary school experiment? What happens there is that when we\nmove any cardboard, the displacement is of the order of a few millimetres, which is much\nlarger than the wavelength of light. Hence the candle cannot be seen. If we are able to move\none of the cardboards by a micrometer or less, light will be able to diffract, and the candle\nwill still be seen.\n\nOne could add to the first sentence in this box: It learns how to bend as it grows up!\n\nFIGURE 10.1 (a) A\ndiverging spherical\n\nwave emanating from\na point source. The\n\nwavefronts are\nspherical.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n354\n\nsmall portion of the sphere can be considered as a plane and we have\nwhat is known as a plane wave [Fig. 10.1(b)].\n\nNow, if we know the shape of the wavefront at t = 0, then Huygens\nprinciple allows us to determine the shape of the wavefront at a later\ntime τ. Thus, Huygens principle is essentially a geometrical construction,\nwhich given the shape of the wafefront at any time allows us to determine\nthe shape of the wavefront at a later time. Let us consider a diverging\nwave and let F1F2 represent a portion of the spherical wavefront at t = 0\n(Fig. 10.2). Now, according to Huygens principle, each point of the\nwavefront is the source of a secondary disturbance and the wavelets\n\nemanating from these points spread out in all directions with the speed\n\nof the wave. These wavelets emanating from the wavefront are usually\n\nreferred to as secondary wavelets and if we draw a common tangent\n\nto all these spheres, we obtain the new position of the wavefront at a\n\nlater time.\n\nFIGURE 10.1 (b) At a\nlarge distance from\nthe source, a small\n\nportion of the\nspherical wave can\n\nbe approximated by a\nplane wave.\n\nFIGURE 10.2 F\n1\nF\n\n2\n represents the spherical wavefront (with O as\n\ncentre) at t = 0. The envelope of the secondary wavelets\nemanating from F\n\n1\nF\n\n2\n produces the forward moving  wavefront G\n\n1\nG\n\n2\n.\n\nThe backwave D\n1\nD\n\n2\n does not exist.\n\nThus, if we wish to determine the shape of the wavefront at t = τ, we\ndraw spheres of radius vτ from each point on the spherical wavefront\nwhere v represents the speed of the waves in the medium. If we now draw\na common tangent to all these spheres, we obtain the new position of the\nwavefront at t = τ.  The new wavefront shown as G1G2 in Fig. 10.2 is again\nspherical with point O as the centre.\n\nThe above model has one shortcoming: we also have a backwave which\nis shown as D1D2 in Fig. 10.2. Huygens argued that the amplitude of the\nsecondary wavelets is maximum in the forward direction and zero in the\nbackward direction; by making this adhoc assumption, Huygens could\nexplain the absence of the backwave. However, this adhoc assumption is\nnot satisfactory and the absence of the backwave is really justified from\nmore rigorous wave theory.\n\nIn a similar manner, we can use Huygens principle to determine the\nshape of the wavefront for a plane wave propagating through a medium\n(Fig. 10.3).\n\nFIGURE 10.3\n\nHuygens geometrical\nconstruction for a\n\nplane wave\npropagating to the\nright.

The lines A\n\n1\nA\n\n2\n,\n\nB\n1\nB\n\n2\n … etc., are\n\nnormal to both F\n1\nF\n\n2\n\nand G\n1\nG\n\n2 \nand\n\nrepresent rays.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n355\n\nWave Optics\n\n10.3 REFRACTION AND REFLECTION OF\nPLANE WAVES USING HUYGENS\nPRINCIPLE\n\n10.3.1  Refraction of a plane wave\n\nWe will now use Huygens principle to derive the laws of\nrefraction. Let PP′ represent the surface separating medium\n1 and medium 2, as shown in Fig. 10.4. Let v1 and v2\nrepresent the speed of light in medium 1 and medium 2,\nrespectively. We assume a plane wavefront AB propagating\nin the direction A′A incident on the interface at an angle i\nas shown in the figure. Let τ be the time taken by the\nwavefront to travel the distance BC. Thus,\n\nBC = v1 τ\n\nIn order to determine the shape of the refracted wavefront, we draw a\nsphere of radius v\n\n2\nτ from the point A in the second medium (the speed of\n\nthe wave in the second medium is v2). Let CE represent a tangent plane\ndrawn from the point C on to the sphere. Then, AE = v\n\n2 \nτ   and CE would\n\nrepresent the refracted wavefront.  If we now consider the triangles ABC\nand AEC, we readily obtain\n\nsin i = \n1BC\n\nAC AC\nv τ\n\n= (10.1)\n\nand\n\nsin r = \n2AE\n\nAC AC\nv τ\n\n= (10.2)\n\nwhere i and r are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n\nFIGURE 10.4 A plane wave AB is incident at an angle i\non the surface PP′  separating medium 1 and medium 2.\nThe plane wave undergoes refraction and CE represents\nthe refracted wavefront. The figure corresponds to v\n\n2\n < v\n\n1\n\nso that the refracted waves bends towards the normal.\n\nC\nH\n\nR\nIS\n\nT\nIA\n\nA\nN\n\n H\nU\n\nY\nG\n\nE\nN\n\nS\n (1\n\n6\n2\n9\n – 1\n\n6\n9\n5\n)\n\nChristiaan Huygens\n(1629 – 1695) Dutch\nphysicist, astronomer,\nmathematician and the\nfounder of the wave\ntheory of light. His book,\nTreatise on light, makes\nfascinating reading even\ntoday. He brilliantly\nexplained the double\nrefraction shown by the\nmineral calcite in this\nwork in addition to\nreflection and refraction.\nHe was the first to\nanalyse circular and\nsimple harmonic motion\nand designed and built\nimproved clocks and\ntelescopes. He discovered\nthe true geometry of\nSaturn’s rings.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n356\n\nThus we obtain\n\n1\n\n2\n\nsin\nsin\n\ni v\n\nr v\n= (10.3)\n\nFrom the above equation, we get the important result that if r < i (i.e.,\nif the ray bends toward the normal), the speed of the light wave in the\nsecond medium (v\n\n2\n) will be less then the speed of the light wave in the\n\nfirst medium (v\n1\n). This prediction is opposite to the prediction from the\n\ncorpuscular model of light and as later experiments showed, the prediction\nof the wave theory is correct. Now, if c represents the speed of light in\nvacuum, then,\n\n1\n1\n\nc\nn\n\nv\n= (10.4)\n\nand\n\nn\n2\n = \n\n2\n\nc\n\nv\n(10.5)\n\nare known as the refractive indices of medium 1 and medium 2,\nrespectively. In terms of the refractive indices, Eq. (10.3) can be\nwritten as\n\nn1 sin i = n2 sin r (10.6)\n\nThis is the Snell’s law of refraction. Further, if  λ\n1\n and λ\n\n 2\n denote the\n\nwavelengths of light in medium 1 and medium 2, respectively and if the\ndistance BC is equal to λ\n\n 1\n then the distance AE will be equal to λ\n\n 2\n (because\n\nif the crest from B has reached C in time τ, then the crest from A should\nhave also reached E in time τ ); thus,\n\n1 1\n\n2 2\n\nBC\nAE\n\nv\n\nv\n\nλ\nλ\n\n= =\n\nor\n\n1 2\n\n1 2\n\nv v\n\nλ λ\n= (10.7)\n\nThe above equation implies that when a wave gets refracted into a\ndenser medium (v1 > v2) the wavelength and the speed of propagation\ndecrease but the frequency  ν (= v/λ) remains the same.\n\n10.3.2  Refraction at a rarer medium\n\nWe now consider refraction of a plane wave at a rarer medium, i.e.,\nv2 > v1. Proceeding in an exactly similar manner we can construct a\nrefracted wavefront as shown in Fig. 10.5. The angle of refraction\nwill now be greater than angle of incidence; however, we will still have\nn\n\n1\n sin i = n\n\n2\n sin r . We define an angle i\n\nc\n by the following equation\n\n2\n\n1\n\nsin c\nn\n\ni\nn\n\n= (10.8)\n\nThus, if i = i\nc\n then sin r = 1 and r = 90°. Obviously, for i > i\n\nc\n, there can\n\nnot be any refracted wave. The angle i\nc \nis known as the critical angle and\n\nfor all angles of incidence greater than the critical angle, we will not have\n\nD\ne\nm\n\no\nn\n\ns\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n \no\n\nf \nin\n\nte\nr\nfe\n\nr\ne\nn\n\nc\ne\n, \n\nd\nif\n\nfr\na\nc\nti\n\no\nn\n\n, \nr\ne\nfr\n\na\nc\nti\n\no\nn\n\n, \nr\ne\ns\no\n\nn\na\nn\n\nc\ne\n \na\nn\n\nd\n \nD\n\no\np\n\np\nle\n\nr\n \ne\nff\n\ne\nc\nt\n\nh\ntt\np\n:/\n/w\n\nw\nw\n\n.f\na\nls\n\nta\nd\n.c\n\no\nm\n\n/r\nip\n\np\nle\n\n/\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n357\n\nWave Optics\n\nany refracted wave and the wave will undergo what is known as total\ninternal reflection. The phenomenon of total internal reflection and its\napplications was discussed in Section 9.4.\n\nFIGURE 10.5 Refraction of a plane wave incident on a rarer medium for\nwhich v\n\n2\n > v\n\n1\n. The plane wave bends away from the normal.\n\n10.3.3  Reflection of a plane wave by a plane surface\n\nWe next consider a plane wave AB incident at an angle i on a reflecting\nsurface MN. If v represents the speed of the wave in the medium and if τ\nrepresents the time taken by the wavefront to advance from the point B\nto C then the distance\n\nBC =  vτ\n\nIn order to construct the reflected wavefront we draw a sphere of radius\nvτ from the point A as shown in Fig. 10.6. Let CE represent the tangent\nplane drawn from the point C to this sphere. Obviously\n\nAE = BC = vτ\n\nFIGURE 10.6 Reflection of a plane wave AB by the reflecting surface MN.\nAB and CE represent incident and reflected wavefronts.\n\nIf we now consider the triangles EAC and BAC we will find that they\nare congruent and therefore, the angles i and r (as shown in Fig. 10.6)\nwould be equal. This is the law of reflection.\n\nOnce we have the laws of reflection and refraction, the behaviour of\nprisms, lenses, and mirrors can be understood. These phenomena were\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n358\n\ndiscussed in detail in Chapter 9 on the basis of rectilinear propagation of\nlight. Here we just describe the behaviour of the wavefronts as they\nundergo reflection or refraction. In Fig. 10.7(a) we consider a plane wave\npassing through a thin prism. Clearly, since the speed of light waves is\nless in glass, the lower portion of the incoming wavefront (which travels\nthrough the greatest thickness of glass) will get delayed resulting in a tilt\nin the emerging wavefront as shown in the figure. In Fig. 10.7(b) we\nconsider a plane wave incident on a thin convex lens; the central part of\nthe incident plane wave traverses the thickest portion of the lens and is\ndelayed the most. The emerging wavefront has a depression at the centre\nand therefore the wavefront becomes spherical and converges to the point\nF which is known as the focus. In Fig. 10.7(c) a plane wave is incident on\na concave mirror and on reflection we have a spherical wave converging\nto the focal point F. In a similar manner, we can understand refraction\nand reflection by concave lenses and convex mirrors.\n\nFIGURE 10.7 Refraction of a plane wave by (a) a thin prism, (b) a convex lens. (c) Reflection of a\nplane wave by a  concave mirror.\n\nFrom the above discussion it follows that the total time taken from a\npoint on the object to the corresponding point on the image is the same\nmeasured along any ray. For example, when a convex lens focusses light\nto form a real image, although the ray going through the centre traverses\na shorter path, but because of the slower speed in glass, the time taken\nis the same as for rays travelling near the edge of the lens.\n\n10.3.4  The doppler effect\n\nWe should mention here that one should be careful in constructing the\nwavefronts if the source (or the observer) is moving. For example, if there\nis no medium and the source moves away from the observer, then later\nwavefronts have to travel a greater distance to reach the observer and\nhence take a longer time. The time taken between the arrival of two\nsuccessive wavefronts is hence longer at the observer than it is at the\nsource. Thus, when the source moves away from the observer the\nfrequency as measured by the source will be smaller. This is known as\nthe Doppler effect. Astronomers call the increase in wavelength due to\ndoppler effect as  red shift since a wavelength in the middle of the visible\nregion of the spectrum moves towards the red end of the spectrum. When\nwaves are received from a source moving towards the observer, there is\nan apparent decrease in wavelength, this is referred to as blue shift.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n359\n\nWave Optics\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n0\n.1\n\nYou have already encountered Doppler effect for sound waves in\nChapter 15 of Class XI textbook. For velocities small compared to the\nspeed of light, we can use the same formulae which we use for sound\nwaves. The fractional change in frequency ∆ν/ν is given by –v\n\nradial\n/c, where\n\nvradial is the component of the source velocity along the line joining the\nobserver to the source relative to the observer; v\n\nradial \nis considered positive\n\nwhen the source moves away from the observer. Thus, the Doppler shift\ncan be expressed as:\n\n– radial\nv\n\nc\n\nν\nν\n\n∆\n= (10.9)\n\nThe formula given above is valid only when the speed of the source is\nsmall compared to that of light. A more accurate formula for the Doppler\neffect which is valid even when the speeds are close to that of light, requires\nthe use of Einstein’s special theory of relativity. The Doppler effect for\nlight is very important in astronomy. It is the basis for the measurements\nof the radial velocities of distant galaxies.\n\nExample 10.1 What speed should a galaxy move with respect\nto us so that the sodium line at 589.0 nm is observed\nat 589.6 nm?\n\nSolution  Since νλ = c,  –\nν λ\n\nν λ\n∆ ∆\n\n=  (for small changes in ν and λ).

You may recall that we had discussed\nthe superposition principle in Chapter 15 of your Class XI textbook.\nIndeed the entire field of interference is based on the superposition\nprinciple according to which at a particular point in the medium, the\nresultant displacement produced by a number of waves is the vector\n\nsum of the displacements produced by each of the waves.\nConsider two needles S\n\n1\n and S\n\n2\n moving periodically up and down\n\nin an identical fashion in a trough of water [Fig. 10.8(a)]. They produce\ntwo water waves, and at a particular point, the phase difference between\nthe displacements produced by each of the waves does not change\nwith time; when this happens the two sources are said to be coherent.\nFigure 10.8(b) shows the position of crests (solid circles) and troughs\n(dashed circles) at a given instant of time. Consider a point P for which\n\nS\n1\n P = S\n\n2\n P\n\nSince the distances S\n1\n P and S\n\n2\n P are equal, waves from S\n\n1\n and S\n\n2\nwill take the same time to travel to the point P and waves that emanate\nfrom S\n\n1\n and S\n\n2\n in phase will also arrive, at the point P, in phase.\n\nThus, if the displacement produced by the source S1 at the point P\nis given by\n\ny\n1\n = a cos ωt\n\nthen, the displacement produced by the source S\n2\n (at the point P) will\n\nalso be given by\n\ny2 = a cos ωt\n\nThus, the resultant of displacement at P would be given by\n\ny = y\n1\n + y\n\n2\n = 2 a cos ωt\n\nSince the intensity is proportional to the square of the amplitude,\nthe resultant intensity will be given by\n\nI = 4 I0\nwhere I\n\n0\n represents the intensity produced by each one of the individual\n\nsources; I0 is proportional to a\n2. In fact at any point on the perpendicular\n\nbisector of S1S2, the intensity will be 4I0. The two sources are said to\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFIGURE 10.8 (a) Two\nneedles oscillating in\n\nphase in water\nrepresent two coherent\n\nsources.\n(b) The pattern of\n\ndisplacement of water\nmolecules at an\n\ninstant on the surface\nof water showing nodal\n\nN (no displacement)\nand antinodal A\n\n(maximum\ndisplacement) lines.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n361\n\nWave Optics\n\ninterfere constructively and we have what is referred to as constructive\ninterference. We next consider a point Q [Fig. 10.9(a)]\nfor which\n\nS2Q –S1Q = 2λ\n\nThe waves emanating from S1 will arrive exactly two cycles earlier\nthan the waves from S\n\n2\n and will again be in phase [Fig. 10.9(a)]. Thus, if\n\nthe displacement produced by  S1  is given by\n\ny\n1\n = a cos ωt\n\nthen the displacement produced by  S\n2 \n will be given by\n\ny\n2\n = a cos (ωt – 4π)  =  a cos ωt\n\nwhere we have used the fact that a path difference of 2λ corresponds to a\nphase difference of 4π. The two displacements are once again in phase\nand the intensity will again be 4 I0 giving rise to constructive interference.\nIn the above analysis we have assumed that the distances S1Q and S2Q\nare much greater than d (which represents the distance between S\n\n1\n and\n\nS2) so that although S1Q and S2Q are not equal, the amplitudes of the\ndisplacement produced by each wave are very nearly the same.\n\nWe next consider a point R [Fig. 10.9(b)] for which\n\nS\n2\nR – S\n\n1\nR = –2.5λ\n\nThe waves emanating from S\n1 \nwill arrive exactly two and a half cycles\n\nlater than the waves from S2  [Fig. 10.10(b)]. Thus if the displacement\nproduced by  S1  is given by\n\ny1 = a cos ωt\n\nthen the displacement produced by  S2  will be given by\n\ny2 = a cos (ωt + 5π)  = – a cos ωt\n\nwhere we have used the fact that a path difference of 2.5λ corresponds to\na phase difference of 5π. The two displacements are now out of phase\nand the two displacements will cancel out to give zero intensity. This is\nreferred to as destructive interference.\n\nTo summarise: If we have two coherent sources S1 and S2 vibrating\nin phase, then for an arbitrary point P whenever the path difference,\n\nS1P  ~ S2P =  nλ     (n = 0, 1, 2, 3,...) (10.10)\n\nwe will have constructive interference and the resultant intensity will be\n4I\n\n0\n; the sign ~ between  S\n\n1\nP and S\n\n2\n P represents the difference between\n\nS\n1\nP and S\n\n2\n P. On the other hand, if the point P is such that the path\n\ndifference,\n\nS\n1\nP  ~ S\n\n2\nP = (n+\n\n1\n2\n\n) λ     (n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...) (10.11)\n\nwe will have destructive interference and the resultant intensity will be\nzero. Now, for any other arbitrary point G (Fig. 10.10) let the phase\ndifference between the two displacements be φ. Thus, if the displacement\nproduced by S1 is given by\n\ny\n1\n = a cos ωt\n\nFIGURE 10.9\n\n(a) Constructive\ninterference at a\n\npoint Q for which the\npath difference is 2λ.\n\n(b) Destructive\ninterference at a\n\npoint R for which the\npath difference is\n\n2.5 λ .\n\nFIGURE 10.10 Locus\nof points for which\n\nS\n1\nP – S\n\n2\nP is equal to\n\nzero, ±λ, ± 2λ, ± 3λ .\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n362\n\nthen, the displacement produced by S\n2\n would be\n\ny\n2\n = a cos (ωt + φ )\n\nand the resultant displacement will be given by\ny = y1 + y2\n   = a [cos ωt + cos (ωt +φ )]\n\n   = 2 a cos (φ/2) cos (ωt + φ/2)\n\nThe amplitude of the resultant displacement is 2a cos (φ/2) and\ntherefore the intensity at that point will be\n\nI = 4 I0 cos\n2 (φ/2) (10.12)\n\nIf φ = 0, ± 2 π, ± 4 π,… which corresponds to the condition given by\nEq. (10.10) we will have constructive interference leading to maximum\nintensity. On the other hand, if φ = ± π, ± 3π, ± 5π … [which corresponds to\nthe condition given by Eq. (10.11)] we will have destructive interference\nleading to zero intensity.\n\nNow if the two sources are coherent (i.e., if the two needles are going\nup and down regularly) then the phase difference φ at any point will not\nchange with time and we will have a stable interference pattern; i.e., the\npositions of maxima and minima will not change with time. However, if\nthe two needles do not maintain a constant phase difference, then the\ninterference pattern will also change with time and, if the phase difference\nchanges very rapidly with time, the positions of maxima and minima will\nalso vary rapidly with time and we will see a “time-averaged” intensity\ndistribution. When this happens, we will observe an average intensity\nthat will be given by\n\n( )204 cos /2I I φ< >= < > (10.13)\nwhere angular brackets represent time averaging. Indeed it is shown in\nSection 7.2 that if φ (t ) varies randomly with time, the time-averaged\nquantity < cos2 (φ/2) > will be 1/2. This is also intuitively obvious because\nthe function cos2 (φ/2)  will randomly vary between 0 and 1 and the\naverage value will be 1/2. The resultant intensity will be given by\n\nI = 2 I0 (10.14)\n\nat all points.\nWhen the phase difference between the two vibrating sources changes\n\nrapidly with time, we say that the two sources are incoherent and when\nthis happens the intensities just add up. This is indeed what happens\nwhen two separate light sources illuminate a wall.\n\n10.5 INTERFERENCE OF LIGHT WAVES AND YOUNG’S\nEXPERIMENT\n\nWe will now discuss interference using light waves. If we use two sodium\nlamps illuminating two pinholes (Fig. 10.11) we will not observe any\ninterference fringes. This is because of the fact that the light wave emitted\nfrom an ordinary source (like a sodium lamp) undergoes abrupt phase\n\nR\nip\n\np\nle\n\n T\na\nn\nk\n e\n\nx\np\ne\nri\n\nm\ne\nn\nts\n\n o\nn\n w\n\na\nv\ne\n i\nn\nte\n\nrf\ne\nre\n\nn\nc\ne\n\nh\ntt\np\n:/\n/p\n\nh\ne\nt.\nc\no\nlo\n\nra\nd\no\n.e\n\nd\nu\n/e\n\nn\n/s\n\nim\nu\nla\n\nti\no\nn\n/l\ne\ng\na\nc\ny\n/w\n\na\nv\ne\n-i\nn\nte\n\nrf\ne\nre\n\nn\nc\ne\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n363\n\nWave Optics\n\nchanges in times of the order of 10–10 seconds. Thus\nthe light waves coming out from two independent\nsources of light will not have any fixed phase\nrelationship and would be incoherent, when this\nhappens, as discussed in the previous section, the\nintensities on the screen will add up.\n\nThe British physicist Thomas Young used an\ningenious technique to “lock” the phases of the waves\nemanating from S\n\n1\n and S\n\n2\n. He made two pinholes S\n\n1\nand S\n\n2\n (very close to each other) on an opaque screen\n\n[Fig. 10.12(a)]. These were illuminated by another\npinholes that was in turn, lit by a bright source. Light\nwaves spread out from S and fall on both S\n\n1\n and S\n\n2\n.\n\nS1 and S2 then behave like two coherent sources\nbecause light waves coming out from S\n\n1\n and S\n\n2\n are derived from the\n\nsame original source and any abrupt phase change in S will manifest in\nexactly similar phase changes in the light coming out from S1 and S2.\nThus, the two sources S\n\n1\n and S\n\n2\n will be locked in phase; i.e., they will be\n\ncoherent like the two vibrating needle in our water wave example\n[Fig. 10.8(a)].\n\nFIGURE 10.11 If two sodium\nlamps illuminate two pinholes\n\nS\n1\n and S\n\n2\n, the intensities will add\n\nup and no interference fringes will\nbe observed on the screen.\n\nThus spherical waves emanating from S\n1\n and S\n\n2\n will produce\n\ninterference fringes on the screen GG′, as shown in Fig. 10.12(b). The\npositions of maximum and minimum intensities can be calculated by\nusing the analysis given in Section 10.4 where we had shown that for an\narbitrary point P on the line GG′ [Fig. 10.12(b)] to correspond to a\nmaximum, we must have\n\nS\n2\nP – S\n\n1\nP = nλ;    n = 0, 1, 2 ... (10.15)\n\nNow,\n\n(S\n2\nP)2 – (S\n\n1\nP)2 =  \n\n2\n2 –\n\n2\nd\n\nD x\n\uf8ee \uf8f9\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\n+ +\uf8ef \uf8fa\uf8ec \uf8f7\uf8ed \uf8f8\uf8ef \uf8fa\uf8f0 \uf8fb\n\n2\n2 –\n\n2\nd\n\nD x\n\uf8ee \uf8f9\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\n+\uf8ef \uf8fa\uf8ec \uf8f7\uf8ed \uf8f8\uf8ef \uf8fa\uf8f0 \uf8fb\n= 2x\n\n \nd\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFIGURE 10.12 Young’s arrangement to produce interference pattern.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n364\n\ninterference resulting in a dark region when \nxd\n\nD\n= (n+\n\n1\n2\n\n) λ\n\nthat is\n\nx = xn = (n+\n1\n2\n\n) ; 0, 1, 2\nD\n\nn\nd\n\nλ\n= ± ± (10.19)\n\nThus dark and bright bands appear on the screen, as shown in\nFig. 10.13. Such bands are called fringes. Equations (10.18) and (10.19)\nshow that dark and bright fringes are equally spaced and the distance\nbetween two consecutive bright and dark fringes is given by\n\nβ = x\nn+1 –xn  or  β = \n\nD\n\nd\n\nλ\n                                                           (10.20)\n\nwhich is the expression for the fringe width. Obviously, the central point\nO (in Fig. 10.12) will be bright because S\n\n1\nO = S\n\n2\nO and it will correspond\n\nto n = 0 [Eq. (10.18)]. If we consider the line perpendicular to the plane\nof the paper and passing through O [i.e., along the y-axis] then all points\non this line will be equidistant from S\n\n1\n and S\n\n2\n and we will have a bright\n\ncentral fringe which is a straight line as shown in Fig. 10.13.  In order\nto determine the shape of the interference pattern on the screen we note\nthat a particular fringe would correspond to the locus of points with a\nconstant value of S2P – S1P. Whenever this constant  is an integral\nmultiple of λ, the fringe will be bright and whenever it is an odd integral\nmultiple of λ/2 it will be a dark fringe. Now, the locus of the point P\nlying in the x-y plane such that S\n\n2\nP – S\n\n1\nP (= ∆) is a constant, is a\n\nhyperbola. Thus the fringe pattern will strictly be a hyperbola; however,\nif the distance D is very large compared to the fringe width, the fringes\nwill be very nearly straight lines as shown in Fig. 10.13.\n\nThomas Young\n(1773 – 1829)  English\nphysicist, physician and\nEgyptologist. Young worked\non a wide variety of\nscientific problems, ranging\nfrom the structure of the eye\nand the mechanism of\nvision to the decipherment\nof the Rosetta stone. He\nrevived the wave theory of\nlight and recognised that\ninterference phenomena\nprovide proof of the wave\nproperties of light.\n\nT\nH\n\nO\nM\n\nA\nS\n\n Y\nO\n\nU\nN\n\nG\n (\n1\n7\n7\n3\n –\n\n 1\n8\n2\n9\n)\n\nwhere S1S2 = d and OP = x.

For\n\nexample, for d = 0.1 cm, D = 100 cm, OP = 1 cm (which\ncorrespond to typical values for an interference\nexperiment using light waves), we have\n\nS2P + S1P  =   [(100)\n2 + (1.05)2]½ + [(100)2 + (0.95)2]½\n\n    ≈200.01 cm\nThus if we replace S\n\n2\nP + S\n\n1\nP by 2 D, the error involved is\n\nabout 0.005%.

He let a ray of sunlight into a dark room, placed a\ndark screen in front of it, pierced with two small pinholes, and\nbeyond this, at some distance, a white screen. He then saw two\ndarkish lines at both sides of a bright line, which gave him\nsufficient encouragement to repeat the experiment, this time with\nspirit flame as light source, with a little salt in it to produce the\nbright yellow sodium light. This time he saw a number of dark\nlines, regularly spaced; the first clear proof that light added to\nlight can produce darkness. This phenomenon is called\n\nFIGURE 10.13 Computer generated fringe pattern produced by two point source S\n1\n and S\n\n2\n on the\n\nscreen GG′ (Fig. 10.12); (a) and (b) correspond to d = 0.005 mm and 0.025 mm, respectively (both\nfigures correspond to D = 5 cm and λ = 5 × 10–5 cm.)

Ltd., New Delhi, 2000.)\n\n* Dennis Gabor received the 1971 Nobel Prize in Physics for discovering the\nprinciples of holography.\n\nIn the double-slit experiment shown in Fig. 10.12(b), we have taken\nthe source hole S on the perpendicular bisector of the two slits, which is\nshown as the line SO. What happens if the source S is slightly away\nfrom the perpendicular bisector. Consider that the source is moved to\nsome new point S′ and suppose that Q is the mid-point of S\n\n1\n and S\n\n2\n. If\n\nthe angle S′QS is φ, then the central bright fringe occurs at an angle –φ,\non the other side. Thus, if the source S is on the perpendicular bisector,\nthen the central fringe occurs at O, also on the perpendicular bisector. If\nS is shifted by an angle φ to point S′, then the central fringe appears at a\npoint O′ at an angle –φ, which means that it is shifted by the same angle\non the other side of the bisector. This also means that the source S′, the\nmid-point Q and the point O′ of the central fringe are in a straight line.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n366\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n0\n.3\n\ninterference.

The actual   separation of the fringes increases in\nproportion to the distance of the screen from the plane of the\ntwo slits.\n\n(b) The separation of the fringes (and also angular separation)\ndecreases. See, however, the condition mentioned in (d) below.\n\n(c) The separation of the fringes (and also angular separation)\ndecreases. See, however, the condition mentioned in (d) below.\n\n(d) Let s be the size of the source and S its distance from the plane of\nthe two slits. For interference fringes to be seen, the condition\ns/S < λ/d should be satisfied; otherwise, interference patterns\nproduced by different parts of the source overlap and no fringes\nare seen. Thus, as S decreases (i.e., the source slit is brought\ncloser), the interference pattern gets less and less sharp, and\nwhen the source is brought too close for this condition to be valid,\nthe fringes disappear. Till this happens, the fringe separation\nremains fixed.\n\n(e) Same as in (d). As the source slit width increases, fringe pattern\ngets less and less sharp. When the source slit is so wide that the\ncondition s/S ≤ λ/d is not satisfied, the interference pattern\ndisappears.\n\n(f ) The interference patterns due to different component colours of\nwhite light overlap (incoherently). The central bright fringes for\ndifferent colours are at the same position. Therefore, the central\nfringe is white. For a point P for which S2P –S1P = λb/2, where λb\n(≈ 4000 Å) represents the wavelength for the blue colour, the blue\ncomponent will be absent and the fringe will appear red in colour.\nSlightly farther away where S2Q–S1Q = λb = λr/2 where λr (≈ 8000 Å)\nis the wavelength for the red colour, the fringe will be predominantly\nblue.\n\nThus, the fringe closest on either side of the central white fringe\nis red and the farthest will appear blue. After a few fringes, no\nclear fringe pattern is seen.\n\n10.6  DIFFRACTION\nIf we look clearly at the shadow cast by an opaque object, close to the\nregion of geometrical shadow, there are alternate dark and bright regions\njust like in interference. This happens due to the phenomenon of\ndiffraction. Diffraction is a general characteristic exhibited by all types of\nwaves, be it sound waves, light waves, water waves or matter waves. Since\nthe wavelength of light is much smaller than the dimensions of most\nobstacles; we do not encounter diffraction effects of light in everyday\nobservations. However, the finite resolution of our eye or of optical\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n368\n\ninstruments such as telescopes or microscopes is limited due to the\nphenomenon of diffraction. Indeed the colours that you see when a CD is\nviewed is due to diffraction effects. We will now discuss the phenomenon\nof diffraction.\n\n10.6.1  The single slit\n\nIn the discussion of Young’s experiment, we stated that a single narrow\nslit acts as a new source from which light spreads out. Even before Young,\nearly experimenters – including Newton – had noticed that light spreads\nout from narrow holes and slits. It seems to turn around corners and\nenter regions where we would expect a shadow. These effects, known as\ndiffraction, can only be properly understood using wave ideas. After all,\nyou are hardly surprised to hear sound waves from someone talking\naround a corner!\n\nWhen the double slit in Young’s experiment is replaced by a single\nnarrow slit (illuminated by a monochromatic source), a broad pattern\nwith a central bright region is seen. On both sides, there are alternate\ndark and bright regions, the intensity becoming weaker away from the\ncentre (Fig. 10.16). To understand this, go to Fig. 10.15, which shows a\nparallel beam of light falling normally on a single slit LN of width a. The\ndiffracted light goes on to meet a screen. The midpoint of the slit is M.\n\nA straight line through M perpendicular to the slit plane meets the\nscreen at C. We want the intensity at any point P on the screen. As before,\nstraight lines joining P to the different points L,M,N, etc., can be treated as\nparallel, making an angle θ with the normal MC.\n\nThe basic idea is to divide the slit into much smaller parts, and add\ntheir contributions at P with the proper phase differences. We are treating\ndifferent parts of the wavefront at the slit as secondary sources. Because\nthe incoming wavefront is parallel to the plane of the slit, these sources\nare in phase.\n\nThe path difference NP – LP between the two edges of the slit can be\ncalculated exactly as for Young’s experiment. From Fig. 10.15,\n\nNP – LP = NQ\n\n   = a sin θ\n\n   ≈ a θ  (for smaller angles) (10.21)\n\nSimilarly, if two points M\n1\n and M\n\n2\n in the slit plane are separated by y, the\n\npath difference M2P – M1P ≈ yθ. We now have to sum up equal, coherent\ncontributions from a large number of sources, each with a different phase.\nThis calculation was made by Fresnel using integral calculus, so we omit\nit here. The main features of the diffraction pattern can be understood by\nsimple arguments.\n\nAt the central point C on the screen, the angle θ is zero. All path\ndifferences are zero and hence all the parts of the slit contribute in phase.\nThis gives maximum intensity at C. Experimental observation shown in\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n369\n\nWave Optics\n\nFig. 10.15 indicates that the intensity has a\ncentral maximum at θ = 0 and other\nsecondary maxima at θ l (n+1/2) λ/a, and\nhas minima (zero intensity) at θ l nλ/a,\nn = ±1, ±2, ±3, .... It is easy to see why it has\nminima at these values of angle. Consider\nfirst the angle θ where the path difference aθ\nis λ. Then,\n\n/aθ λ≈ . (10.22)\n\nNow, divide the slit into two equal halves\nLM and MN each of size a/2. For every point\nM\n\n1\n in LM, there is a point M\n\n2\n in MN such that\n\nM\n1\nM\n\n2\n = a/2. The path difference between M\n\n1\n and M\n\n2\n at P = M\n\n2\nP – M\n\n1\nP\n\n= θ a/2 = λ/2 for the angle chosen. This means that the contributions\nfrom M\n\n1\n and M\n\n2\n are 180° out of phase and cancel in the direction\n\nθ = λ/a. Contributions from the two halves of the slit LM and MN,\ntherefore, cancel each other. Equation (10.22) gives the angle at which\nthe intensity falls to zero. One can similarly show that the intensity is\nzero for θ = nλ/a, with n being any integer (except zero!). Notice that the\nangular size of the central maximum increases when the slit width a\ndecreases.\n\nIt is also easy to see why there are maxima at θ  = (n + 1/2) λ/a and\nwhy they go on becoming weaker and weaker with increasing n. Consider\nan angle θ = 3λ/2a which is midway between two of the dark fringes.\nDivide the slit into three equal parts. If we take the first two thirds of the\nslit, the path difference between the two ends would be\n\n2 2 3\n3 3 2\n\na\na\n\na\n\nλ\nθ λ× = × = (10.23)\n\nThe first two-thirds of the slit can therefore be divided\ninto two halves which have a λ/2 path difference. The\ncontributions of these two halves cancel in the same manner\nas described earlier. Only the remaining one-third of the\nslit contributes to the intensity at a point between the two\nminima. Clearly, this will be much weaker than the central\nmaximum (where the entire slit contributes in phase). One\ncan similarly show that there are maxima at (n + 1/2) λ/a\nwith n = 2, 3, etc. These become weaker with increasing n,\nsince only one-fifth, one-seventh, etc., of the slit contributes\nin these cases. The photograph and intensity pattern\ncorresponding to it is shown in Fig. 10.16.\n\nFIGURE 10.15  The geometry of path\ndifferences for diffraction by a single slit.\n\nThere has been prolonged discussion about difference\nbetween intereference and diffraction among scientists since\nthe discovery of these phenomena. In this context, it is\n\nFIGURE 10.16 Intensity\ndistribution and photograph of\n\nfringes due to diffraction\nat single slit.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n370\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n0\n.5\n\ninteresting to note what Richard Feynman* has said in his famous\nFeynman Lectures on Physics:\n\nNo one has ever been able to define the difference between\n\ninterference and diffraction satisfactorily. It is just a question\n\nof usage, and there is no specific, important physical difference\n\nbetween them. The best we can do is, roughly speaking, is to\n\nsay that when there are only a few sources, say two interfering\n\nsources, then the result is usually called interference, but if there\n\nis a large number of them, it seems that the word diffraction is\n\nmore often used.\n\nIn the double-slit experiment, we must note that the pattern on the\nscreen is actually a superposition of single-slit diffraction from each slit\nor hole, and the double-slit interference pattern. This is shown in\nFig. 10.17. It shows a broader diffraction peak in which there appear\nseveral fringes of smaller width due to double-slit interference. The\nnumber of interference fringes occuring in the broad diffraction peak\ndepends on the ratio d/a, that is the ratio of the distance between the\ntwo slits to the width of a slit. In the limit of a becoming very small, the\ndiffraction pattern will become very flat and we will obsrve the two-slit\ninterference pattern [see Fig. 10.13(b)].\n\n* Richand Feynman was one of the recipients of the 1965 Nobel Prize in Physics\nfor his fundamental work in quantum electrodynamics.\n\nExample 10.5 In Example 10.3, what should the width of each slit be\nto obtain 10 maxima of the double slit pattern within the central\nmaximum of the single slit pattern?\n\nSolution  We want  ,a\na\n\nλ\nθ λ θ= =\n\n10 2\nd a\n\nλ λ\n=  0 2 mm\n\n5\nd\n\na = =\n\nNotice that the wavelength of light and distance of the screen do not\nenter in the calculation of a.\n\nIn the double-slit interference experiment of Fig. 10.12, what happens\nif we close one slit? You will see that it now amounts to a single slit. But\nyou will have to take care of some shift in the pattern. We now have a\nsource at S, and only one hole (or slit) S1 or S2. This will produce a single-\n\nFIGURE 10.17 The actual double-slit interference pattern.\nThe envelope shows the single slit diffraction.\n\nIn\nte\n\nra\nc\nti\n\nv\ne\n a\n\nn\nim\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n o\n\nn\n s\n\nin\ng\nle\n\n s\nli\nt \nd\nif\nfr\n\na\nc\nti\n\no\nn\n p\n\na\ntt\n\ne\nrn\n\nh\ntt\np\n:/\n/w\n\nw\nw\n\n.p\nh\ny\ns.\n\nh\na\nw\n\na\nii\n.e\n\nd\nu\n/~\n\nte\nb\n/o\n\np\nti\nc\ns/\n\nja\nv\na\n/s\n\nli\ntd\n\nif\nfr\n/\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n371\n\nWave Optics\n\nslit diffraction pattern on the screen. The centre of the central bright fringe\nwill appear at a point which lies on the straight line SS1 or SS2, as the\ncase may be.\n\nWe now compare and contrast the interference pattern with that seen\nfor a coherently illuminated single slit (usually called the single slit\ndiffraction pattern).\n(i) The interference pattern has a number of equally spaced  bright and\n\ndark bands. The diffraction pattern has a central bright maximum\nwhich is twice as wide as the other maxima. The intensity falls as we\ngo to successive maxima away from the centre, on either side.\n\n(ii) We calculate the interference pattern by superposing two waves\noriginating from the two narrow slits. The diffraction pattern is a\nsuperposition of a continuous family of waves originating from each\npoint on a single slit.\n\n(iii) For a single slit of width a, the first null of the interference pattern\noccurs at  an angle of λ/a. At the same angle of λ/a, we get a maximum\n(not a null) for two narrow slits separated by a distance a.\nOne must understand that both d and a have to be quite small, to be\n\nable to observe good interference and diffraction patterns. For example,\nthe separation d between the two slits must be of the order of a milimetre\nor so. The width a of each slit must be even smaller, of the order of 0.1 or\n0.2 mm.\n\nIn our discussion of Young’s experiment and the single-slit diffraction,\nwe have assumed that the screen on which the fringes are formed is at a\nlarge distance. The two or more paths from the slits to the screen were\ntreated as parallel. This situation also occurs when we place a converging\nlens after the slits and place the screen at the focus. Parallel paths from\nthe slit are combined at a single point on the screen. Note that the lens\ndoes not introduce any extra path differences in a parallel beam. This\narrangement is often used since it gives more intensity than placing the\nscreen far away. If f is the focal length of the lens, then we can easily work\nout  the size of the central bright maximum. In terms of angles, the\nseparation of the central maximum from the first null of the diffraction\npattern is λ/a . Hence, the size on the screen will be f λ/a.\n\n10.6.2  Seeing the single slit diffraction pattern\n\nIt is surprisingly easy to see the single-slit diffraction pattern for oneself.\nThe equipment needed can be found in most homes –– two razor blades\nand one clear glass electric bulb preferably with a straight filament. One\nhas to hold the two blades so that the edges are parallel and have a\nnarrow slit in between. This is easily done with the thumb and forefingers\n(Fig. 10.18).\n\nKeep the slit parallel to the filament, right in front of the eye. Use\nspectacles if you normally do. With slight adjustment of the width of the\nslit and the parallelism of the edges, the pattern should be seen with its\nbright and dark bands. Since the position of all the bands (except the\ncentral one) depends on wavelength, they will show some colours. Using\na filter for red or blue will make the fringes clearer. With both filters\navailable, the wider fringes for red compared to blue can be seen.\n\nFIGURE 10.18\n\nHolding two blades to\nform a single slit. A\nbulb filament viewed\nthrough this shows\n\nclear diffraction\nbands.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n372\n\nIn this experiment, the filament plays the role of the first slit S in\nFig. 10.16. The lens of the eye focuses the pattern on the screen (the\nretina of the eye).\n\nWith some effort, one can cut a double slit in an aluminium foil with\na blade. The bulb filament can be viewed as before to repeat Young’s\nexperiment. In daytime, there is another suitable bright source subtending\na small angle at the eye. This is the reflection of the Sun in any shiny\nconvex surface (e.g., a cycle bell). Do not try direct sunlight – it can damage\nthe eye and will not give fringes anyway as the Sun subtends an angle\nof (1/2)°.\n\nIn interference and diffraction, light energy is redistributed. If it\n\nreduces in one region, producing a dark fringe, it increases in another\n\nregion, producing a bright fringe. There is no gain or loss of energy,\n\nwhich is consistent with the principle of conservation of energy.\n\n10.6.3  Resolving power of optical instruments\n\nIn Chapter 9 we had discussed about telescopes. The angular resolution\nof the telescope is determined by the objective of the telescope. The stars\nwhich are not resolved in the image produced by the objective cannot be\nresolved by any further magnification produced by the eyepiece. The\nprimary purpose of the eyepiece is to provide magnification of the image\nproduced by the objective.\n\nConsider a parallel beam of light falling on a convex lens. If the lens is\nwell corrected for aberrations, then geometrical optics tells us that the\nbeam will get focused to a point. However, because of diffraction, the\nbeam instead of getting focused to a point gets focused to a spot of finite\narea. In this case the effects due to diffraction can be taken into account\nby considering a plane wave incident on a circular aperture followed by\na convex lens (Fig. 10.19). The analysis of the corresponding diffraction\npattern is quite involved; however, in principle, it is similar to the analysis\ncarried out to obtain the single-slit diffraction pattern. Taking into account\nthe effects due to diffraction, the pattern on the focal plane would consist\nof a central bright region surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings\n(Fig. 10.19). A detailed analysis shows that the radius of the central bright\nregion is approximately given by\n\n0\n\n1.22 0.61\n2\n\nf f\nr\n\na a\n\nλ λ\n≈ = (10.24)\n\nFIGURE 10.19 A parallel beam of light is incident on a convex lens.\nBecause of diffraction effects, the beam gets focused to a\n\nspot of radius ≈ 0.61 λf/a .\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n373\n\nWave Optics\n\nwhere f  is the focal length of the lens and 2a is the diameter of the circular\naperture or the diameter of the lens, whichever is smaller. Typically if\n\nλ ≈  0.5 µm,  f ≈  20 cm  and  a ≈  5 cm\nwe have\n\nr\n0\n  ≈  1.2 µm\n\nAlthough the size of the spot is very small, it plays an important role\nin determining the limit of resolution of optical instruments like a telescope\nor a microscope.

This\nimplies that the telescope will have better resolving power if a is large. It\nis for this reason that for better resolution, a telescope must have a large\ndiameter objective.\n\nExample 10.6 Assume that light of wavelength 6000Å is coming from\na star. What is the limit of resolution of a telescope whose objective\nhas a diameter of 100 inch?\n\nSolution A 100 inch telescope implies that 2a = 100 inch\n= 254 cm. Thus if,\n\nλ ≈ 6000Å = 6×10–5 cm\nthen\n\n–5\n–70.61 6 10 2.9 10\n\n127\nθ\n\n× ×\n∆ ≈ ≈ × radians\n\nWe can apply a similar argument to the objective lens of a microscope.\nIn this case, the object is placed slightly beyond f, so that a real image is\nformed at a distance v [Fig. 10.20]. The magnification (ratio of\nimage size to object size) is given by m l v/f. It can be seen from\nFig. 10.20 that\n\nD/f l 2 tan β (10.26)\nwhere 2β is the angle subtended by the diameter of the objective lens at\nthe focus of the microscope.\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n0\n.6\n\nFIGURE 10.20 Real image formed by the objective lens of the microscope.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n374\n\nWhen the separation between two points in a microscopic specimen\nis comparable to the wavelength λ of the light, the diffraction effects\nbecome important.

Make\nblack stripes of equal width separated by white stripes; see figure here. All the black\nstripes should be of equal width, while the width of the intermediate white stripes should\nincrease as you go from the left to the right. For example, let all black stripes have a width\nof 5 mm. Let the width of the first two white stripes be 0.5 mm each, the next two white\nstripes be 1 mm each, the next two 1.5 mm each, etc. Paste this pattern on a wall in a\nroom or laboratory, at the height of your eye.\n\nNow watch the pattern, preferably with one eye. By moving away or closer to the wall,\nfind the position where you can just see some two black stripes as separate stripes. All\nthe black stripes to the left of this stripe would merge into one another and would not be\ndistinguishable. On the other hand, the black stripes to the right of this would be more\nand more clearly visible. Note the width d of the white stripe which separates the two\nregions, and measure the distance D of the wall from your eye. Then d/D is the resolution\nof your eye.\n\nYou have watched specks of dust floating in air in a sunbeam entering through your\nwindow. Find the distance (of a speck) which you can clearly see and distinguish from a\nneighbouring speck. Knowing the resolution of your eye and the distance of the speck,\nestimate the size of the speck of dust.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n375\n\nWave Optics\n\n1.22\n2sin\n\nλ\nβ\n\n� (10.29)\n\nIf the medium between the object and the objective lens is not air but\na medium of refractive index n, Eq. (10.29)  gets  modified to\n\nmin\n\n1.22\n2 sin\n\nd\nn\n\nλ\nβ\n\n= (10.30)\n\nThe product n sinβ is called the numerical aperture and is sometimes\nmarked on the objective.\n\nThe resolving power of the microscope is given by the reciprocal of\nthe minimum separation of two points seen as distinct. It can be seen\nfrom Eq. (10.30) that the resolving power can be increased by choosing a\nmedium of higher refractive index. Usually an oil having a refractive index\nclose to that of the objective glass is used. Such an arrangement is called\nan ‘oil immersion objective’. Notice that it is not possible to make sinβ\nlarger than unity. Thus, we see that the resolving power of a microscope\nis basically determined by the wavelength of the light used.\n\nThere is a likelihood of confusion between resolution and\nmagnification, and similarly between the role of a telescope and a\nmicroscope to deal with these parameters. A telescope produces images\nof far objects nearer to our eye. Therefore objects which are not resolved\nat far distance, can be resolved by looking at them through a telescope.\nA microscope, on the other hand, magnifies objects (which are near to\nus) and produces their larger image. We may be looking at two stars or\ntwo satellites of a far-away planet, or we may be looking at different\nregions of a living cell. In this context, it is good to remember that a\ntelescope resolves whereas a microscope magnifies.\n\n10.6.4  The validity of ray optics\n\nAn aperture (i.e., slit or hole) of size a illuminated by a parallel beam\nsends diffracted light into an angle of approximately ≈ λ/a . This is the\nangular size of the bright central maximum. In travelling a distance z,\nthe diffracted beam therefore acquires a width zλ/a due to diffraction. It\nis interesting to ask at what value of z the spreading due to diffraction\nbecomes comparable to the size a of the aperture. We thus approximately\nequate zλ/a with a. This gives the distance beyond which divergence of\nthe beam of width a becomes significant. Therefore,\n\n2\na\n\nz\nλ\n\n� (10.31)\n\nWe define a quantity z\nF\n\n  called the Fresnel distance by the following\nequation\n\n2 /Fz a λ�\nEquation (10.31) shows that for distances much smaller than z\n\nF\n , the\n\nspreading due to diffraction is smaller compared to the size of the beam.\nIt becomes comparable when the distance is approximately  z\n\nF\n. For\n\ndistances much greater than z\nF\n, the spreading due to diffraction\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n376\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n0\n.7\n\ndominates over that due to ray optics (i.e., the size a of the aperture).\nEquation (10.31) also shows that ray optics is valid in the limit of\nwavelength tending to zero.\n\nExample 10.7 For what distance is ray optics a good approximation\nwhen the aperture is 3 mm wide and the wavelength is 500 nm?\n\nSolution  \n( )2–32\n\n–7\n\n3 10\n18 m\n\n5 10\nF\n\na\nz\n\nλ\n\n×\n= = =\n\n×\n\nThis example shows that even with a small aperture, diffraction\nspreading can be neglected for rays many metres in length. Thus, ray\noptics is valid in many common situations.\n\n10.7  POLARISATION\nConsider holding a long string that is held horizontally, the other end of\nwhich is assumed to be fixed. If we move the end of the string up and\ndown in a periodic manner, we will generate a wave propagating  in the\n+x direction (Fig. 10.21). Such a wave could be described by the following\nequation\n\nFIGURE 10.21 (a) The curves represent the displacement of a string at\nt = 0 and at t = ∆t, respectively when a sinusoidal wave is propagating\n\nin the +x-direction. (b) The curve represents the time variation\nof the displacement at x = 0 when a sinusoidal wave is propagating\n\nin the +x-direction. At  x = ∆x, the time variation of the\ndisplacement will be slightly displaced to the right.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n377\n\nWave Optics\n\ny (x,t ) = a sin (kx – ωt) (10.32)\n\nwhere a and ω (= 2πν ) represent the amplitude and the angular frequency\nof the wave, respectively; further,\n\n2\nk\n\nλ\nπ\n\n= (10.33)\n\nrepresents the wavelength associated with the wave. We had discussed\npropagation of such waves in Chapter 15 of Class XI textbook. Since the\ndisplacement (which is along the y direction) is at right angles to the\ndirection of propagation of the wave, we have what is known as a\ntransverse wave. Also, since the displacement is in the y direction, it is\noften referred to as a y-polarised wave. Since each point on the string\nmoves on a straight line, the wave is also referred to as a linearly polarised\nwave. Further, the string always remains confined to the x-y plane and\ntherefore it is also referred to as a plane polarised wave.\n\nIn a similar manner we can consider the vibration of the string in the\nx-z plane generating a z-polarised wave whose displacement will be given\nby\n\nz (x,t ) = a sin (kx – ωt ) (10.34)\n\nIt should be mentioned that the linearly polarised waves [described\nby Eqs. (10.32) and (10.34)] are all transverse waves; i.e., the\ndisplacement of each point of the string is always at right angles to the\ndirection of propagation of the wave. Finally, if the plane of vibration of\nthe string is changed randomly in very short intervals of time, then we\nhave what is known as an unpolarised wave. Thus, for an unpolarised\nwave the displacement will be randomly changing with time though it\nwill always be perpendicular to the direction of propagation.\n\nLight waves are transverse in nature; i.e., the electric field associated\nwith a propagating light wave is always at right angles to the direction of\npropagation of the wave. This can be easily demonstrated using a simple\npolaroid. You must have seen thin plastic like sheets, which are called\npolaroids. A polaroid consists of long chain molecules aligned in a\nparticular direction. The electric vectors (associated with the propagating\nlight wave) along the direction of the aligned molecules get absorbed.\nThus, if an unpolarised light wave is incident on such a polaroid then\nthe light wave will get linearly polarised with the electric vector oscillating\nalong a direction perpendicular to the aligned molecules; this direction\nis known as the pass-axis of the polaroid.\n\nThus, if the light from an ordinary source (like a sodium lamp) passes\nthrough a polaroid sheet P1, it is observed that its intensity is reduced by\nhalf. Rotating P\n\n1\n has no effect on the transmitted beam and transmitted\n\nintensity remains constant. Now, let an identical piece of polaroid P\n2\n be\n\nplaced before P1. As expected, the light from the lamp is reduced in\nintensity on passing through P\n\n2\n alone. But now rotating P\n\n1\n has a dramatic\n\neffect on the light coming from P\n2\n. In one position, the intensity transmitted\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n378  E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n0\n.8\n\nby P\n2\n followed by P\n\n1\n is nearly zero. When turned by 90° from this position,\n\nP\n1\n transmits nearly the full intensity emerging from P\n\n2\n (Fig. 10.22).\n\nThe above experiment can be easily understood by assuming that\nlight passing through the polaroid P2 gets polarised along  the pass-axis\nof  P\n\n2\n. If the pass-axis of  P\n\n2 \nmakes an angle θ with the pass-axis of  P\n\n1\n,\n\nthen  when the polarised beam passes through the polaroid P\n2\n, the\n\ncomponent  E cos θ  (along the pass-axis of P2) will pass through P2.\nThus, as we rotate the polaroid P\n\n1 \n(or P\n\n2\n), the intensity will vary as:\n\nI = I0 cos\n2θ (10.35)\n\nwhere I0 is the intensity of the polarized light after passing through\nP\n\n1\n.\n \nThis is known as Malus’ law. The above discussion shows that the\n\nintensity coming out of a single polaroid is half of the incident intensity.\nBy putting a second polaroid, the intensity can be further controlled\nfrom 50% to zero of the incident intensity by adjusting the angle between\nthe pass-axes of two polaroids.\n\nPolaroids can be used to control the intensity, in sunglasses,\nwindowpanes, etc. Polaroids are also used in photographic cameras and\n3D movie cameras.\n\nExample 10.8 Discuss the intensity of transmitted light when a\npolaroid sheet is rotated between two crossed polaroids?\n\nSolution Let I0 be the intensity of polarised light after passing through\nthe first polariser P1. Then the intensity of light after passing through\nsecond polariser P2 will be\n\n2\n0cosI I θ= ,\n\nFIGURE 10.22 (a) Passage of light through two polaroids P\n2\n and P\n\n1\n. The\n\ntransmitted fraction falls from 1 to 0 as the angle between them varies\nfrom  0° to 90°. Notice that the light seen through a single polaroid\n\nP\n1 does not vary with angle. (b) Behaviour of the electric vector\nwhen light passes through two polaroids. The transmitted\npolarisation is the component parallel to the polaroid axis.\n\nThe double arrows show the oscillations of the electric vector.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n379\n\nWave Optics\n\nwhere θ is the angle between pass axes of P1 and P2. Since P1 and P3\nare crossed the angle between the pass axes of P2 and P3 will be\n(π/2–θ ). Hence the intensity of light emerging from P3 will be\n\n2 2\n0cos cos –2\n\nI I θ θ\nπ\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\n= \uf8ec \uf8f7\uf8ed \uf8f8\n\n  = I0 cos\n2θ  sin2θ =(I0/4) sin\n\n22θ\n\nTherefore, the transmitted intensity will be maximum when θ = π/4.\n\n10.7.1  Polarisation by scattering\n\nThe light from a clear blue portion of the sky shows a rise and fall of\nintensity when viewed through a polaroid which is rotated. This is nothing\nbut sunlight, which has changed its direction (having been scattered) on\nencountering the molecules of the earth’s atmosphere. As Fig. 10.23(a)\nshows, the incident sunlight is unpolarised. The dots stand for polarisation\nperpendicular to the plane of the figure. The double arrows show\npolarisation in the plane of the figure. (There is no phase relation between\nthese two in unpolarised light). Under the influence of the electric field of\nthe incident wave the electrons in the molecules acquire components of\nmotion in both these directions. We have drawn an observer looking at\n90° to the direction of the sun. Clearly, charges accelerating parallel to\nthe double arrows do not radiate energy towards this observer since their\nacceleration has no transverse component. The radiation scattered by\nthe molecule is therefore represented by dots. It is polarised\nperpendicular to the plane of the figure. This explains the polarisation of\nscattered light from the sky.\n\nFIGURE 10.23 (a) Polarisation of the blue scattered light from the sky.\nThe incident sunlight is unpolarised (dots and arrows).

Consider a related question: Is it possible\nthat under some conditions a monochromatic beam of light incident on a surface\n\n(which is normally reflective) gets completely transmitted with no reflection? To your\nsurprise, the answer is yes.\n\nLet us try a simple experiment and check what happens. Arrange a laser, a good\npolariser, a prism and screen as shown in the figure here.\n\nLet the light emitted by the laser source pass through the polariser and be incident\non the surface of the prism at the Brewster’s  angle of incidence i\n\nB\n. Now rotate the\n\npolariser carefully and you will observe that for a specific alignment of the polariser, the\nlight incident on the prism is completely transmitted and no light is reflected from the\nsurface of the prism. The reflected spot will completely vanish.\n\n10.7.2  Polarisation by reflection\n\nFigure 10.23(b) shows light reflected from a transparent medium, say,\nwater. As before, the dots and arrows indicate that both polarisations are\npresent in the incident and refracted waves. We have drawn a situation\nin which the reflected wave travels at right angles to the refracted wave.\nThe oscillating electrons in the water produce the reflected wave. These\nmove in the two directions transverse to the radiation from wave in the\nmedium, i.e., the refracted wave. The arrows are parallel to the direction\nof the reflected wave. Motion in this direction does not contribute to the\nreflected wave. As the figure shows, the reflected light is therefore linearly\npolarised perpendicular to the plane of the figure (represented by dots).\nThis can be checked by looking at the reflected light through an analyser.\nThe transmitted intensity will be zero when the axis of the analyser is in\nthe plane of the figure, i.e., the plane of incidence.\n\nWhen unpolarised light is incident on the boundary between two\ntransparent media, the reflected light is polarised with its electric vector\nperpendicular to the plane of incidence when the  refracted and reflected\nrays make a right angle with each other. Thus we have seen that when\nreflected wave is perpendicular to the refracted wave, the reflected wave\nis a totally polarised wave. The angle of incidence in this case is called\nBrewster’s angle and is denoted by iB. We can see that iB is related to the\nrefractive index of the denser medium. Since we have iB+r = π/2, we get\nfrom Snell’s law\n\n( )\nsin sin\nsin sin /2 –\n\nB B\n\nB\n\ni i\n\nr i\nµ = =\n\nπ\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n381\n\nWave Optics\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n0\n.9\n\nsin\ntan\n\ncos\nB\n\nB\n\nB\n\ni\ni\n\ni\n= = (10.36)\n\nThis is known as Brewster’s law.\n\nExample 10.9 Unpolarised light is incident on a plane glass surface.\nWhat should be the angle of incidence so that the reflected and\nrefracted rays are perpendicular to each other?\n\nSolution For i + r to be equal to π/2, we should have tan i\nB\n = µ = 1.5.\n\nThis gives iB = 57°. This is the Brewster’s angle for air to glass\ninterface.\n\nFor simplicity, we have discussed scattering of light by 90°, and\nreflection at the Brewster angle. In this special situation, one of the two\nperpendicular components of the electric field is zero. At other angles,\nboth components are present but one is stronger than the other. There is\nno stable phase relationship between the two perpendicular components\nsince these are derived from two perpendicular components of an\nunpolarised beam. When such light is viewed through a rotating analyser,\none sees a maximum and a minimum of intensity but not complete\ndarkness. This kind of light is called partially polarised.\n\nLet us try to understand the situation. When an unpolarised beam of\nlight is incident at the Brewster’s angle on an interface of two media, only\npart of light with electric field vector perpendicular to the plane of\nincidence will be reflected. Now by using a good polariser, if we completely\nremove all the light with its electric vector perpendicular to the plane of\nincidence and let this light be incident on the surface of the prism at\nBrewster’s angle, you will then observe no reflection and there will be\ntotal transmission of light.\n\nWe began this chapter by pointing out that there are some phenomena\nwhich can be explained only by the wave theory. In order to develop a\nproper understanding, we first described how some phenomena like\nreflection and refraction, which were studied on this basis of Ray Optics\nin Chapter 9, can also be understood on the basis of Wave Optics. Then\nwe described Young’s double slit experiment which was a turning point\nin the study of optics. Finally, we described some associated points such\nas diffraction, resolution, polarisation, and validity of ray optics. In the\nnext chapter, you will see how new experiments led to new theories at\nthe turn of the century around 1900 A.D.\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. Huygens’ principle tells us that each point on a wavefront is a source\nof secondary waves, which add up to give the wavefront at a later time.\n\n2. Huygens’ construction tells us that the new wavefront is the forward\nenvelope of the secondary waves. When the speed of light is\nindependent of direction, the secondary waves are spherical. The rays\nare then perpendicular to both the wavefronts and the time of travel\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n382\n\nis the same measured along any ray. This principle leads to the well\nknown laws of reflection and refraction.\n\n3. The principle of superposition of waves applies whenever two or more\nsources of light illuminate the same point. When we consider the\nintensity of light due to these sources at the given point, there is an\ninterference term in addition to the sum of the individual intensities.\nBut this term is important only if it has a non-zero average, which\noccurs only if the sources have the same frequency and a stable\nphase difference.\n\n4. Young’s double slit of separation d gives equally spaced fringes of\nangular separation λ/d. The source, mid-point of the slits, and central\nbright fringe lie in a straight line. An extended source will destroy\nthe fringes if it subtends angle more than λ/d at the slits.\n\n5. A single slit of width a gives a diffraction pattern with a central\n\nmaximum. The intensity falls to zero at angles of \n2\n\n, ,\na a\n\nλ λ\n± ±  etc.,\n\nwith successively weaker secondary maxima in between. Diffraction\nlimits the angular resolution of a telescope to λ/D where D is the\ndiameter. Two stars closer than this give strongly overlapping images.\nSimilarly, a microscope objective subtending angle 2β  at the focus,\nin a medium of refractive index n, will just separate two objects spaced\nat a distance λ/(2n sin β), which is the resolution limit of a\nmicroscope. Diffraction determines the limitations of the concept of\nlight rays. A beam of width a travels a distance a2/λ, called the Fresnel\ndistance, before it starts to spread out due to diffraction.\n\n6. Natural light, e.g., from the sun is unpolarised. This means the electric\nvector takes all possible directions in the transverse plane, rapidly\nand randomly, during a measurement. A polaroid transmits only one\ncomponent (parallel to a special axis). The resulting light is called\nlinearly polarised or plane polarised. When this kind of light is viewed\nthrough a second polaroid  whose axis turns through 2π, two maxima\nand minima of intensity are seen. Polarised light can also be produced\nby reflection at a special angle (called the Brewster angle) and by\nscattering through π/2 in the earth’s atmosphere.\n\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n\n1. Waves from a point source spread out in all directions, while light was\nseen to travel along  narrow  rays. It required the insight and experiment\nof Huygens, Young and Fresnel to understand how a wave theory could\nexplain all aspects of the behaviour of light.\n\n2. The crucial new feature of waves is interference of amplitudes from different\nsources which can be both constructive and destructive, as shown in\nYoung’s experiment.\n\n3. Diffraction phenomena define the limits of ray optics. The limit of the\nability of microscopes and telescopes to distinguish very close objects is\nset by the wavelength of light.\n\n4. Most interference and diffraction effects exist even for longitudinal waves\nlike sound in air. But polarisation phenomena are special to transverse\nwaves like light waves.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n383\n\nWave Optics\n\nEXERCISES\n\n10.1 Monochromatic light of wavelength 589 nm is incident from air on a\nwater surface.
