When an external force does work in taking a body from a\npoint to another against a force like spring force or gravitational force,\nthat work gets stored as potential energy of the body. When the external\nforce is removed, the body moves, gaining kinetic energy and losing\nan equal amount of potential energy. The sum of kinetic and\npotential energies is thus conserved. Forces of this kind are called\nconservative forces. Spring force and gravitational force are examples of\nconservative forces.\n\nCoulomb force between two (stationary) charges is also a conservative\nforce. This is not surprising, since both have inverse-square dependence\non distance and differ mainly in the proportionality constants – the\nmasses in the gravitational law are replaced by charges in Coulomb’s\nlaw. Thus, like the potential energy of a mass in a gravitational\nfield, we can define electrostatic potential energy of a charge in an\nelectrostatic field.\n\nConsider an electrostatic field E due to some charge configuration.\nFirst, for simplicity, consider the field E due to a charge Q placed at the\norigin. Now, imagine that we bring a test charge q from a point R to a\npoint P against the repulsive force on it due to the charge Q. With reference\n\nChapter Two\n\nELECTROSTATIC\n\nPOTENTIAL AND\n\nCAPACITANCE\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n52\n\nto Fig. 2.1, this will happen if Q and q are both positive\nor both negative. For definiteness, let us take Q, q > 0.\n\nTwo remarks may be made here. First, we assume\nthat the test charge q is so small that it does not disturb\nthe original configuration, namely the charge Q at the\norigin (or else, we keep Q fixed at the origin by some\nunspecified force). Second, in bringing the charge q from\nR to P, we apply an external force F\n\next\n just enough to\n\ncounter the repulsive electric force FE (i.e, Fext= –FE).\nThis means there is no net force on or acceleration of\nthe charge q when it is brought from R to P, i.e., it is\nbrought with infinitesimally slow constant speed. In\n\nthis situation, work done by the external force is the negative of the work\ndone by the electric force, and gets fully stored in the form of potential\nenergy of the charge q. If the external force is removed on reaching P, the\nelectric force will take the charge away from Q – the stored energy (potential\nenergy) at P is used to provide kinetic energy to the charge q in such a\nway that the sum of the kinetic and potential energies is conserved.\n\nThus, work done by external forces in moving a charge q from R to P is\n\nW\nRP\n\n =   F rext id\nR\n\nP\n\n∫\n\n        =    −∫ F rE\nR\n\nP\n\ndi  (2.1)\n\nThis work done is against electrostatic repulsive force and gets stored\nas potential energy.\n\nAt every point in electric field, a particle with charge q possesses a\ncertain electrostatic potential energy, this work done increases its potential\nenergy by an amount equal to potential energy difference between points\nR and P.\n\nThus, potential energy difference\n\nP R RPU U U W∆ = − = (2.2)\n(Note here that this displacement is in an opposite sense to the electric\n\nforce and hence work done by electric field is negative, i.e., –W\nRP\n\n.)\nTherefore, we can define electric potential energy difference between\n\ntwo points as the work required to be done by an external force in moving\n(without accelerating) charge q from one point to another for electric field\nof any arbitrary charge configuration.\n\nTwo important comments may be made at this stage:\n(i) The right side of Eq. (2.2) depends only on the initial and final positions\n\nof the charge. It means that the work done by an electrostatic field in\nmoving a charge from one point to another depends only on the initial\nand the final points and is independent of the path taken to go from\none point to the other. This is the fundamental characteristic of a\nconservative force. The concept of the potential energy would not be\nmeaningful if the work depended on the path. The path-independence\nof work done by an electrostatic field can be proved using the\nCoulomb’s law. We omit this proof here.\n\nFIGURE 2.1 A test charge q (> 0) is\nmoved from the point R to the\npoint P against the repulsive\n\nforce on it by the charge Q (> 0)\nplaced at the origin.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectrostatic Potential\n\nand Capacitance\n\n53\n\n(ii) Equation (2.2) defines potential energy difference in terms\nof the physically meaningful quantity work. Clearly,\npotential energy so defined is undetermined to within an\nadditive constant.What this means is that the actual value\nof potential energy is not physically significant; it is only\nthe difference of potential energy that is significant. We can\nalways add an arbitrary constant α to potential energy at\nevery point, since this will not change the potential energy\ndifference:\n\n( ) ( )P R P RU U U Uα α+ − + = −\n\nPut it differently, there is a freedom in choosing the point\nwhere potential energy is zero. A convenient choice is to have\nelectrostatic potential energy zero at infinity. With this choice,\nif we take the point R at infinity, we get from Eq. (2.2)\n\nP P PW U U U∞ ∞= − = (2.3)\n\nSince the point P is arbitrary, Eq. (2.3) provides us with a\ndefinition of potential energy of a charge q at any point.\nPotential energy of charge q at a point (in the presence of field\ndue to any charge configuration) is the work done by the\nexternal force (equal and opposite to the electric force) in\nbringing the charge q from infinity to that point.\n\n2.2  ELECTROSTATIC POTENTIAL\nConsider any general static charge configuration. We define\npotential energy of a test charge q in terms of the work done\non the charge q. This work is obviously proportional to q, since\nthe force at any point is qE, where E is the electric field at that\npoint due to the given charge configuration. It is, therefore,\nconvenient to divide the work by the amount of charge q, so\nthat the resulting quantity is independent of q. In other words,\nwork done per unit test charge is characteristic of the electric\nfield associated with the charge configuration. This leads to\nthe idea of electrostatic potential V due to a given charge\nconfiguration. From Eq. (2.1), we get:\n\nWork done by external force in bringing a unit positive\ncharge from point R to P\n\n= V\nP \n– V\n\nR\n  =\n\n−\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\nU U\n\nq\nP R (2.4)\n\nwhere V\nP \nand V\n\nR\n  are the electrostatic potentials at P and R, respectively.\n\nNote, as before, that it is not the actual value of potential but the potential\ndifference that is physically significant. If, as before, we choose the\npotential to be zero at infinity, Eq. (2.4) implies:\n\nWork done by an external force in bringing a unit positive charge\nfrom infinity to a point = electrostatic potential (V ) at that point.\n\nC\nO\n\nU\nN\n\nT\n A\n\nL\nE\n\nS\nS\n\nA\nN\n\nD\nR\n\nO\n V\n\nO\nL\nT\nA\n\n (1\n7\n4\n5\n –1\n\n8\n2\n7\n)\n\nCount Alessandro Volta\n\n(1745 – 1827) Italian\nphysicist, professor at\nPavia. Volta established\nthat the animal electri-\ncity observed by Luigi\nGalvani, 1737–1798, in\nexperiments with frog\nmuscle tissue placed in\ncontact with dissimilar\nmetals, was not due to\nany exceptional property\nof animal tissues but\nwas also generated\nwhenever any wet body\nwas sandwiched between\ndissimilar metals. This\nled him to develop the\nfirst voltaic  pile , or\nbattery, consisting of a\nlarge stack of moist disks\nof cardboard (electro-\nlyte) sandwiched\nbetween disks of metal\n(electrodes).\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n54\n\nIn other words, the electrostatic potential (V )\nat any point in a region with electrostatic field is\nthe work done in bringing a unit positive\ncharge (without acceleration) from infinity to\nthat point.\n\nThe qualifying remarks made earlier regarding\npotential energy also apply to the definition of\npotential. To obtain the work done per unit test\ncharge, we should take an infinitesimal test charge\nδq, obtain the work done δW in bringing it from\ninfinity to the point and determine the ratio\nδW/δq. Also, the external force at every point of the\npath is to be equal and opposite to the electrostatic\nforce on the test charge at that point.\n\n2.3  POTENTIAL DUE TO A POINT CHARGE\nConsider a point charge Q at the origin (Fig. 2.3). For definiteness, take Q\nto be positive. We wish to determine the potential at any point P with\n\nposition vector r from the origin. For that we must\ncalculate the work done in bringing a unit positive\ntest charge from infinity to the point P. For Q > 0,\nthe work done against the repulsive force on the\ntest charge is positive. Since work done is\nindependent of the path, we choose a convenient\npath – along the radial direction from infinity to\nthe point P.\n\nAt some intermediate point P′ on the path, the\nelectrostatic force on a unit positive charge is\n\n2\n0\n\n1\nˆ\n\n4 '\nQ\n\nrε\n×\n\n′\nπ\n\nr (2.5)\n\nwhere ˆ ′r is the unit vector along OP′. Work done\nagainst this force from  r′ to r′ + ∆r′ is\n\n2\n04 '\n\nQ\nW r\n\nrε\n∆ = − ∆ ′\n\nπ (2.6)\n\nThe negative sign appears because for ∆r ′ < 0, ∆W is positive. Total\nwork done (W) by the external force is obtained by integrating Eq. (2.6)\nfrom r′ = ∞ to r′ = r,\n\nW\nQ\n\nr\ndr\n\nQ\n\nr\n\nQ\n\nr\n\nr r\n\n= −\n′\n\n′ =\n′\n\n=\n∞ ∞\n∫ 4 4 40 2 0 0π π πε ε ε (2.7)\n\nThis, by definition is the potential at P due to the charge Q\n\n0\n\n( )\n4\n\nQ\nV r\n\nrε\n=\n\nπ (2.8)\n\nFIGURE 2.2 Work done on a test charge q\nby the electrostatic field due to any given\n\ncharge configuration is independent\nof the path, and depends only on\n\nits initial and final positions.\n\nFIGURE 2.3 Work done in bringing a unit\npositive test charge from infinity to the\npoint P, against the repulsive force of\n\ncharge Q (Q > 0), is the potential at P due to\nthe charge Q.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectrostatic Potential\n\nand Capacitance\n\n55\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 2\n\n.1\n\nEquation (2.8) is true for any\nsign of the charge Q, though we\nconsidered Q > 0 in its derivation.\nFor Q < 0, V < 0, i.e., work done (by\nthe external force) per unit positive\ntest charge in bringing it from\ninfinity to the point is negative. This\nis equivalent to saying that work\ndone by the electrostatic force in\nbringing the unit positive charge\nform infinity to the point P is\npositive. [This is as it should be,\nsince for Q < 0, the force on a unit\npositive test charge is attractive, so\nthat the electrostatic force and the\ndisplacement (from infinity to P) are\nin the same direction.] Finally, we\nnote that Eq. (2.8) is consistent with\nthe choice that potential at infinity\nbe zero.\n\nFigure (2.4) shows how the electrostatic potential ( ∝ 1/r ) and the\nelectrostatic field ( ∝ 1/r\n\n2 ) varies with r.\n\nExample 2.1\n\n(a) Calculate the potential at a point P due to a charge of 4 × 10–7C\nlocated 9 cm away.\n\n(b) Hence obtain the work done in bringing a charge of 2 × 10–9 C\nfrom infinity to the point P. Does the answer depend on the path\nalong which the charge is brought?\n\nSolution\n\n(a)  \n\n          = 4 × 104 V\n\n(b) W = qV = 2 × 10–9C × 4 × 104V\n     = 8 × 10–5 J\n\nNo, work done will be path independent. Any arbitrary infinitesimal\npath can be resolved into two perpendicular displacements: One along\nr and another perpendicular to r. The work done corresponding to\nthe later will be zero.\n\n2.4  POTENTIAL DUE TO AN ELECTRIC DIPOLE\nAs we learnt in the last chapter, an electric dipole consists of two charges\nq and  –q separated by a (small) distance 2a. Its total charge is zero. It is\ncharacterised by a dipole moment vector p whose magnitude is q × 2a\nand which points in the direction from –q to q (Fig. 2.5). We also saw that\nthe electric field of a dipole at a point with position vector r depends not\njust on the magnitude r, but also on the angle between r and p. Further,\n\nFIGURE 2.4 Variation of potential V with r [in units of\n(Q/4πε0) m\n\n-1] (blue curve) and field with r [in units\nof (Q/4πε0) m\n\n-2] (black curve) for a point charge Q.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n56\n\nthe field falls off, at large distance, not as\n1/r 2 (typical of field due to a single charge)\nbut as 1/r3. We, now, determine the electric\npotential due to a dipole and contrast it\nwith the potential due to a single charge.\n\nAs before, we take the origin at the\ncentre of the dipole. Now we know that the\nelectric field obeys the superposition\nprinciple. Since potential is related to the\nwork done by the field, electrostatic\npotential also follows the superposition\nprinciple. Thus, the potential due to the\ndipole is the sum of potentials due to the\ncharges q and –q\n\nV\nq\n\nr\n\nq\n\nr\n= −\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n1\n4 0 1 2πε\n\n(2.9)\n\nwhere r\n1\n and r\n\n2\n are the distances of the\n\npoint P from q and –q, respectively.\nNow, by geometry,\n\n2 2 2\n1 2r r a ar= + − cosθ\n\n2 2 2\n2 2r r a ar= + +  cosθ (2.10)\n\nWe take r much greater than a ( ar >> ) and retain terms only upto\nthe first order in a/r\n\n  r r\na\n\nr\n\na\n\nr\n1\n2 2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n= − +\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\ncosθ\n\n  ≅ −\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\nr\na\n\nr\n\n2 1\n2 cosθ\n\n(2.11)\n\n Similarly,\n\n  r r\na\n\nr\n2\n2 2 1\n\n2\n≅ +\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\ncosθ\n(2.12)\n\nUsing the Binomial theorem and retaining terms upto the first order\nin a/r ; we obtain,\n\n1 1\n1\n\n2 1\n1\n\n1\n\n1 2\n\nr r\n\na\n\nr r\n\na\n\nr\n≅ −\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n≅ +\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n−\ncos\n\ncos\n/\n\nθ\nθ [2.13(a)]\n\n1 1\n1\n\n2 1\n1\n\n2\n\n1 2\n\nr r\n\na\n\nr r\n\na\n\nr\n≅ +\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n≅ −\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n−\ncos\n\ncos\n/\n\nθ\nθ [2.13(b)]\n\n Using Eqs.

For a point dipole p at the origin, Eq. (2.15) is, however,\nexact.\n\nFrom Eq. (2.15), potential on the dipole axis (θ = 0, π ) is given by\n\n2\n0\n\n1\n4\n\np\nV\n\nrε\n= ±\n\nπ (2.16)\n\n(Positive sign for θ = 0, negative sign for θ = π.) The potential in the\nequatorial plane (θ = π/2) is zero.\n\nThe important contrasting features of electric potential of a dipole\nfrom that due to a single charge are clear from Eqs. (2.8) and (2.15):\n(i) The potential due to a dipole depends not just on r but also on the\n\nangle between the position vector  r and the dipole moment vector p.\n(It is, however, axially symmetric about p. That is, if you rotate the\nposition vector r  about  p, keeping θ fixed, the points corresponding\nto P on the cone so generated will have the same potential as at P.)\n\n(ii) The electric dipole potential falls off, at large distance, as 1/r 2, not as\n1/r, characteristic of the potential due to a single charge. (You can\nrefer to the Fig. 2.5 for graphs of 1/r 2 versus r and 1/r versus r,\ndrawn there in another context.)\n\n2.5  POTENTIAL DUE TO A SYSTEM OF CHARGES\nConsider a system of charges q\n\n1\n, q\n\n2\n,…, q\n\nn\n with position vectors r\n\n1\n, r\n\n2\n,…,\n\nrn relative to some origin (Fig. 2.6).

By the\nsuperposition principle, the potential V at P due\nto the total charge configuration is the algebraic\nsum of the potentials due to the individual\ncharges\n\nV = V1 + V2 + ... + Vn (2.17)\n\nFIGURE 2.6 Potential at a point due to a\nsystem of charges is the sum of potentials\n\ndue to individual charges.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n58  E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 2\n\n.2\n\n= + + +\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n1\n4 0\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2πε\nq\n\nr\n\nq\n\nr\n\nq\n\nr\n\nn\n\nnP P P\n\n...... (2.18)\n\nIf we have a continuous charge distribution characterised by a charge\ndensity ρ (r), we divide it, as before, into small volume elements each of\nsize ∆v and carrying a charge ρ∆v. We then determine the potential due\nto each volume element and sum (strictly speaking , integrate) over all\nsuch contributions, and thus determine the potential due to the entire\ndistribution.\n\nWe have seen in Chapter 1 that for a uniformly charged spherical shell,\nthe electric field outside the shell is as if the entire charge is concentrated\nat the centre. Thus, the potential outside the shell is given by\n\n0\n\n1\n4\n\nq\nV\n\nrε\n=\n\nπ    ( )r R≥ [2.19(a)]\n\nwhere q is the total charge on the shell and R its radius.

For a single charge q, the potential is given\nby Eq. (2.8):\n\n1\n4 o\n\nq\nV\n\nrε\n=\n\nπ\nThis shows that V is a constant if r is constant. Thus, equipotential\n\nsurfaces of a single point charge are concentric spherical surfaces centred\nat the charge.\n\nNow the electric field lines for a single charge q are radial lines starting\nfrom or ending at the charge, depending on whether q is positive or negative.\nClearly, the electric field at every point is normal to the equipotential surface\npassing through that point. This is true in general: for any charge\nconfiguration, equipotential surface through a point is normal to the\nelectric field at that point. The proof of this statement is simple.\n\nIf the field were not normal to the equipotential surface, it would\nhave non-zero component along the surface. To move a unit test charge\nagainst the direction of the component of the field, work would have to\nbe done. But this is in contradiction to the definition of an equipotential\nsurface: there is no potential difference between any two points on the\nsurface and no work is required to move a test charge on the surface.\nThe electric field must, therefore, be normal to the equipotential surface\nat every point. Equipotential surfaces offer an alternative visual picture\nin addition to the picture of electric field lines around a charge\nconfiguration.\n\nFIGURE 2.9 For a\nsingle charge q\n\n(a) equipotential\nsurfaces are\n\nspherical surfaces\ncentred at the\ncharge, and\n\n(b) electric field\nlines are radial,\nstarting from the\ncharge if q > 0.\n\nFor a uniform electric field E, say, along the x -axis, the equipotential\nsurfaces are planes normal to the x -axis, i.e., planes parallel to the y-z\nplane (Fig. 2.10). Equipotential surfaces for (a) a dipole and (b) two\nidentical positive charges  are shown in Fig. 2.11.\n\nFIGURE 2.11 Some equipotential surfaces for (a) a dipole,\n(b) two identical positive charges.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectrostatic Potential\n\nand Capacitance\n\n61\n\n2.6.1  Relation between field and potential\n\nConsider two closely spaced equipotential surfaces A and B (Fig. 2.12)\nwith potential values V and V + δ V, where δ V is the change in V in the\ndirection of the electric field E. Let P be a point on the\nsurface B. δ l is the perpendicular distance of the\nsurface A from P. Imagine that a unit positive charge\nis moved along this perpendicular from the surface B\nto surface A against the electric field. The work done\nin this process is |E|δ l.\n\nThis work equals the potential difference\nV\n\nA\n–V\n\nB\n.\n\nThus,\n\n|E|δ l = V – (V + δV )= – δV\n\ni.e., |E|= −\nδ\n\nδ\n\nV\n\nl\n(2.20)\n\nSince δV is negative, δV = – |δV|. we can rewrite\nEq (2.20) as\n\nE = − = +\nδ\n\nδ\n\nδ\n\nδ\n\nV\n\nl\n\nV\n\nl\n(2.21)\n\nWe thus arrive at two important conclusions concerning the relation\nbetween electric field and potential:\n(i) Electric field is in the direction in which the potential decreases\n\nsteepest.\n\n(ii) Its magnitude is given by the change in the magnitude of potential\nper unit displacement normal to the equipotential surface at the point.\n\n2.7  POTENTIAL ENERGY OF A SYSTEM OF CHARGES\nConsider first the simple case of two charges q\n\n1\nand q\n\n2\n with position vector\n\nr1 and r2 relative to some origin. Let us calculate the work done\n(externally) in building up this configuration. This means that we consider\nthe charges q\n\n1\n and q\n\n2\n initially at infinity and determine the work done by\n\nan external agency to bring the charges to the given locations. Suppose,\nfirst the charge q\n\n1\n is brought from infinity to the point r\n\n1\n. There is no\n\nexternal field against which work needs to be done, so work done in\nbringing q1 from infinity to r1 is zero. This charge produces a potential in\nspace given by\n\nV\nq\n\nr\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n4\n\n=\nπε P\n\nwhere r\n1P\n\n is the distance of a point P in space from the location of q\n1\n.\n\nFrom the definition of potential, work done in bringing charge q2 from\ninfinity to the point r\n\n2\n is q\n\n2 \ntimes the potential at r\n\n2\n due to q\n\n1\n:\n\nwork done on q\n2 \n= \n\n1\n4 0\n\n1 2\n\n12πε\nq q\n\nr\n\nFIGURE 2.12 From the\npotential to the field.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n62\n\nwhere r\n12\n\n is the distance between points 1 and 2.\nSince electrostatic force is conservative, this work gets\n\nstored in the form of potential energy of the system. Thus,\nthe potential energy of a system of two charges q\n\n1 \nand q\n\n2\n is\n\nU\nq q\n\nr\n=\n\n1\n4 0\n\n1 2\n\n12πε\n(2.22)\n\nObviously, if q\n2\n was brought first to its present location and\n\nq\n1\n brought later, the potential energy U would be the same.\n\nMore generally, the potential energy expression,\nEq. (2.22), is unaltered whatever way the charges are brought to the specified\nlocations, because of path-independence of work for electrostatic force.\n\nEquation (2.22) is true for any sign of  q1and q2. If q1q2 > 0, potential\nenergy is positive. This is as expected, since for like charges (q\n\n1\nq\n\n2 \n> 0),\n\nelectrostatic force is repulsive and a positive amount of work is needed to\nbe done against this force to bring the charges from infinity to a finite\ndistance apart. For unlike charges (q\n\n1 \nq\n\n2 \n< 0), the electrostatic force is\n\nattractive. In that case, a positive amount of work is needed against this\nforce to take the charges from the given location to infinity. In other words,\na negative amount of work is needed for the reverse path (from infinity to\nthe present locations), so the potential energy is negative.\n\nEquation (2.22) is easily generalised for a system of any number of\npoint charges. Let us calculate the potential energy of a system of three\ncharges q\n\n1\n,\n \nq\n\n2 \nand q\n\n3\n located at r\n\n1\n,\n \nr\n\n2\n, r\n\n3\n, respectively. To bring q\n\n1\n first\n\nfrom infinity to r1, no work is required. Next we bring q2 from infinity to\nr\n\n2\n.

The electrostatic potential at\nE is clearly zero since potential due to A and C is cancelled by that\ndue to B and D. Hence, no work is required to bring any charge to\npoint E.\n\n2.8  POTENTIAL ENERGY IN AN EXTERNAL FIELD\n\n2.8.1  Potential energy of a single charge\n\nIn Section 2.7, the source of the electric field was specified – the charges\nand their locations - and the potential energy of the system of those charges\nwas  determined. In this section, we ask a related but a distinct question.\nWhat is the potential energy of a charge q in a given field? This question\nwas, in fact, the starting point that led us to the notion of the electrostatic\npotential (Sections 2.1 and 2.2). But here we address this question again\nto clarify in what way it is different from the discussion in Section 2.7.\n\nThe main difference is that we are now concerned with the potential\nenergy of a charge (or charges) in an external field. The external field E is\nnot produced by the given charge(s) whose potential energy we wish to\ncalculate. E is produced by sources external to the given charge(s).The\nexternal sources may be known, but often they are unknown or\nunspecified; what is specified is the electric field E or the electrostatic\npotential V due to the external sources. We assume that the charge q\ndoes not significantly affect the sources producing the external field. This\nis true if q is very small, or the external sources are held fixed by other\nunspecified forces. Even if q is finite, its influence on the external sources\nmay still be ignored in the situation when very strong sources far away\nat infinity produce a finite field E in the region of interest. Note again that\nwe are interested in determining the potential energy of a given charge q\n(and later, a system of charges) in the external field; we are not interested\nin the potential energy of the sources producing the external electric field.\n\nThe external electric field E and the corresponding external potential\nV may vary from point to point. By definition, V at a point P is the work\ndone in bringing a unit positive charge from infinity to the point P.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectrostatic Potential\n\nand Capacitance\n\n65\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 2\n\n.5\n\n(We continue to take potential at infinity to be zero.) Thus, work done in\nbringing a charge q from infinity to the point P in the external field is qV.\nThis work is stored in the form of potential energy of q. If the point P has\nposition vector r relative to some origin, we can write:\n\nPotential energy of q at r in an external field\n\n= qV (r) (2.27)\n\nwhere V(r) is the external potential at the point r.\nThus, if an electron with charge q = e = 1.6×10–19 C is accelerated by\n\na potential difference of ∆V = 1 volt, it would gain energy of q∆V = 1.6 ×\n10–19J. This unit of energy is defined as 1 electron volt or 1eV, i.e.,\n1 eV=1.6 × 10–19J. The units based on eV are most commonly used in\natomic, nuclear and particle physics, (1 keV = 103eV = 1.6 × 10–16J, 1 MeV\n= 106eV = 1.6 × 10–13J, 1 GeV = 109eV = 1.6 × 10–10J and 1 TeV = 1012eV\n= 1.6 × 10–7J). [This has already been defined on Page 117, XI Physics\nPart I, Table 6.1.]\n\n2.8.2 Potential energy of a system of two charges in an\nexternal field\n\nNext, we ask: what is the potential energy of a system of two charges q1\nand q\n\n2 \nlocated at r\n\n1\nand r\n\n2\n, respectively, in an external field? First, we\n\ncalculate the work done in bringing the charge q\n1\n from infinity to r\n\n1\n.\n\nWork done in this step is q1 V(r1), using Eq. (2.27). Next, we consider the\nwork done in bringing q\n\n2 \nto r\n\n2\n. In this step, work is done not only against\n\nthe external field E but also against the field due to q\n1\n.\n\nWork done on q2 against the external field\n= q\n\n2 \nV (r\n\n2\n)\n\nWork done on q\n2 \nagainst the field due to q\n\n1\n\n1 2\n\n12\n4 o\n\nq q\n\nrε\n=\n\nπ\nwhere  r\n\n12 \nis the distance between q\n\n1 \nand q\n\n2\n. We have made use of Eqs.\n\n(2.27) and (2.22). By the superposition principle for fields, we add up\nthe work done on q2 against the two fields (E and that due to q1):\n\nWork done in bringing q\n2 \nto r\n\n2\n\n1 2\n\n2 2\n\n12\n\n( )\n4 o\n\nq q\nq V\n\nrε\n= +\n\nπ\nr (2.28)\n\nThus,\n Potential energy of the system\n= the total work done in assembling the configuration\n\n1 2\n\n1 1 2 2\n\n0 12\n\n( ) ( )\n4\n\nq q\nq V q V\n\nrε\n= + +\n\nπ\nr r  (2.29)\n\nExample 2.5\n\n(a) Determine the electrostatic potential energy of a system consisting\nof  two charges 7 µC and –2 µC (and with no external field) placed\nat (–9 cm, 0, 0) and (9 cm, 0, 0) respectively.\n\n(b) How much work is required to separate the two charges infinitely\naway from each other?\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n66\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 2\n\n.5\n\n(c) Suppose that the same system of charges is now placed in an\nexternal electric field E = A (1/r 2); A = 9 × 105 NC–1 m2.

A natural choice\nis to take θ0 = π / 2. (Αn explanation for it is provided towards the end of\ndiscussion.)

This must be the energy released\nby the substance in the form of heat in aligning its dipoles.\n\n2.9  ELECTROSTATICS OF CONDUCTORS\nConductors and insulators were described briefly in Chapter 1.\nConductors contain mobile charge carriers. In metallic conductors, these\ncharge carriers are electrons. In a metal, the outer (valence) electrons\npart away from their atoms and are free to move. These electrons are free\nwithin the metal but not free  to leave the metal. The free electrons form a\nkind of ‘gas’; they collide with each other and with the ions, and move\nrandomly in different directions. In an external electric field, they drift\nagainst the direction of the field. The positive ions made up of the nuclei\nand the bound electrons remain held in their fixed positions. In electrolytic\nconductors, the charge carriers are both positive and negative ions; but\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n68\n\nthe situation in this case is more involved – the movement of the charge\ncarriers is affected both by the external electric field as also by the\nso-called chemical forces (see Chapter 3). We shall restrict our discussion\nto metallic solid conductors. Let us note important results regarding\nelectrostatics of conductors.\n\n1. Inside a conductor, electrostatic field is zero\n\nConsider a conductor, neutral or charged. There may also be an external\nelectrostatic field. In the static situation, when there is no current inside\nor on the surface of the conductor, the electric field is zero everywhere\ninside the conductor. This fact can be taken as the defining property of a\nconductor. A conductor has free electrons. As long as electric field is not\nzero, the free charge carriers would experience force and drift. In the\nstatic situation, the free charges have so distributed themselves that the\nelectric field is zero everywhere inside. Electrostatic field is zero inside a\nconductor.\n\n2. At the surface of a charged conductor, electrostatic field\nmust be normal to the surface at every point\n\nIf E were not normal to the surface, it would have some non-zero\ncomponent along the surface. Free charges on the surface of the conductor\nwould then experience force and move. In the static situation, therefore,\nE should have no tangential component. Thus electrostatic field at the\nsurface of a charged conductor must be normal to the surface at every\n\npoint. (For a conductor without any surface charge density, field is zero\neven at the surface.) See result 5.\n\n3. The interior of a conductor can have no excess charge in\nthe static situation\n\nA neutral conductor has equal amounts of positive and negative charges\nin every small volume or surface element. When the conductor is charged,\nthe excess charge can reside only on the surface in the static situation.\nThis follows from the Gauss’s law. Consider any arbitrary volume element\nv inside a conductor. On the closed surface S bounding the volume\nelement v, electrostatic field is zero. Thus the total electric flux through S\nis zero. Hence, by Gauss’s law, there is no net charge enclosed by S. But\nthe surface S can be made as small as you like, i.e., the volume v can be\nmade vanishingly small. This means there is no net charge at any point\ninside the conductor, and any excess charge must reside at the surface.\n\n4. Electrostatic potential is constant throughout the volume\nof the conductor and has the same value (as inside) on\nits surface\n\nThis follows from results 1 and 2 above. Since E = 0 inside the conductor\nand has no tangential component on the surface, no work is done in\nmoving a small test charge within the conductor and on its surface. That\nis, there is no potential difference between any two points inside or on\nthe surface of the conductor. Hence, the result. If the conductor is charged,\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectrostatic Potential\n\nand Capacitance\n\n69\n\nelectric field normal to the surface exists; this means potential will be\ndifferent for the surface and a point just outside the surface.\n\nIn a system of conductors of arbitrary size, shape and\ncharge configuration, each conductor is characterised by a constant\nvalue of potential, but this constant may differ from one conductor to\nthe other.\n\n5. Electric field at the surface of a charged conductor\n\n0\n\nˆ\nσ\nε\n\n=E n (2.35)\n\nwhere σ is the surface charge density and n̂  is a unit vector normal\nto the surface in the outward direction.\n\nTo derive the result, choose a pill box (a short cylinder) as the Gaussian\nsurface about any point P on the surface, as shown in Fig. 2.17. The pill\nbox is partly inside and partly outside the surface of the conductor. It\nhas a small area of cross section δ S and negligible height.\n\nJust inside the surface, the electrostatic field is zero; just outside, the\nfield is normal to the surface with magnitude E. Thus,\nthe contribution to the total flux through the pill box\ncomes only from the outside (circular) cross-section\nof the pill box. This equals  ± EδS (positive for σ > 0,\nnegative for σ < 0), since over the small area δS, E\nmay be considered constant and E and δS are parallel\nor antiparallel. The charge enclosed by the pill box\nis  σδS.\nBy Gauss’s law\n\nEδS = \n0\n\nSσ δ\nε\n\nE = \n0\n\nσ\nε\n\n(2.36)\n\nIncluding the fact that electric field is normal to the\nsurface, we get the vector relation, Eq. (2.35), which\nis true for both signs of σ. For σ > 0, electric field is\nnormal to the surface outward; for σ < 0, electric field\nis normal to the surface inward.\n\n6. Electrostatic shielding\n\nConsider a conductor with a cavity, with no charges inside the cavity. A\nremarkable result is that the electric field inside the cavity is zero, whatever\nbe the size and shape of the cavity and whatever be the charge on the\nconductor and the external fields in which it might be placed. We have\nproved a simple case of this result already: the electric field inside a charged\nspherical shell is zero. The proof of the result for the shell makes use of\nthe spherical symmetry of the shell (see Chapter 1). But the vanishing of\nelectric field in the (charge-free) cavity of a conductor is, as mentioned\nabove, a very general result. A related result is that even if the conductor\n\nFIGURE 2.17 The Gaussian surface\n(a pill box) chosen to derive Eq. (2.35)\n\nfor electric field at the surface of a\ncharged conductor.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n70  E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 2\n\n.7\n\nFIGURE 2.18 The electric field inside a\ncavity of any conductor is zero. All\n\ncharges reside only on the outer surface\nof a conductor with cavity. (There are no\n\ncharges placed in the cavity.)\n\nis charged or charges are induced on a neutral\nconductor by an external field, all charges reside\nonly on the outer surface of a conductor with cavity.\n\nThe proofs of the results noted in Fig. 2.18 are\nomitted here, but we note their important\nimplication. Whatever be the charge and field\nconfiguration outside, any cavity in a conductor\nremains shielded from outside electric influence: the\nfield inside the cavity is always zero. This is known\nas electrostatic shielding. The effect can be made\nuse of in protecting sensitive instruments from\noutside electrical influence. Figure 2.19 gives a\nsummary of the important electrostatic properties\nof a conductor.\n\nExample 2.7\n(a) A comb run through one’s dry hair attracts small bits of paper.\n\nWhy?\nWhat happens if the hair is wet or if it is a rainy day?

Why?\n\n(d) A bird perches on a bare high power line, and nothing happens\nto the bird. A man standing on the ground touches the same line\nand gets a fatal shock. Why?\n\nSolution\n(a) This is because the comb gets charged by friction. The molecules\n\nin the paper gets polarised by the charged comb, resulting  in a\nnet force of attraction. If the hair is wet, or if it is rainy day, friction\nbetween hair and the comb reduces. The comb does not get\ncharged and thus it will not attract small bits of paper.\n\nFIGURE 2.19 Some important electrostatic properties of a conductor.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectrostatic Potential\n\nand Capacitance\n\n71\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 2\n\n.7\n\n(b) To enable them to conduct charge (produced by friction) to the\nground;  as too much of static electricity accumulated may result\nin spark and result in fire.\n\n(c) Reason similar to (b).\n\n(d) Current passes only when there is difference in potential.\n\n2.10  DIELECTRICS AND POLARISATION\nDielectrics are non-conducting substances. In contrast to conductors,\nthey have no (or negligible number of ) charge carriers. Recall from Section\n2.9 what happens when a conductor is placed in an\nexternal electric field. The free charge carriers move\nand charge distribution in the conductor adjusts\nitself in such a way that the electric field due to\ninduced charges opposes the external field within\nthe conductor. This happens until, in the static\nsituation, the two fields cancel each other and the\nnet electrostatic field in the conductor is zero. In a\ndielectric, this free movement of charges is not\npossible. It turns out that the external field induces\ndipole moment by stretching or re-orienting\nmolecules of the dielectric. The collective effect of all\nthe molecular dipole moments is net charges on the\nsurface of the dielectric which produce a field that\nopposes the external field. Unlike in a conductor,\nhowever, the opposing field so induced does not\nexactly cancel the external field. It only reduces it.\nThe extent of the effect depends on the\nnature of the dielectric. To understand the\neffect, we need to look at the charge\ndistribution of a dielectric at the\nmolecular level.\n\nThe molecules of a substance may be\npolar or non-polar. In a non-polar\nmolecule, the centres of positive and\nnegative charges coincide. The molecule\nthen has no permanent (or intrinsic) dipole\nmoment. Examples of non-polar molecules\nare oxygen (O\n\n2\n) and hydrogen (H\n\n2\n)\n\nmolecules which, because of their\nsymmetry, have no dipole moment. On the\nother hand, a polar molecule is one in which\nthe centres of positive and negative charges\nare separated (even when there is no\nexternal field). Such molecules have a\npermanent dipole moment. An ionic\nmolecule such as HCl or a molecule of water\n(H\n\n2\nO) are examples of polar molecules.\n\nFIGURE 2.20 Difference in behaviour\nof a conductor and a dielectric\n\nin an external electric field.\n\nFIGURE 2.21 Some examples of polar\nand non-polar molecules.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n72\n\nIn an external electric field, the\npositive and negative charges of a non-\npolar molecule are displaced in opposite\ndirections. The displacement stops when\nthe external force on the constituent\ncharges of the molecule is balanced by\nthe restoring force (due to internal fields\nin the molecule). The non-polar molecule\nthus develops an induced dipole moment.\nThe dielectric is said to be polarised by\nthe external field. We consider only the\nsimple situation when the induced dipole\nmoment is in the direction of the field and\nis proportional to the field strength.\n(Substances for which this assumption\nis true are called l inear isotropic\ndielectrics.) The induced dipole moments\nof different molecules add up giving a net\ndipole moment of the dielectric in the\npresence of the external field.\n\nA dielectric with polar molecules also\ndevelops a net dipole moment in an\nexternal field, but for a different reason.\nIn the absence of any external field, the\ndifferent permanent dipoles are oriented\nrandomly due to thermal agitation; so\nthe total dipole moment is zero. When\n\nan external field is applied, the individual dipole moments tend  to align\nwith the field. When summed overall the molecules, there is then a net\ndipole moment in the direction of the external field, i.e., the dielectric is\npolarised. The extent of polarisation depends on the relative strength of\ntwo mutually opposite factors: the dipole potential energy in the external\nfield tending to align the dipoles with the field and thermal energy tending\nto disrupt the alignment. There may be, in addition, the  ‘induced dipole\nmoment’ effect as for non-polar molecules, but generally the alignment\neffect is more important for polar molecules.\n\nThus in either case, whether polar or non-polar, a dielectric develops\na net dipole moment in the presence of an external field. The dipole\nmoment per unit volume is called polarisation and is denoted by P. For\nlinear isotropic dielectrics,\n\n0ε χ=P Ee (2.37)\nwhere χ\n\ne\n is a constant characteristic of the dielectric and is known as the\n\nelectric susceptibility of the dielectric medium.\nIt is possible to relate χ\n\ne\n to the molecular properties of the substance,\n\nbut we shall not pursue that here.\nThe question is: how does the polarised dielectric modify the original\n\nexternal field inside it? Let us consider, for simplicity, a rectangular\ndielectric slab placed in a uniform external field E0 parallel to two of its\nfaces. The field causes a uniform polarisation P of the dielectric. Thus\n\nFIGURE 2.22 A dielectric develops a net dipole\nmoment in an external electric field. (a) Non-polar\n\nmolecules, (b) Polar molecules.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectrostatic Potential\n\nand Capacitance\n\n73\n\nevery volume element ∆v of the slab has a dipole moment\nP ∆v in the direction of the field. The volume element ∆v  is\nmacroscopically small but contains a very large number of\nmolecular dipoles. Anywhere inside the dielectric, the\nvolume element ∆v has no net charge (though it has net\ndipole moment). This is, because, the positive charge of one\ndipole sits close to the negative charge of the adjacent dipole.\nHowever, at the surfaces of the dielectric normal to the\nelectric field, there is evidently a net charge density. As seen\nin Fig 2.23, the positive ends of the dipoles remain\nunneutralised at the right surface and the negative ends at\nthe left surface. The unbalanced charges are the induced\ncharges due to the external field.\n\nThus, the polarised dielectric is equivalent to two charged\nsurfaces with induced surface charge densities, say σ\n\np\n\nand –σ\np\n. Clearly, the field produced by these surface charges\n\nopposes the external field. The total field in the dielectric\nis, thereby, reduced from the case when no dielectric is\npresent. We should note that the surface charge density\n±σ\n\np \narises from bound (not free charges) in the dielectric.\n\n2.11  CAPACITORS AND CAPACITANCE\nA capacitor is a system of two conductors separated by an insulator\n(Fig. 2.24). The conductors have charges, say Q\n\n1\n and Q\n\n2\n, and potentials\n\nV1 and V2. Usually, in practice, the two conductors have charges Q\nand – Q, with potential difference V = V\n\n1\n – V\n\n2\n between them. We shall\n\nconsider only this kind of charge configuration of the capacitor. (Even a\nsingle conductor can be used as a capacitor by assuming the other at\ninfinity.) The conductors may be so charged by connecting them to the\ntwo terminals of a battery. Q is called the charge of the capacitor, though\nthis, in fact, is the charge on one of the conductors – the total charge  of\nthe capacitor  is zero.\n\nThe electric field in the region between the\nconductors is proportional to the charge Q. That\nis, if the charge on the capacitor is, say  doubled,\nthe electric field will also be doubled at every point.\n(This follows from the direct proportionality\nbetween field and charge implied by Coulomb’s\nlaw and the superposition principle.) Now,\npotential difference V is the work done per unit\npositive charge in taking a small test charge from\nthe conductor 2 to 1 against the field.\nConsequently, V is also proportional to Q, and the\nratio Q/V is a constant:\n\nQ\nC\n\nV\n= (2.38)\n\nThe constant C is called the capacitance of the capacitor. C is independent\nof Q or V, as stated above. The capacitance C depends only on the\n\nFIGURE 2.23 A uniformly\npolarised dielectric amounts\nto induced surface charge\n\ndensity, but no volume\ncharge density.\n\nFIGURE 2.24 A system of two conductors\nseparated by an insulator forms a capacitor.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n74\n\ngeometrical configuration (shape, size, separation) of the system of two\nconductors. [As we shall see later, it also depends on the nature of the\ninsulator (dielectric) separating the two conductors.]  The SI unit of\ncapacitance is 1 farad (=1 coulomb volt-1) or 1 F = 1 C V –1. A capacitor\nwith fixed capacitance is symbolically shown as ---||---, while the one with\nvariable capacitance is shown as  .\n\nEquation (2.38) shows that for large C, V is small for a given Q. This\nmeans a capacitor with large capacitance can hold large amount of charge\nQ at a relatively small V. This is of practical importance. High potential\ndifference implies strong electric field around the conductors. A strong\nelectric field can ionise the surrounding air and accelerate the charges so\nproduced to the oppositely charged plates, thereby neutralising the charge\non the capacitor plates, at least partly. In other words, the charge of the\ncapacitor leaks away due to the reduction in insulating power of the\nintervening medium.\n\nThe maximum electric field that a dielectric medium can withstand\nwithout break-down (of its insulating property) is called its dielectric\nstrength; for air it is about 3 × 106 Vm–1. For a separation between\nconductors of the order of 1 cm or so, this field corresponds to a potential\ndifference of 3 × 104 V between the conductors. Thus, for a capacitor to\nstore a large amount of charge without  leaking, its capacitance should\nbe high enough so that the potential difference and hence the electric\nfield do not exceed the break-down limits. Put differently, there is a limit\nto the amount of charge that can be stored on a given capacitor without\nsignificant leaking. In practice, a farad is a very big unit; the most common\nunits are its sub-multiples 1 µF = 10–6 F, 1 nF = 10–9 F, 1 pF = 10–12 F,\netc. Besides its use in storing charge, a capacitor is a key element of most\nac circuits with important functions, as described in Chapter 7.\n\n2.12  THE PARALLEL PLATE CAPACITOR\nA parallel plate capacitor consists of two large plane parallel conducting\nplates separated by a small distance (Fig. 2.25). We first take the\n\nintervening medium between the plates to be\nvacuum. The effect of a dielectric medium between\nthe plates is discussed in the next section. Let A be\nthe area of each plate and d the separation between\nthem. The two plates have charges Q and –Q. Since\nd is much smaller than the linear dimension of the\nplates (d2 << A), we can use the result on electric\nfield by an infinite plane sheet of uniform surface\ncharge density (Section 1.15). Plate 1 has surface\ncharge density σ = Q/A and plate 2 has a surface\ncharge density –σ. Using Eq. (1.33), the electric field\nin different regions is:\n\nOuter region I (region  above the plate 1),\n\n0 0\n\n0\n2 2\n\nE\nσ σ\nε ε\n\n= − = (2.39)\n\nFIGURE 2.25  The parallel plate capacitor.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectrostatic Potential\n\nand Capacitance\n\n75\n\nOuter region II (region below the plate 2),\n\n0 0\n\n0\n2 2\n\nE\nσ σ\nε ε\n\n= − = (2.40)\n\nIn the inner region between the plates 1 and 2, the electric fields due\nto the two charged plates add up, giving\n\n0 0 0 02 2\nQ\n\nE\nA\n\nσ σ σ\nε ε ε ε\n\n= + = = (2.41)\n\nThe direction of electric field is from the positive to the negative plate.\nThus, the electric field is localised between the two plates and is\n\nuniform throughout. For plates with finite area, this will not be true near\nthe outer boundaries of the plates. The field lines bend outward at the\nedges — an effect called ‘fringing of the field’. By the same token, σ will\nnot be strictly uniform on the entire plate. [E and σ are related by Eq.\n(2.35).] However, for d2 << A, these effects can be ignored in the regions\nsufficiently far from the edges, and the field there is given by Eq. (2.41).\nNow for uniform electric field, potential difference is simply the electric\nfield times the distance between the plates, that is,\n\n0\n\n1 Qd\nV E d\n\nAε\n= = (2.42)\n\nThe capacitance C of the parallel plate capacitor is then\n\nQ\nC\n\nV\n=  = \n\n0A\n\nd\n\nε\n= (2.43)\n\nwhich, as expected, depends only on the geometry of the system. For\ntypical values like A = 1 m2, d = 1 mm, we get\n\n12 2 –1 –2 2\n9\n\n3\n\n8.85 10 C N m 1m\n8.85 10 F\n\n10 m\nC\n\n−\n−\n\n−\n\n× ×\n= = × (2.44)\n\n(You can check that if 1F= 1C V–1 = 1C (NC–1m)–1 = 1 C2 N–1m–1.)\nThis shows that 1F is too big a unit in practice, as remarked earlier.\nAnother way of seeing the ‘bigness’ of 1F is to calculate the area of the\nplates needed to have C = 1F for a separation of, say 1 cm:\n\n0\n\nCd\nA\n\nε\n= =\n\n2\n9 2\n\n12 2 –1 –2\n\n1F 10 m\n10 m\n\n8.85 10 C N m\n\n−\n\n−\n\n×\n=\n\n×\n(2.45)\n\nwhich is a plate about 30 km in length and breadth!\n\n2.13  EFFECT OF DIELECTRIC ON CAPACITANCE\nWith the understanding of the behaviour of dielectrics in an external\nfield developed in Section 2.10, let us see how the capacitance of a parallel\nplate capacitor is modified when a dielectric is present. As before, we\nhave two large plates, each of area A, separated by a distance d. The\ncharge on the plates is ±Q, corresponding to the charge density ±σ (with\nσ = Q/A).

The dielectric is polarised by the field and, as\nexplained in Section 2.10, the effect is equivalent to two charged sheets\n(at the surfaces of the dielectric normal to the field) with surface charge\ndensities σ\n\np\n and –σ\n\np\n. The electric field in the dielectric then corresponds\n\nto the case when the net surface charge density on the plates is ±(σ – σ\np\n).\n\nThat is,\n\n0\n\nPE\nσ σ\n\nε\n−\n\n= (2.47)\n\nso that the potential difference across the plates is\n\n0\n\nPV E d d\nσ σ\n\nε\n−\n\n= = (2.48)\n\nFor linear dielectrics, we expect σ\np\n to be proportional to E\n\n0\n, i.e., to σ.\n\nThus, (σ – σ\np\n)\n \nis proportional to σ  and we can write\n\nP\nK\n\nσ\nσ σ− = (2.49)\n\nwhere K is a constant characteristic of the dielectric.

(2.54) for the case of a parallel plate capacitor, it holds good for any\ntype of capacitor and can, in fact, be viewed in general as a definition of\nthe dielectric constant of a substance.\n\nELECTRIC DISPLACEMENT\n\nWe have introduced the notion of dielectric constant and arrived at Eq. (2.54), without\ngiving the explicit relation between the induced charge density σp and the polarisation P.\n\nWe take without proof the result that\n\nP\nˆσ •= P n\n\nwhere n̂  is a unit vector along the outward normal to the surface. Above equation is\ngeneral, true for any shape of the dielectric. For the slab in Fig. 2.23, P is along n̂  at the\nright surface and opposite to n̂  at the left surface. Thus at the right surface, induced\ncharge density is positive and at the left surface, it is negative, as guessed already in our\nqualitative discussion before.

It is a\n\nvector quantity. Thus,\n\nD = ε0 E + P, D ˆ• n  = σ,\nThe significance of D is this : in vacuum, E is related to the free charge density σ.\n\nWhen a dielectric medium is present, the corresponding role is taken up by D. For a\ndielectric medium, it is D not E that is directly related to free charge density σ, as seen in\nabove equation. Since P is in the same direction as E, all the three vectors P, E and D are\nparallel.\n\nThe ratio of the magnitudes of D and E is\n\n0\n0\n\nP\n\nD\nK\n\nE\n\nσε\nε\n\nσ σ\n= =\n\n−\n\nThus,\nD = ε\n\n0\n K E\n\nand P = D –ε0E = ε0 (K –1)E\nThis gives for the electric susceptibility χ\n\ne\n defined in Eq.

How is the capacitance\nchanged when the slab is inserted between the plates?\n\nSolution Let  E0 = V0/d be the electric field between the plates when\nthere is no dielectric and the potential difference is V0. If the dielectric\nis now inserted, the electric field in the dielectric will be E = E0/K.\nThe potential difference will then be\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n78\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 2\n\n.8\n\n0\n0\n\n1 3\n( ) ( )\n4 4\n\nE\nV E d d\n\nK\n= +\n\n0 0\n\n1 3 3\n( )\n4 4 4\n\nK\nE d V\n\nK K\n\n+\n= + =\n\nThe potential difference decreases by the factor (K + 3)/4K while the\nfree charge Q0 on the plates remains unchanged.

The effective capacitance\ndepends on the way the individual capacitors are combined. Two simple\npossibilities are discussed below.\n\n2.14.1  Capacitors in series\n\nFigure 2.26 shows capacitors C1 and C2 combined in series.\nThe left plate of C\n\n1 \nand the right plate of C\n\n2 \nare connected to two\n\nterminals of a battery and have charges Q and –Q ,\nrespectively. It then follows that the right plate of C1\nhas charge –Q and the left plate of C\n\n2 \n has charge Q.\n\nIf this was not so, the net charge on each capacitor\nwould not be zero. This would result in an electric\nfield in the conductor connecting C\n\n1\nand C\n\n2\n. Charge\n\nwould flow until the net charge on both C\n1 \nand C\n\n2\nis zero and there is no electric field in the conductor\nconnecting C\n\n1 \nand C\n\n2\n.\n \nThus, in the series\n\ncombination, charges on the two plates (±Q) are the\nsame on each capacitor. The total potential drop V\nacross the combination is the sum of the potential\ndrops V\n\n1\n and V\n\n2 \nacross C\n\n1\n and C\n\n2\n,\n \nrespectively.\n\nV = V\n1\n + V\n\n2\n = \n\n1 2\n\nQ Q\n\nC C\n+ (2.55)\n\ni.e., \n1 2\n\n1 1V\nQ C C\n\n= + , (2.56)\n\nNow we can regard the combination as an\neffective capacitor with charge Q and potential\ndifference V. The effective capacitance of the\ncombination is\n\nQ\nC\n\nV\n= (2.57)\n\nWe compare Eq. (2.57) with Eq.

In this case, the same potential difference is\napplied across both the capacitors. But the plate charges\n(±Q1) on capacitor 1 and the plate charges (±Q2) on the\ncapacitor 2 are not necessarily the same:\n\nQ\n1\n = C\n\n1\nV, Q\n\n2\n = C\n\n2\nV (2.61)\n\nThe equivalent capacitor is one with charge\nQ = Q1 + Q2 (2.62)\nand potential difference V.\nQ = CV = C\n\n1\nV + C\n\n2\nV (2.63)\n\nThe effective capacitance C is, from Eq. (2.63),\nC = C\n\n1\n + C\n\n2\n(2.64)\n\nThe general formula for effective capacitance C for\nparallel combination of n capacitors [Fig. 2.28 (b)]\nfollows similarly,\n\nQ = Q\n1\n + Q\n\n2 \n+ ... + Q\n\nn\n(2.65)\n\ni.e., CV = C\n1\nV + C\n\n2\nV + ...

Determine (a) the equivalent capacitance\nof the network and (b) the charge on each capacitor. (Note, the charge\non a capacitor is the charge on the plate with higher potential, equal\nand opposite to the charge on the plate with lower potential.)\n\nFIGURE 2.28 Parallel combination of\n(a) two capacitors, (b) n capacitors.\n\nFIGURE 2.29\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n80\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 2\n\n.9\n\nSolution\n(a) In the given network, C1, C2 and C3 are connected in series.

To determine the energy stored in this configuration,\nconsider initially two uncharged conductors 1 and 2. Imagine next a\nprocess of transferring charge from conductor 2 to conductor 1 bit by\n\nbit, so that at the end, conductor 1 gets charge Q. By\ncharge conservation, conductor 2 has charge –Q at\nthe end (Fig 2.30 ).\n\nIn transferring positive charge from conductor 2\nto conductor 1, work will be done externally, since at\nany stage conductor 1 is at a higher potential than\nconductor 2. To calculate the total work done, we first\ncalculate the work done in a small step involving\ntransfer of an infinitesimal (i.e., vanishingly small)\namount of charge. Consider the intermediate situation\nwhen the conductors 1 and 2 have charges Q′ and\n–Q′ respectively. At this stage, the potential difference\nV′ between conductors 1 to 2 is Q′/C, where C is the\ncapacitance of the system. Next imagine that a small\ncharge δ Q′ is transferred from conductor 2 to 1. Work\ndone in this step (δ W), resulting in charge Q ′ on\nconductor 1 increasing to Q′+ δ Q′, is given by\n\nQ\nW V Q Q\n\nC\nδ δ δ\n\n′\n= =′ ′ ′ (2.68)\n\nFIGURE 2.30 (a) Work done in a small\nstep of building charge on conductor 1\nfrom Q′ to Q′ + δ Q′. (b)  Total work done\n\nin charging the capacitor may be\nviewed as stored in the energy of\nelectric field between the plates.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectrostatic Potential\n\nand Capacitance\n\n81\n\nSince δ Q′ can be made as small as we like, Eq. (2.68) can be written  as\n\n2 21\n[( ) ]\n\n2\nW Q Q Q\n\nC\nδ δ= + −′ ′ ′ (2.69)\n\nEquations (2.68) and (2.69) are identical because the term of second\n\norder in δ Q′, i.e., δ Q′ 2/2C, is negligible, since δ Q′ is arbitrarily small. The\ntotal work done (W ) is the sum of the small work (δ W ) over the very large\nnumber of steps involved in building the charge Q′ from zero to Q.\n\nW W= ∑ δ\nsum over all steps\n\n     = \n1\n\n2\n\n2 2\n\nC\nQ Q Q\n\nsum over all steps\n\n∑ ′ + ′ − ′[( ) ]δ (2.70)\n\n     = \n2 2 21\n\n[{ 0} {(2 ) }\n2\n\nQ Q Q\nC\n\nδ δ δ− + −′ ′ ′ 2 2{(3 ) (2 ) } ...Q Qδ δ+ − +′ ′\n\n     2 2{ ( ) }]δ+ − −Q Q Q' (2.71)\n\n     \n\n2\n\n21\n[ 0]\n\n2 2\n\nQ\nQ\n\nC C\n= − = (2.72)\n\nThe same result can be obtained directly from Eq.

(2.72) in different ways\n\n2\n\n21 1\n\n2 2 2\n\nQ\nW CV QV\n\nC\n= = = (2.73)\n\nSince electrostatic force is conservative, this work is stored in the form\n\nof potential energy of the system. For the same reason, the final result for\n\npotential energy [Eq. (2.73)] is independent of the manner in which the\n\ncharge configuration of the capacitor is built up. When the capacitor\n\ndischarges, this stored-up energy is released. It is possible to view the\n\npotential energy of the capacitor as ‘stored’ in the electric field between\n\nthe plates. To see this, consider for simplicity, a parallel plate capacitor\n\n[of area A (of each plate) and separation d between the plates].\n\nEnergy stored in the capacitor\n\n= \n\n2 2\n\n0\n\n1 ( )\n\n2 2\n\nQ A d\n\nC A\n\nσ\nε\n\n= × (2.74)\n\nThe surface charge density σ is related to the electric field E between\nthe plates,\n\n0\n\nE\nσ\nε\n\n= (2.75)\n\nFrom Eqs.

(2.77) for the case of a parallel plate capacitor,\nthe result on energy density of an electric field is, in fact, very general and\nholds true for electric field due to any configuration of charges.\n\nExample 2.10 (a) A 900 pF capacitor is charged by 100 V battery\n[Fig. 2.31(a)].

Electrostatic force is a conservative force. Work done by an external\nforce (equal and opposite to the electrostatic force) in bringing a charge\nq from a point R to a point P is q(VP–VR), which is the difference in\npotential energy of charge q between the final and initial points.\n\n2. Potential at a point is the work done per unit charge (by an external\nagency) in bringing a charge from infinity to that point. Potential at a\npoint is arbitrary to within an additive constant, since it is the potential\ndifference between two points which is physically significant. If potential\nat infinity is chosen to be zero; potential at a point with position vector\nr due to a point charge Q placed at the origin is given is given by\n\n1\n( )\n\n4 o\n\nQ\nV\n\nrε\n=\n\nπ\nr\n\n3. The electrostatic potential at a point with position vector r due to a\npoint dipole of dipole moment p placed at the origin is\n\n2\n\nˆ1\n( )\n\n4 ε\n=\n\nπ\np.r\n\nr\no\n\nV\nr\n\nThe result is true also for a dipole (with charges –q and q separated by\n2a)  for r >> a.\n\n4. For a charge configuration q\n1\n, q\n\n2\n, ..., q\n\nn\n with position vectors r\n\n1\n,\n\nr\n2\n, ... r\n\nn\n, the potential at a point P is given by the superposition principle\n\n1 2\n\n0 1P 2P P\n\n1\n( ... )\n\n4\nn\n\nn\n\nqq q\nV\n\nr r rε\n= + + +\n\nπ\n\nwhere r\n1P\n\n is the distance between q\n1\n and P, as and so on.\n\n5. An equipotential surface is a surface over which potential has a constant\nvalue. For a point charge, concentric spheres centred at a location of the\ncharge are equipotential surfaces. The electric field E at a point is\nperpendicular to the equipotential surface through the point. E is in the\ndirection of the steepest decrease of potential.\n\ncharge on each capacitor is then Q ′ = CV ′. By charge\nconservation, Q′  = Q/2. This implies V′  = V/2. The total energy\n\nof the system is 6\n1 1\n\n2 ' ' 2.25 10 J\n2 4\n\nQ V QV\n−= × = = ×\n\nThus in going from (a) to (b), though no charge is lost; the final\nenergy is only half the initial energy. Where has the remaining\nenergy gone?\nThere is a transient period before the system settles to the\nsituation (b). During this period, a transient current flows from\nthe first capacitor to the second. Energy is lost during this time\nin the form of heat and electromagnetic radiation.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n84\n\n6. Potential energy stored in a system of charges is the work done (by an\nexternal agency) in assembling the charges at their locations. Potential\nenergy of two charges q1, q2 at r1, r2 is given by\n\n1 2\n\n0 12\n\n1\n4\n\nq q\nU\n\nrε\n=\n\nπ\n\nwhere r\n12\n\n is distance between q\n1\n and q\n\n2\n.\n\n7. The potential energy of a charge q in an external potential V (r) is qV (r).\nThe potential energy of a dipole moment p in a uniform electric field E  is\n–p.E.\n\n 8. Electrostatics field E is zero in the interior of a conductor; just outside\nthe surface of a charged conductor, E is normal to the surface given by\n\n0\n\nˆ\nσ\nε\n\n=E n  where n̂  is the unit vector along the outward normal to the\n\nsurface and σ is the surface charge density. Charges in a conductor can\nreside only at its surface. Potential is constant within and on the surface\nof a conductor. In a cavity within a conductor (with no charges), the\nelectric field is zero.\n\n9.  A capacitor is a system of two conductors separated by an insulator. Its\ncapacitance is defined by C = Q/V, where Q and –Q are the charges on the\ntwo conductors and V is the potential difference between them. C is\ndetermined purely geometrically, by the shapes, sizes and relative\npositions of the two conductors. The unit of capacitance is farad:,\n1 F = 1 C V –1. For a parallel plate capacitor (with vacuum between the\nplates),\n\nC = 0\nA\n\nd\nε\n\nwhere A is the area of each plate and d the separation between them.\n\n10. If the medium between the plates of a capacitor is filled with an insulating\nsubstance (dielectric), the electric field due to the charged plates induces\na net dipole moment in the dielectric. This effect, called polarisation,\ngives rise to a field in the opposite direction. The net electric field inside\nthe dielectric and hence the potential difference between the plates is\nthus reduced. Consequently, the capacitance C increases from its value\nC0 when there is no medium (vacuum),\n\nC = KC0\n\nwhere K is the dielectric constant of the insulating substance.\n\n11. For capacitors in the series combination, the total capacitance C is given by\n\n1 2 3\n\n1 1 1 1\n...\n\nC C C C\n= + + +\n\nIn the parallel combination, the total capacitance C is:\n\nC =  C1 + C2 + C3 + ...\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectrostatic Potential\n\nand Capacitance\n\n85\n\nPhysical quantity Symbol Dimensions Unit  Remark\n\nPotential  or V [M1 L2 T–3 A–1] V Potential difference is\nphysically significant\n\nCapacitance C [M–1 L–2 T–4 A2] F\n\nPolarisation P [L–2 AT] C m-2 Dipole moment per unit\nvolume\n\nDielectric constant K [Dimensionless]\n\nwhere C1, C2, C3... are individual capacitances.\n\n12.

Electrostatics deals with forces between charges at rest. But if there is a\nforce on a charge, how can it be at rest? Thus, when we are talking of\nelectrostatic force between charges, it should be understood that each\ncharge is being kept at rest by some unspecified force that opposes the\nnet Coulomb force on the charge.\n\n2. A capacitor is so configured that it confines the electric field lines within\na small region of space. Thus, even though field may have considerable\nstrength, the potential difference between the two conductors of a\ncapacitor is small.\n\n3. Electric field is discontinuous across the surface of a spherical charged\nshell. It is zero inside and \n\nσ\nε0\n\nn̂ outside. Electric potential is, however\ncontinuous across the surface, equal to q/4πε\n\n0\nR  at the surface.\n\n4. The torque p × E on a dipole causes it to oscillate about E. Only if there\nis a dissipative mechanism, the oscillations are damped and the dipole\neventually aligns with E.\n\n5. Potential due to a charge q at its own location is not defined – it is\ninfinite.\n\n6. In the expression qV (r) for potential energy of a charge q, V (r) is the\npotential due to external charges and not the potential due to q. As seen\nin point 5, this expression will be ill-defined if V (r) includes potential\ndue to a charge q itself.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n86\n\nEXERCISES\n\n2.1 Two charges 5 × 10–8 C and –3 × 10–8 C are located 16 cm apart.
