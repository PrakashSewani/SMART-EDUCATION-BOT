Have\nyou ever tried to find any explanation for this phenomenon? Another\ncommon example of electric discharge is the lightning that we see in the\nsky during thunderstorms. We also experience a sensation of an electric\nshock either while opening the door of a car or holding the iron bar of a\nbus after sliding from our seat. The reason for these experiences is\ndischarge of electric charges through our body, which were accumulated\ndue to rubbing of insulating surfaces. You might have also heard that\nthis is due to generation of static electricity. This is precisely the topic we\nare going to discuss in this and the next chapter. Static means anything\nthat does not move or change with time. Electrostatics deals with the\nstudy of forces, fields and potentials arising from static charges.\n\n1.2  ELECTRIC CHARGE\nHistorically the credit of discovery of the fact that amber rubbed with\nwool or silk cloth attracts light objects goes to Thales of Miletus, Greece,\naround 600 BC. The name electricity is coined from the Greek word\nelektron meaning amber. Many such pairs of materials were known which\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n2\n\nPhysics\n\non rubbing could attract light objects\nlike straw, pith balls and bits of papers.\nYou can perform the following activity\nat home to experience such an effect.\nCut out long thin strips of white paper\nand lightly iron them. Take them near a\nTV screen or computer monitor. You will\nsee that the strips get attracted to the\nscreen. In fact they remain stuck to the\nscreen for a while.\n\nIt was observed that if two glass rods\nrubbed with wool or silk cloth are\nbrought close to each other, they repel\neach other [Fig. 1.1(a)]. The two strands\nof wool or two pieces of silk cloth, with\nwhich the rods were rubbed, also repel\neach other. However, the glass rod and\n\nwool attracted each other. Similarly, two plastic rods rubbed with cat’s\nfur repelled each other [Fig. 1.1(b)] but attracted the fur. On the other\nhand, the plastic rod attracts the glass rod [Fig. 1.1(c)] and repel the silk\nor wool with which the glass rod is rubbed. The glass rod repels the fur.\n\nIf a plastic rod rubbed with fur is made to touch two small pith balls\n(now-a-days we can use polystyrene balls) suspended by silk or nylon\nthread, then the balls repel each other [Fig. 1.1(d)] and are also repelled\nby the rod. A similar effect is found if the pith balls are touched with a\nglass rod rubbed with silk [Fig. 1.1(e)]. A dramatic observation is that a\npith ball touched with glass rod attracts another pith ball touched with\nplastic rod [Fig. 1.1(f )].\n\nThese seemingly simple facts were established from years of efforts\nand careful experiments and their analyses. It was concluded, after many\ncareful studies by different scientists, that there were only two kinds of\nan entity which is called the electric charge. We say that the bodies like\nglass or plastic rods, silk, fur and pith balls are electrified. They acquire\nan electric charge on rubbing. The experiments on pith balls suggested\nthat there are two kinds of electrification and we find  that (i) like charges\nrepel and (ii) unlike charges attract each other. The experiments also\ndemonstrated that the charges are transferred from the rods to the pith\nballs on  contact. It is said that the pith balls are electrified or are charged\nby  contact. The property which differentiates the two kinds of charges is\ncalled the polarity of charge.\n\nWhen a glass rod is rubbed with silk, the rod acquires one kind of\ncharge and the silk acquires the second kind of charge. This is true for\nany pair of objects that are rubbed to be electrified. Now if the electrified\nglass rod is brought in contact with silk, with which it was rubbed, they\nno longer attract each other. They also do not attract or repel other light\nobjects as they did on being electrified.\n\nThus, the charges acquired after rubbing are lost when the charged\nbodies are brought in contact. What can you conclude from these\nobservations? It just tells us that unlike charges acquired by the objects\n\nFIGURE 1.1 Rods and pith balls: like charges repel and\nunlike charges attract each other.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectric Charges\n\nand Fields\n\n3\n\nneutralise or nullify each other’s effect. Therefore, the charges were named\nas positive and negative by the American scientist Benjamin Franklin.\nWe know that when we add a positive number to a negative number of\nthe same magnitude, the sum is zero. This might have been the\nphilosophy in naming the charges as positive and negative. By convention,\nthe charge on glass rod or cat’s fur is called positive and that on plastic\nrod or silk is termed negative. If an object possesses an electric charge, it\nis said to be electrified or charged. When it has no charge it is said to be\nelectrically neutral.\n\nUNIFICATION OF ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM\n\nIn olden days, electricity and magnetism were treated as separate subjects. Electricity\ndealt with charges on glass rods, cat’s fur, batteries, lightning, etc., while magnetism\ndescribed interactions of magnets, iron filings, compass needles, etc. In 1820 Danish\nscientist Oersted found that a compass needle is deflected by passing an electric current\nthrough a wire placed near the needle. Ampere and Faraday supported this observation\nby saying that electric charges in motion produce magnetic fields and moving magnets\ngenerate electricity. The unification was achieved when the Scottish physicist Maxwell\nand the Dutch physicist Lorentz put forward a theory where they showed the\ninterdependence of these two subjects. This field is called electromagnetism. Most of the\nphenomena occurring around us can be described under electromagnetism. Virtually\nevery force that we can think of like friction, chemical force between atoms holding the\nmatter together, and even the forces describing processes occurring in cells of living\norganisms, have its origin in electromagnetic force. Electromagnetic force is one of the\nfundamental forces of nature.\n\nMaxwell put forth four equations that play the same role in classical electromagnetism\nas Newton’s equations of motion and gravitation law play in mechanics. He also argued\nthat light is electromagnetic in nature and its speed can be found by making purely\nelectric and magnetic measurements. He claimed that the science of optics is intimately\nrelated to that of electricity and magnetism.\n\nThe science of electricity and magnetism is the foundation for the modern technological\ncivilisation. Electric power, telecommunication, radio and television, and a wide variety\nof the practical appliances used in daily life are based on the principles of this science.\nAlthough charged particles in motion exert both electric and magnetic forces, in the\nframe of reference where all the charges are at rest, the forces are purely electrical. You\nknow that gravitational force is a long-range force. Its effect is felt even when the distance\nbetween the interacting particles is very large because the force decreases inversely as\nthe square of the distance between the interacting bodies. We will learn in this chapter\nthat electric force is also as pervasive and is in fact stronger than the gravitational force\nby several orders of magnitude (refer to Chapter 1 of Class XI Physics Textbook).\n\nA simple apparatus to detect charge on a body is the gold-leaf\nelectroscope [Fig. 1.2(a)]. It consists of a vertical metal rod housed in a\nbox, with two thin gold leaves attached to its bottom end. When a charged\nobject touches the metal knob at the top of the rod, charge flows on to\nthe leaves and they diverge. The degree of divergance is an indicator of\nthe amount of charge.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n4\n\nPhysics\n\nStudents can make a simple electroscope as\nfollows [Fig. 1.2(b)]: Take a thin aluminium curtain\nrod with ball ends fitted for hanging the curtain. Cut\nout a piece of length about 20 cm with the ball at\none end and flatten the cut end. Take a large bottle\nthat can hold this rod and a cork which will fit in the\nopening of the bottle. Make a hole in the cork\nsufficient to hold the curtain rod snugly. Slide the\nrod through the hole in the cork with the cut end on\nthe lower side and ball end projecting above the cork.\nFold a small, thin aluminium foil (about 6 cm in\nlength) in the middle and attach it to the flattened\nend of the rod by cellulose tape. This forms the leaves\nof your electroscope. Fit the cork in the bottle with\nabout 5 cm of the ball end projecting above the cork.\nA paper scale may be put inside the bottle in advance\nto measure the separation of leaves. The separation\nis a rough measure of the amount of charge on the\nelectroscope.\n\nTo understand how the electroscope works, use\nthe white paper strips we used for seeing the\nattraction of charged bodies. Fold the strips into half\nso that you make a mark of fold. Open the strip and\niron it lightly with the mountain fold up, as shown\nin Fig. 1.3. Hold the strip by pinching it at the fold.\nYou would notice that the two halves move apart.\n\nThis shows that the strip has acquired charge on ironing. When you fold\nit into half, both the halves have the same charge. Hence they repel each\nother. The same effect is seen in the leaf electroscope. On charging the\ncurtain rod by touching the ball end with an electrified body, charge is\ntransferred to the curtain rod and the attached aluminium foil. Both the\nhalves of the foil get similar charge and therefore repel each other. The\ndivergence in the leaves depends on the amount of charge on them. Let\nus first try to understand why material bodies acquire charge.\n\nYou know that all matter is made up of atoms and/or molecules.\nAlthough normally the materials are electrically neutral,  they do contain\ncharges; but their charges are exactly balanced. Forces that hold the\nmolecules together, forces that hold atoms together in a solid, the adhesive\nforce of glue, forces associated with surface tension, all are basically\nelectrical in nature, arising from the forces between charged particles.\nThus the electric force is all pervasive and it encompasses almost each\nand every field associated with our life. It is therefore  essential that we\nlearn more about such a force.\n\nTo electrify a neutral body, we need to add or remove one kind of\ncharge. When we say that a body is charged, we always refer to this\nexcess charge or deficit of charge. In solids,  some of the electrons, being\nless tightly bound in the atom, are the charges which are transferred\nfrom one body to the other.  A body can thus be charged positively by\nlosing some of its electrons. Similarly, a body can be charged negatively\n\nFIGURE 1.2 Electroscopes: (a) The gold leaf\nelectroscope, (b) Schematics of a simple\n\nelectroscope.\n\nFIGURE 1.3 Paper strip\nexperiment.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectric Charges\n\nand Fields\n\n5\n\nby gaining electrons. When we rub a glass rod with silk, some of the\nelectrons from the rod are transferred to the silk cloth. Thus the rod gets\npositively charged and the silk gets negatively charged. No new charge is\ncreated in the process of rubbing. Also the number of electrons, that are\ntransferred, is a very small fraction of the total number of electrons in the\nmaterial body. Also only the less tightly bound electrons in a material\nbody can be transferred from it to another by rubbing. Therefore, when\na body is rubbed with another, the bodies get charged and that is why\nwe have to stick to certain pairs of materials to notice charging on rubbing\nthe bodies.\n\n1.3  CONDUCTORS AND INSULATORS\nA metal rod held in hand and rubbed with wool will not show any sign of\nbeing charged. However, if a metal rod with a wooden or plastic handle is\nrubbed without touching its metal part, it shows signs of charging.\nSuppose we connect one end of a copper wire to a neutral pith ball and\nthe other end to a negatively charged plastic rod. We will find that the\npith ball acquires a negative charge. If a similar experiment is repeated\nwith a nylon thread or a rubber band, no transfer of charge will take\nplace from the plastic rod to the pith ball. Why does the transfer of charge\nnot take place from the rod to the ball?\n\nSome substances readily allow passage of electricity through them,\nothers do not.  Those which allow electricity to pass through them easily\nare called conductors. They have electric charges (electrons) that are\ncomparatively free to move inside the material. Metals, human and animal\nbodies and earth are conductors. Most of the non-metals like glass,\nporcelain, plastic, nylon, wood offer high resistance to the passage of\nelectricity through them. They are called insulators. Most  substances\nfall into one of the two classes stated above*.\n\nWhen some charge is transferred to a conductor, it readily gets\ndistributed over the entire surface of the conductor. In contrast, if some\ncharge is put on an insulator, it stays at the same place. You will learn\nwhy this happens in the next chapter.\n\nThis property of the materials tells you why a nylon or plastic comb\ngets electrified on combing dry hair or on rubbing, but a metal article\nlike spoon does not. The charges on metal leak through our body to the\nground as both are conductors of electricity.\n\n  When we bring a charged body  in contact with the earth,  all the\nexcess charge on the body disappears by causing a momentary current\nto pass to the ground through the connecting conductor (such as our\nbody). This process of sharing the charges with the earth is called\ngrounding or earthing. Earthing provides a safety measure for electrical\ncircuits and appliances. A thick metal plate is buried deep into the earth\nand thick wires are drawn from this plate; these are  used in buildings\nfor the purpose of earthing near the mains supply.  The electric wiring in\nour houses has three wires: live, neutral and earth. The first two carry\n\n* There is a third category called semiconductors, which offer resistance to the\nmovement of charges which is intermediate between the conductors and\ninsulators.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n6\n\nPhysics\n\nelectric current from the power station and the third is earthed by\nconnecting it to the buried metal plate. Metallic bodies of the electric\nappliances such as electric iron, refrigerator, TV are connected to the\nearth wire. When any fault occurs or live wire touches the metallic body,\nthe charge flows to the earth without damaging the appliance and without\ncausing any injury to the humans; this  would have otherwise been\nunavoidable since  the human body is a  conductor of electricity.\n\n1.4  CHARGING BY INDUCTION\nWhen we touch a pith ball with an electrified plastic rod, some of the\nnegative charges on the rod are transferred to the pith ball and it also\ngets charged. Thus the pith ball is charged by contact. It is then repelled\nby the plastic rod but is attracted by a glass rod which is oppositely\ncharged. However, why a electrified rod attracts light objects, is  a  question\nwe have still left unanswered. Let us try to understand what could be\nhappening by performing the following experiment.\n(i) Bring two metal spheres, A and B, supported on insulating stands,\n\nin contact as shown in Fig. 1.4(a).\n(ii) Bring a positively charged rod near one of the spheres, say A, taking\n\ncare that it does not touch the sphere. The free electrons in the spheres\nare attracted towards the rod. This leaves an excess of positive charge\non the rear surface of sphere B. Both kinds of charges are bound in\nthe metal spheres and cannot escape. They, therefore, reside on the\nsurfaces, as shown in Fig. 1.4(b). The left surface of sphere A, has an\nexcess of negative charge and the right surface of sphere B, has an\nexcess of positive charge. However, not all of the electrons in the spheres\nhave accumulated on the left surface of A. As the negative charge\nstarts building up at the left surface of A, other electrons are repelled\nby these. In a short time, equilibrium is reached under the action of\nforce of attraction of the rod and the force of repulsion due to the\naccumulated charges. Fig. 1.4(b) shows the equilibrium situation.\nThe process is called induction of charge and happens almost\ninstantly. The accumulated charges remain on the surface, as shown,\ntill the glass rod is held near the sphere. If the rod is removed, the\ncharges are not acted by any outside force and they redistribute to\ntheir original neutral state.\n\n(iii) Separate the spheres by a small distance while the glass rod is still\nheld near sphere A, as shown in Fig. 1.4(c). The two spheres are found\nto be oppositely charged and attract each other.\n\n(iv) Remove the rod. The charges on spheres rearrange themselves as\nshown in Fig. 1.4(d). Now, separate the spheres quite apart. The\ncharges on them get uniformly distributed over them, as shown in\nFig. 1.4(e).\nIn this process, the metal spheres will each be equal and oppositely\n\ncharged. This is charging by induction. The positively charged glass rod\ndoes not lose any of its charge, contrary to the process of charging by\ncontact.\n\nWhen electrified rods are brought near light objects, a similar effect\ntakes place. The rods induce opposite charges on the near surfaces of\nthe objects and similar charges move to the farther side of the object.\n\nFIGURE 1.4 Charging\nby induction.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectric Charges\n\nand Fields\n\n7\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n.1\n\n[This happens even when the light object is not a conductor. The\nmechanism for how this happens is explained later in Sections 1.10 and\n2.10.] The centres of the two types of charges are slightly separated. We\nknow that opposite charges attract while similar charges repel. However,\nthe magnitude of force depends on the distance between the charges\nand in this case the force of attraction overweighs the force of repulsion.\nAs a result the particles like bits of paper or pith balls, being light, are\npulled towards the rods.\n\nExample 1.1 How can you charge a metal sphere positively without\ntouching it?\n\nSolution Figure 1.5(a) shows an uncharged metallic sphere on an\ninsulating metal stand. Bring a negatively charged rod close to the\nmetallic sphere, as shown in Fig. 1.5(b). As the rod is brought close\nto the sphere, the free electrons in the sphere move away due to\nrepulsion and start piling up at the farther end. The near end becomes\npositively charged due to deficit of electrons. This process of charge\ndistribution stops when the net force on the free electrons inside the\nmetal is zero. Connect the sphere to the ground by a conducting\nwire. The electrons will flow to the ground while the positive charges\nat the near end will remain held there due to the attractive force of\nthe negative charges on the rod, as shown in Fig. 1.5(c). Disconnect\nthe sphere from the ground. The positive charge continues to be\nheld at the near end [Fig. 1.5(d)]. Remove the electrified rod. The\npositive charge will spread uniformly over the sphere as shown in\nFig. 1.5(e).\n\nFIGURE 1.5\n\nIn this experiment, the metal sphere gets charged by the process\nof induction and the rod does not lose any of its charge.\n\nSimilar steps are involved in charging a metal sphere negatively\nby induction, by bringing a positively charged rod near it. In this\ncase the electrons will flow from the ground to the sphere when the\nsphere is connected to the ground with a wire.

Here,  we shall now\ndescribe some other properties of the electric charge.\n\nIf the sizes of charged bodies are very small as compared to the\ndistances between them, we treat them as point charges. All the\ncharge content of the body is assumed to be concentrated at one point\nin space.\n\n1.5.1  Additivity of charges\n\nWe have not as yet given a quantitative definition of a charge; we shall\nfollow it up in the next section. We shall tentatively assume that this can\nbe done and proceed. If a system contains two point charges q\n\n1\n and q\n\n2\n,\n\nthe total charge of the system is obtained simply by adding algebraically\nq\n\n1\n and q\n\n2 \n,\n \ni.e., charges add up like real numbers or they are scalars like\n\nthe mass of a body. If a system contains n charges q1, q2, q3, …, qn, then\nthe total charge of the system is q\n\n1\n + q\n\n2\n + q\n\n3\n + … + q\n\nn \n.  Charge has\n\nmagnitude but no direction, similar to mass. However, there is one\ndifference between mass and charge. Mass of a body is always positive\nwhereas a charge can be either positive or negative. Proper signs have to\nbe used while adding the charges in a system. For example, the\ntotal charge of a system containing five charges +1, +2, –3, +4 and –5,\nin some arbitrary unit, is (+1) + (+2) + (–3) + (+4) + (–5) = –1 in the\nsame unit.\n\n1.5.2  Charge is conserved\n\nWe have already  hinted to the fact that when bodies are charged by\nrubbing, there is transfer of electrons from one body to the other; no new\ncharges are either created or destroyed. A picture of particles of electric\ncharge enables us to understand the idea of conservation of charge. When\nwe rub two bodies, what one body gains in charge the other body loses.\nWithin an isolated system consisting of many charged bodies, due to\ninteractions among the bodies, charges may get redistributed but it is\nfound that the total charge of the isolated system is always conserved.\nConservation of charge has been established experimentally.\n\nIt is not possible to create or destroy net charge carried by any isolated\nsystem although the charge carrying particles may be created or destroyed\nin a process. Sometimes nature creates charged particles: a neutron turns\ninto a proton and an electron. The proton and electron thus created have\nequal and opposite charges and the total charge is zero before and after\nthe creation.\n\n1.5.3  Quantisation of charge\n\nExperimentally it is established that all free charges are integral multiples\nof a basic unit of charge denoted by e. Thus charge q on a body is always\ngiven by\n\nq = ne\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectric Charges\n\nand Fields\n\n9\n\nwhere n is any integer, positive or negative. This basic unit of charge is the\ncharge that an electron or proton carries. By convention, the charge on an\nelectron is taken to be negative; therefore charge on an electron is written\nas –e and that on a proton as +e.\n\nThe fact that electric charge is always an integral multiple of e is termed\nas quantisation of charge. There are a large number of situations in physics\nwhere certain physical quantities are quantised. The quantisation of charge\nwas first suggested by the experimental laws of electrolysis discovered by\nEnglish experimentalist Faraday. It was experimentally demonstrated by\nMillikan in 1912.\n\nIn the International System (SI) of Units, a unit of charge is called a\ncoulomb and is denoted by the symbol C. A coulomb is defined in terms\nthe unit of the electric current which you are going to learn in a subsequent\nchapter. In terms of this definition, one coulomb is the charge flowing\nthrough a wire in 1 s if the current is 1 A (ampere), (see Chapter 2 of Class\nXI, Physics Textbook , Part I). In this system, the value of the basic unit of\ncharge is\n\ne = 1.602192 × 10–19 C\n\nThus, there are about 6 × 1018 electrons in a charge of  –1C. In\nelectrostatics, charges of this large magnitude are seldom encountered\nand hence we use smaller units 1 µC (micro coulomb) = 10–6 C or 1 mC\n(milli coulomb) = 10–3 C.\n\nIf the protons and electrons are the only basic charges in the universe,\nall the observable charges have to be integral multiples of e. Thus, if a\nbody contains n\n\n1\n electrons and n\n\n2\n protons, the total amount of charge on\n\nthe body is n\n2\n × e + n\n\n1\n × (–e) = (n\n\n2\n – n\n\n1\n) e. Since n\n\n1\n and n\n\n2\n are integers, their\n\ndifference is also an integer. Thus the charge on any body is always an\nintegral multiple of e and can be increased or decreased also in steps of e.\n\nThe step size e is, however, very small because at the macroscopic\nlevel, we deal with charges of a few µC. At this scale the fact that charge of\na body can increase or decrease in units of e is not visible. In this respect,\nthe grainy nature of the charge is lost and it appears to be continuous.\n\nThis situation can be compared with the geometrical concepts of points\nand lines. A dotted line viewed from a distance appears continuous to\nus but is not continuous in reality. As many points very close to\neach other normally give an impression of a continuous line, many\nsmall charges taken together appear as a continuous charge\ndistribution.\n\nAt the macroscopic level, one deals with charges that are enormous\ncompared to the magnitude of charge e. Since e = 1.6 × 10–19 C, a charge\nof magnitude, say 1 µC, contains something like 1013 times the electronic\ncharge. At this scale, the fact that charge can increase or decrease only in\nunits of e is not very different from saying that charge can take continuous\nvalues. Thus, at the macroscopic level, the quantisation of charge has no\npractical consequence and can be ignored. However, at the microscopic\nlevel, where the charges involved are of the order of a few tens or hundreds\nof e, i.e., they can be counted, they appear in discrete lumps and\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n10\n\nPhysics\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n.3\n E\n\nX\nA\n\nM\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n.2\n\nquantisation of charge cannot be ignored. It is the magnitude of scale\ninvolved that is very important.\n\nExample 1.2 If 109 electrons move out of a body to another body\nevery second, how much time is required to get a total charge of 1 C\non the other body?\n\nSolution In one second 109 electrons move out of the body. Therefore\nthe charge given out in one second is 1.6 × 10–19 × 109 C = 1.6 × 10–10 C.\nThe time required to accumulate a charge of 1 C can then be estimated\nto be 1 C ÷ (1.6 × 10–10 C/s) = 6.25 × 109 s = 6.25 × 109 ÷ (365  × 24 ×\n3600) years = 198 years. Thus to collect a charge of one coulomb,\nfrom a body from which 109 electrons move out every second, we will\nneed approximately 200 years. One coulomb is, therefore, a very large\nunit for many practical purposes.\nIt is, however, also important to know what is roughly the number of\nelectrons contained in a piece of one cubic centimetre of a material.\nA cubic piece of copper of side 1 cm contains about 2.5 × 1024\n\nelectrons.\n\nExample 1.3 How much positive and negative charge is there in a\ncup of water?\n\nSolution Let us assume that the mass of one cup of water is\n250 g. The molecular mass of water is 18g. Thus, one mole\n(= 6.02 × 1023 molecules) of water is 18 g. Therefore the number of\nmolecules in one cup of water is (250/18) × 6.02 × 1023.\nEach molecule of water contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen\natom, i.e., 10 electrons and 10 protons. Hence the total positive and\ntotal negative charge has the same magnitude. It is equal to\n(250/18) × 6.02 × 1023 × 10 × 1.6 × 10–19 C = 1.34 × 107 C.\n\n1.6  COULOMB’S LAW\nCoulomb’s law is a quantitative statement about the force between two\npoint charges. When the linear size of charged bodies are much smaller\nthan the distance separating them, the size may be ignored and the\ncharged bodies are treated as point charges. Coulomb measured the\nforce between two point charges and found that it varied inversely as\nthe square of the distance between the charges and was directly\n\nproportional to the product of the magnitude of the two charges and\n\nacted along the line joining the two charges. Thus, if two point charges\nq1, q2 are separated by a distance r in vacuum, the magnitude of the\nforce (F) between them is given by\n\n21\n2\n\nq q\nF k\n\nr\n= (1.1)\n\nHow did Coulomb arrive at this law from his experiments? Coulomb\nused a torsion balance*  for measuring the force between two charged metallic\n\n* A torsion balance is a sensitive device to measure force. It was also used later\nby Cavendish to measure the very feeble gravitational force between two objects,\nto verify Newton’s Law of Gravitation.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectric Charges\n\nand Fields\n\n11\n\nspheres. When the separation between two spheres is much\nlarger than the radius of each sphere, the charged spheres\nmay be regarded as point charges. However, the charges\non the spheres were unknown, to begin with. How then\ncould he discover a relation like Eq. (1.1)? Coulomb\nthought of the following simple way: Suppose the charge\non a metallic sphere is q. If the sphere is put in contact\nwith an identical uncharged sphere, the charge will spread\nover the two spheres. By symmetry, the charge on each\nsphere will be q/2*. Repeating this process, we can get\ncharges q/2, q/4, etc. Coulomb varied the distance for a\nfixed pair of charges and measured the force for different\nseparations. He then varied the charges in pairs, keeping\nthe distance fixed for each pair. Comparing forces for\ndifferent pairs of charges at different distances, Coulomb\narrived at the relation, Eq. (1.1).\n\nCoulomb’s law, a simple mathematical statement,\nwas initially experimentally arrived at  in the manner\ndescribed above. While the original experiments\nestablished it at a macroscopic scale, it has also been\nestablished down to subatomic level  (r ~ 10–10 m).\n\nCoulomb discovered his law without knowing the\nexplicit magnitude of the charge. In fact, it is the other\nway round: Coulomb’s law can now be employed to\nfurnish a definition for a unit of charge. In the relation,\nEq. (1.1), k is so far arbitrary. We can choose any positive\nvalue of k. The choice of k determines the size of the unit\nof charge. In SI units, the value of k is about 9 × 109\n\n2\n\n2\n\nNm\nC\n\n. The unit of charge that results from this choice is\n\ncalled a coulomb which we defined earlier in Section\n1.4. Putting this value of k in Eq. (1.1), we see that for\nq1 = q2 = 1 C, r = 1 m\n\nF = 9 × 109 N\nThat is, 1 C is the charge that when placed at a\n\ndistance of 1 m from another charge of the same\nmagnitude in vacuum experiences an electrical force of\nrepulsion of magnitude 9 × 109 N. One coulomb is\nevidently too big a unit to be used. In practice, in\nelectrostatics, one uses smaller units like 1 mC or 1 µC.\n\nThe constant k in Eq. (1.1) is usually put as\nk = 1/4πε\n\n0\n for later convenience, so that Coulomb’s law is written as\n\n0\n\n1 2\n2\n\n1\n4\n\nq q\nF\n\nrε\n=\n\nπ\n(1.2)\n\nε0 is called the permittivity of free space . The value of ε0 in SI units is\n\n0\nε = 8.854 × 10–12 C2 N–1m–2\n\n* Implicit in this is the assumption of additivity of charges and conservation:\ntwo charges (q/2 each) add up to make a total charge q.\n\nCharles Augustin de\nCoulomb (1736 – 1806)\n\nCoulomb, a French\nphysicist, began his career\nas a military engineer in\nthe West Indies. In 1776, he\nreturned to Paris and\nretired to a small estate to\ndo his scientific research.\nHe invented a torsion\nbalance to measure the\nquantity of a force and used\nit for determination of\nforces of electric attraction\nor repulsion between small\ncharged spheres. He thus\narrived in 1785 at the\ninverse square law relation,\nnow known as Coulomb’s\nlaw. The law had been\nanticipated by Priestley and\nalso by Cavendish earlier,\nthough Cavendish never\npublished his results.\nCoulomb also found the\ninverse square law of force\nbetween unlike and like\nmagnetic poles.\n\nC\nH\n\nA\nR\n\nL\nE\n\nS\n A\n\nU\nG\n\nU\nS\n\nT\nIN\n\n D\nE\n\n C\nO\n\nU\nL\nO\n\nM\nB\n\n  (1\n7\n3\n6\n –1\n\n8\n0\n6\n)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n12\n\nPhysics\n\nSince force is a vector, it is better to write\nCoulomb’s law in the vector notation. Let the\nposition vectors of charges q\n\n1\n and q\n\n2\n be r\n\n1\n and r\n\n2\nrespectively [see Fig.1.6(a)]. We denote force on\nq\n\n1\n due to q\n\n2\n by F\n\n12\n and force on q\n\n2\n due to q\n\n1\n by\n\nF\n21\n\n. The two point charges q\n1\n and q\n\n2\n have been\n\nnumbered 1 and 2 for convenience and the vector\nleading from 1 to 2 is denoted by r\n\n21\n:\n\nr\n21\n\n = r\n2\n – r\n\n1\n\nIn the same way, the vector leading from 2 to\n1 is denoted by r\n\n12\n:\n\nr\n12\n\n = r\n1\n – r\n\n2\n = – r\n\n21\n\nThe magnitude of the vectors r\n21\n\n and r\n12\n\n is\ndenoted by r\n\n21 \nand r\n\n12\n,\n \nrespectively (r\n\n12 \n= r\n\n21\n). The\n\ndirection of a vector is specified by a unit vector\nalong the vector. To denote the direction from 1\nto 2 (or from 2 to 1), we define the unit vectors:\n\n$ 21\n21\n\n21\n\n=\nr\n\nr\nr\n\n, \n$ $ $12\n12 21 12\n\n12\n\n,= −\nr\n\nr r r\nr\n\nCoulomb’s force law between two point charges q1 and q2 located at\nr1 and r2, respectively is then expressed as\n\n$1 2\n2121 2\n\n21\n\n1\n4 ε\n\n=\nπ\n\nF r\no\n\nq q\n\nr\n(1.3)\n\nSome remarks on Eq. (1.3) are relevant:\n\n• Equation (1.3) is valid for any sign of q\n1\n and q\n\n2\n whether positive or\n\nnegative. If q1 and q2 are of the same sign (either both positive or both\nnegative), F21 is along r̂ 21, which denotes repulsion, as it should be for\n\nlike charges. If q\n1\n and q\n\n2\n are of opposite signs, F\n\n21\n is along – $r 21(= $r 12),\n\nwhich denotes attraction, as expected for unlike charges. Thus, we do\nnot have to write separate equations for the cases of like and unlike\ncharges. Equation (1.3) takes care of both cases correctly [Fig. 1.6(b)].\n\n• The force F\n12\n\n  on charge q\n1\n due to charge q\n\n2\n, is obtained from Eq. (1.3),\n\nby simply interchanging 1 and 2, i.e.,\n\n1 2\n12 12 212\n\n0 12\n\n1\nˆ\n\n4 ε\n= = −\n\nπ\nF r F\n\nq q\n\nr\n\nThus, Coulomb’s law agrees with the Newton’s third law.\n\n• Coulomb’s law [Eq. (1.3)] gives the force between two charges q\n1\n and\n\nq2 in vacuum. If the charges are placed in matter or the intervening\nspace has matter, the situation gets complicated due to the presence\nof charged constituents of matter. We shall consider electrostatics in\nmatter in the next chapter.\n\nFIGURE 1.6 (a) Geometry and\n(b) Forces between charges.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectric Charges\n\nand Fields\n\n13\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n.4\n\nExample 1.4 Coulomb’s law for electrostatic force between two point\ncharges and Newton’s law for gravitational force between two\nstationary point masses, both have inverse-square dependence on\nthe distance between the charges and masses respectively.\n(a) Compare the strength of these forces by determining the ratio of\ntheir magnitudes (i) for an electron and a proton and (ii) for two\nprotons.

How to calculate the force on a\ncharge where there are not one but several charges\naround? Consider a system of n stationary charges\nq1, q2, q3, ..., qn in vacuum. What is the force on q1 due\nto q\n\n2\n, q\n\n3\n, ..., q\n\nn\n? Coulomb’s law is not enough to answer\n\nthis question.  Recall that forces of mechanical origin\nadd according to the parallelogram law of addition. Is\nthe same true for forces of electrostatic origin?\n\nExperimentally, it is verified that force on any\ncharge due to a number of other charges is the vector\nsum of all the forces on that charge due to the other\ncharges, taken one at a time. The individual forces\n\nare unaffected due to the presence of other charges.\nThis is termed as the principle of superposition.\n\nTo better understand the concept, consider a\nsystem of three charges q1, q2 and q3, as shown in\nFig. 1.8(a). The force on one charge, say q\n\n1\n, due to two\n\nother charges q\n2\n, q\n\n3\n can therefore be obtained by\n\nperforming a vector addition of the forces due to each\none of these charges. Thus, if the force on q\n\n1\n due to q\n\n2\nis denoted by F\n\n12\n, F\n\n12\n is given by Eq. (1.3)  even though\n\nother charges are present.\n\nThus, F12 =\n1\n\n4 0\n1 2\n\n12\n2 12\n\nπε\n\nq q\n\nr\nr̂\n\nIn the same way, the force on q1 due to q3, denoted\nby F\n\n13\n, is given by\n\nF r13\n0\n\n1 3\n\n13\n2 13\n\n1\n4\n\n=\nπε\n\nq q\n\nr\nˆ\n\nFIGURE 1.8 A system of (a) three\ncharges (b) multiple charges.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n16\n\nPhysics\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n.6\n\nwhich again is the Coulomb force on q\n1\n due to q\n\n3\n, even though other\n\ncharge q\n2\n is present.\n\nThus the total force F1 on q1 due to the two charges q2 and q3 is\ngiven as\n\nF F F r r1 12 13\n0\n\n1 2\n\n12\n2 12\n\n0\n\n1 3\n\n13\n2 13\n\n1\n4\n\n1\n4\n\n= + = +\nπ πε ε\n\nq q\n\nr\n\nq q\n\nr\nˆ ˆ (1.4)\n\nThe above calculation of force can be generalised to a system of\ncharges more than three, as shown in Fig. 1.8(b).\n\nThe principle of superposition says that in a system of charges q1,\nq\n\n2\n, ..., q\n\nn\n, the force on q\n\n1\n due to q\n\n2\n is the same as given by Coulomb’s law,\n\ni.e., it is unaffected by the presence of the other charges q\n3\n, q\n\n4\n, ..., q\n\nn\n.

It follows straight from the fact\nthat Coulomb’s law is consistent with Newton’s third law. The proof\nis left to you as an exercise.\n\n1.8  ELECTRIC FIELD\nLet us consider a point charge Q placed in vacuum, at the origin O. If we\nplace another point charge q at a point P, where OP = r, then the charge Q\nwill exert a force on q as per Coulomb’s law. We may ask the question: If\ncharge q is removed, then what is left in the surrounding? Is there\nnothing? If there is nothing at the point P, then how does a force act\nwhen we place the charge q at P. In order to answer such questions, the\nearly scientists introduced the concept of field. According to this, we say\nthat the charge Q produces an electric field everywhere in the surrounding.\nWhen another charge q is brought at some point P, the field there acts on\nit and produces a force. The electric field produced by the charge Q  at a\npoint r is given as\n\nE r r r( ) = =\n1\n\n4\n1\n\n40\n2\n\n0\n2\n\nπ πε ε\n\nQ\n\nr\n\nQ\n\nr\nˆ ˆ (1.6)\n\nwhere ˆ =r  r/r, is a unit vector from the origin to the point r. Thus, Eq.(1.6)\nspecifies the value of the electric field for each value of the position\nvector r. The word “field” signifies how some distributed quantity (which\ncould be a scalar or a vector) varies with position. The effect of the charge\nhas been incorporated in the existence of the electric field. We obtain the\nforce F\n\n \nexerted by a\n\n \ncharge Q on a charge q, as\n\nF r=\n1\n\n4 0\n2\n\nπε\n\nQq\n\nr\nˆ (1.7)\n\nNote that the charge q also exerts an equal and opposite force on the\ncharge Q. The electrostatic force between the charges Q and q can be\nlooked upon as an interaction between charge q and the electric field of\nQ and vice versa. If we denote the position of charge q by the vector r, it\nexperiences a force F equal to the charge q multiplied by the electric\nfield E at the location of q. Thus,\n\nF(r) = q E(r) (1.8)\nEquation (1.8) defines the SI unit of electric field as N/C*.\nSome important remarks may be made here:\n\n(i) From Eq. (1.8), we can infer that if q is unity, the electric field due to\na charge Q is numerically equal to the force exerted by it. Thus, the\nelectric field due to a charge Q at a point in space may be defined\nas the force that a unit positive charge would experience if placed\n\n* An alternate unit V/m will be introduced in the next chapter.\n\nFIGURE 1.11 Electric\nfield (a) due to a\n\ncharge Q, (b) due to a\ncharge –Q.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectric Charges\n\nand Fields\n\n19\n\nat that point. The charge Q, which is producing the electric field, is\ncalled a source charge and the charge q, which tests the effect of a\nsource charge, is called a test charge. Note that the source charge Q\nmust remain at its original location. However, if a charge q is brought\nat any point around Q, Q itself is bound to experience an electrical\nforce due to q and will tend to move. A way out of this difficulty is to\nmake q negligibly small. The force F is then negligibly small but the\nratio F/q is finite and defines the electric field:\n\nE\nF\n\n=\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8\uf8f7→\nlim\nq q0\n\n(1.9)\n\nA practical way to get around the problem (of keeping Q undisturbed\nin the presence of q) is to hold Q to its location by unspecified forces!\nThis may look strange but actually this is what happens in practice.\nWhen we are considering the electric force on a test charge q due to a\ncharged planar sheet (Section 1.15), the charges on the sheet are held to\ntheir locations by the forces due to the unspecified charged constituents\ninside the sheet.\n(ii) Note that the electric field E due to Q, though defined operationally\n\nin terms of some test charge q, is independent of q. This is because\nF is proportional to q, so the ratio F/q does not depend on q. The\nforce F on the charge q due to the charge Q depends on the particular\nlocation of charge q which may take any value in the space around\nthe charge Q. Thus, the electric field E due to Q is also dependent on\nthe space coordinate r. For different positions of the charge q all over\nthe space, we get different values of electric field E. The field exists at\nevery point in three-dimensional space.\n\n(iii) For a positive charge, the electric field will be directed radially\noutwards from the charge. On the other hand, if the source charge is\nnegative, the electric field vector, at each point, points radially inwards.\n\n(iv) Since the magnitude of the force F on charge q due to charge Q\ndepends only on the distance r of the charge q from charge Q,\nthe magnitude of the electric field E will also depend only on the\ndistance r. Thus at equal distances from the charge Q, the magnitude\nof its electric field E is same. The magnitude of electric field E due to\na point charge is thus same on a sphere with the point charge at its\ncentre; in other words, it has a spherical symmetry.\n\n1.8.1  Electric field due to a system of charges\n\nConsider a system of charges q\n1\n, q\n\n2\n, ..., q\n\nn\n with  position vectors r\n\n1\n,\n\nr\n2\n, ..., r\n\nn\n relative  to some origin O. Like the electric field at a point in\n\nspace due to a single charge, electric field at a point in space due to the\nsystem of charges is defined to be the force experienced by a unit\ntest charge placed at that point, without disturbing the original\npositions of charges q\n\n1\n, q\n\n2\n, ..., q\n\nn\n. We can use Coulomb’s law and the\n\nsuperposition principle to determine this field at a point P denoted by\nposition vector r.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n20\n\nPhysics\n\nElectric field E\n1\n at r due to q\n\n1\n at r\n\n1\n is given by\n\nE1 = \n1\n\n4\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\nπε\n\nq\n\nr\nP\n\n1P\nr̂\n\nwhere 1Pr̂  is a unit vector in the direction from q1 to P,\nand r\n\n1P\n is the distance between q\n\n1\n and P.\n\nIn the same manner, electric field E2 at r due to q2 at\nr2 is\n\nE\n2\n = \n\n1\n4\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\nπε\n\nq\n\nr\nP\n\n2P\nr̂\n\nwhere 2Pr̂  is a unit vector in the direction from q2 to P\nand r\n\n2P\n is the distance between q\n\n2\n and P. Similar\n\nexpressions hold good for fields E\n3\n, E\n\n4\n, ..., E\n\nn\n due to\n\ncharges q3, q4, ..., qn.\nBy the superposition principle, the electric field E at r\ndue to the system of charges is (as shown in Fig. 1.12)\n\nE(r)  =  E1 (r) +  E2 (r)  + …  +  En(r)\n\n        =\n1\n\n4\n1\n\n4\n1\n\n40\n1\n\n1\n2 1\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2\n2 2\n\n0\n2\n\nπ π πε ε ε\n\nq\n\nr\n\nq\n\nr\n\nq\n\nr\n\nn\n\nn\n\nn\n\nP\nP\n\nP\nP\n\nP\nPˆ ˆ ... ˆr r r+ + +\n\nE(r) =\n=\n\n∑ \n1\n\n4 0 P\ni P\n\nπε\n\nq\n\nr\n\ni\n\nii\n\nn\n\n2\n1\n\nr̂ (1.10)\n\nE is a vector quantity that varies from one point to another point in space\nand is determined from the positions of the source charges.\n\n1.8.2  Physical significance of electric field\n\nYou may wonder why the notion of electric field has been introduced\nhere at all. After all, for any system of charges, the measurable quantity\nis the force on a charge which can be directly determined using Coulomb’s\nlaw and the superposition principle [Eq. (1.5)]. Why then introduce this\nintermediate quantity called the electric field?\n\nFor electrostatics, the concept of electric field is convenient, but not\nreally necessary. Electric field is an elegant way of characterising the\nelectrical environment of a system of charges. Electric field at a point in\nthe space around a system of charges tells you the force a unit positive\ntest charge would experience if placed at that point (without disturbing\nthe system). Electric field is a characteristic of the system of charges and\nis independent of the test charge that you place at a point to determine\nthe field. The term field in physics generally refers to a quantity that is\ndefined at every point in space and may vary from point to point. Electric\nfield is a vector field, since force is a vector quantity.\n\nThe true physical significance of the concept of electric field, however,\nemerges only when we go beyond electrostatics and deal with time-\ndependent electromagnetic phenomena. Suppose we consider the force\nbetween two distant charges q1, q2 in accelerated motion. Now the greatest\nspeed with which a signal or information can go from one point to another\nis c, the speed of light. Thus, the effect of any motion of q\n\n1\n on q\n\n2\n cannot\n\nFIGURE 1.12 Electric field at a\npoint due to a system of charges is\nthe vector sum of the electric fields\n\nat the point due to individual\ncharges.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectric Charges\n\nand Fields\n\n21\n\narise instantaneously. There will be some time delay between the effect\n(force on q\n\n2\n) and the cause (motion of q\n\n1\n). It is precisely here that the\n\nnotion of electric field (strictly, electromagnetic field) is natural and very\nuseful. The field picture is this: the accelerated motion of charge q\n\n1\nproduces electromagnetic waves, which then propagate with the speed\n\nc, reach q2 and cause a force on q2. The notion of field elegantly accounts\nfor the time delay. Thus, even though electric and magnetic fields can be\ndetected only by their effects (forces) on charges, they are regarded as\nphysical entities, not merely mathematical constructs. They have an\nindependent dynamics of their own,  i.e., they evolve according to laws\nof their own. They can also transport energy. Thus, a source of time-\ndependent electromagnetic fields, turned on for a short interval of time\nand then switched off, leaves behind propagating electromagnetic fields\ntransporting energy. The concept of field was first introduced by Faraday\nand is now among the central concepts in physics.\n\nExample 1.8 An electron falls through a distance of 1.5 cm in a\nuniform electric field of magnitude 2.0 × 104 N C–1 [Fig. 1.13(a)]. The\ndirection of the field is reversed keeping its magnitude unchanged\nand a proton falls through the same distance [Fig. 1.13(b)]. Compute\nthe time of fall in each case. Contrast the situation with that of ‘free\nfall under gravity’.\n\nFIGURE 1.13\n\nSolution In Fig. 1.13(a) the field is upward, so the negatively charged\nelectron experiences a downward force of magnitude eE where E is\nthe magnitude of the electric field. The acceleration of the electron is\n\na\ne\n  =  eE/m\n\ne\n\nwhere m\ne\n is the mass of the electron.\n\nStarting from rest, the time required by the electron to fall through a\n\ndistance h is given by  \n22\n\ne\n\ne\n\ne\n\nh mh\nt\n\na e E\n= =\n\nFor e = 1.6 × 10–19C, me = 9.11 × 10\n–31 kg,\n\n     E = 2.0 × 104 N C–1, h = 1.5 × 10–2 m,\n\n  te = 2.9 × 10\n–9s\n\nIn Fig. 1.13 (b), the field is downward, and the positively charged\nproton experiences a downward force of magnitude eE . The\nacceleration of the proton is\n\na\np\n  =  eE/m\n\np\n\nwhere m\np\n is the mass of the proton; m\n\np\n = 1.67 × 10–27 kg.

This is in basic contrast to the situation of ‘free\nfall under gravity’ where the time of fall is independent of the mass of\nthe body. Note that in this example we have ignored the acceleration\ndue to gravity in calculating the time of fall. To see if this is justified,\nlet us calculate the acceleration of the proton in the given electric\nfield:\n\np\n\np\n\ne E\na\n\nm\n=\n\n     \n19 4 1\n\n27\n\n(1 6 10 C) (2 0 10 N C )\n1 67 10 kg\n\n. .\n\n.\n\n− −\n\n−\n\n× × ×\n=\n\n×\n\n     12 –21 9 10 m s.= ×\n\nwhich is enormous compared to the value of g (9.8 m s–2), the\nacceleration due to gravity. The acceleration of the electron is even\ngreater. Thus, the effect of acceleration due to gravity can be ignored\nin this example.\n\nExample 1.9 Two point charges q1 and q2, of magnitude +10\n–8 C and\n\n–10–8 C, respectively, are placed 0.1 m apart.

It is a vector quantity\nand can be represented as we represent vectors. Let us try to represent E\ndue to a point charge pictorially. Let the point charge be placed at the\norigin. Draw vectors pointing along the direction of the\nelectric field with their lengths proportional to the strength\nof the field at each point. Since the magnitude of electric\nfield at a point decreases inversely as the square of the\ndistance of that point from the charge, the vector gets\nshorter as one goes away from the origin, always pointing\nradially outward. Figure 1.15 shows such a picture.  In\nthis figure, each arrow indicates the electric field, i.e., the\nforce acting on a unit positive charge, placed at the tail of\nthat arrow.  Connect the arrows pointing in one direction\nand the resulting figure represents a field line. We thus\nget many field lines, all pointing outwards from the point\ncharge. Have we lost the information about the strength\nor magnitude of the field now, because it was contained\nin the length of the arrow? No. Now the magnitude of the\nfield is represented by the density of field lines. E is strong\nnear the charge, so the density of field lines is more near\nthe charge and the lines are closer. Away from the charge,\nthe field gets weaker and the density of field lines is less,\nresulting in well-separated lines.\n\nAnother person may draw more lines. But the number of lines is not\nimportant. In fact, an infinite number of lines can be drawn in any region.\n\nFIGURE 1.15 Field of a point charge.\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n.9\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n24\n\nPhysics\n\nIt is the relative density of lines in different regions which is\nimportant.\n\nWe draw the figure on the plane of paper, i.e., in two-\ndimensions but we live in three-dimensions. So if one wishes\nto estimate the density of field lines, one has to consider the\nnumber of lines per unit cross-sectional area, perpendicular\nto the lines.  Since the electric field decreases as the square of\nthe distance from a point charge and the area enclosing the\ncharge increases as the square of the distance, the number\nof field lines crossing the enclosing area remains constant,\nwhatever may be the distance of the area from the charge.\n\nWe started by saying that the field lines carry information\nabout the direction of electric field at different points in space.\nHaving drawn a certain set of field lines, the relative density\n(i.e., closeness) of the field lines at different points indicates\nthe relative strength of electric field at those points. The field\nlines crowd where the field is strong and are spaced apart\nwhere it is weak. Figure 1.16 shows a set of field lines. We\n\ncan imagine two equal and small elements of area placed at points R and\nS normal to the field lines there. The number of field lines in our picture\ncutting the area elements is proportional to the magnitude of field at\nthese points. The picture shows that the field at R is stronger than at S.\n\nTo understand the dependence of the field lines on the area, or rather\nthe solid angle subtended by an area element, let us try to relate the\narea with the solid angle, a generalisation of angle to three dimensions.\nRecall how a (plane) angle is defined in two-dimensions. Let a small\ntransverse line element ∆l be placed at a distance r from a point O. Then\nthe angle subtended by ∆l  at O can be approximated as ∆θ = ∆l/r.\nLikewise, in three-dimensions the solid angle* subtended by a small\nperpendicular plane area ∆S, at a distance r, can be written as\n∆Ω = ∆S/r2. We know that in a given solid angle the number of radial\nfield lines is the same. In Fig. 1.16, for two points P\n\n1\n and P\n\n2\n at distances\n\nr1 and r2 from the charge, the element of area subtending the solid angle\n∆Ω is 21r ∆Ω at P1 and an element of area \n\n2\n2r ∆Ω at P2, respectively. The\n\nnumber of lines (say n) cutting these area elements are the same. The\nnumber of field lines, cutting unit area element is therefore n/( 21r ∆Ω) at\nP1 and n/(\n\n2\n2r ∆Ω) at P2, respectively. Since n and ∆Ω are common, the\n\nstrength of the field clearly has a 1/r 2 dependence.\nThe picture of field lines was invented by Faraday to develop an\n\nintuitive non-mathematical way of visualising electric fields around\ncharged configurations. Faraday called them lines of force. This term is\nsomewhat misleading, especially in case of magnetic fields. The more\n\nappropriate term is field lines (electric or magnetic) that we have\nadopted in this book.\n\nElectric field lines are thus a way of pictorially mapping the electric\nfield around a configuration of charges. An electric field line is, in general,\n\nFIGURE 1.16  Dependence of\nelectric field strength on the\n\ndistance and its relation to the\nnumber of field lines.\n\n* Solid angle is a measure of a cone. Consider the intersection of the given cone\nwith a sphere of radius R. The solid angle ∆Ω of the cone is defined to be equal\nto ∆S/R\n\n2\n, where ∆S is the area on the sphere cut out by the cone.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectric Charges\n\nand Fields\n\n25\n\na curve drawn in such a way that the tangent to it at each\npoint is in the direction of the net field at that point. An\narrow on the curve is obviously necessary to specify the\ndirection of electric field from the two possible directions\nindicated by a tangent to the curve. A field line is a space\ncurve, i.e., a curve in three dimensions.\n\nFigure 1.17 shows the field lines around some simple\ncharge configurations. As mentioned earlier, the field lines\nare in 3-dimensional space, though the figure shows them\nonly in a plane. The field lines of a single positive charge\nare radially outward while those of a single negative\ncharge are radially inward. The field lines around a system\nof two positive charges (q, q) give a vivid pictorial\ndescription of their mutual repulsion, while those around\nthe configuration of two equal and opposite charges\n(q, –q), a dipole, show clearly the mutual attraction\nbetween the charges. The field lines follow some important\ngeneral properties:\n(i) Field lines start from positive charges and end at\n\nnegative charges. If there is a single charge, they may\nstart or end at infinity.\n\n(ii) In a charge-free region, electric field lines can be taken\nto be continuous curves without any breaks.\n\n(iii) Two field lines can never cross each other. (If they did,\nthe field at the point of intersection will not have a\nunique direction, which is absurd.)\n\n(iv) Electrostatic field lines do not form any closed loops.\nThis follows from the conservative nature of electric\nfield (Chapter 2).\n\n1.10  ELECTRIC FLUX\n\nConsider flow of a liquid with velocity v, through a small\nflat surface dS, in a direction normal to the surface. The\nrate of flow of liquid is given by the volume crossing the\narea per unit time  v dS and represents the flux of liquid\nflowing across the plane. If the normal to the surface is\nnot parallel to the direction of flow of liquid, i.e., to v, but\nmakes an angle θ with it, the projected area in a plane\n\nperpendicular to v is δ dS cos θ. Therefore, the flux going\nout of the surface dS is v. n̂ dS. For the case of  the electric\nfield, we define an analogous quantity and call it electric\nflux. We should, however, note that there is no flow of a\nphysically observable quantity unlike the case of\nliquid flow.\n\nIn the picture of electric field lines described above,\nwe saw that the number of field lines crossing a unit area,\nplaced normal to the field at a point is a measure of the\nstrength of electric field at that point. This means that if\n\nFIGURE 1.17 Field lines due to\nsome simple charge configurations.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n26\n\nPhysics\n\nwe place a small planar element of area ∆S\nnormal to E at a point, the number of field lines\ncrossing it is proportional* to E ∆S. Now\nsuppose we tilt the area element by angle θ.\nClearly, the number of field lines crossing the\narea element will be smaller. The projection of\nthe area element normal to E is ∆S cosθ. Thus,\nthe number of field lines crossing ∆S is\nproportional to E ∆S cosθ. When θ = 90°, field\nlines will be parallel to ∆S and will not cross it\nat all (Fig. 1.18).\n\nThe orientation of area element and not\nmerely its magnitude is important in many\ncontexts. For example, in a stream, the amount\nof water flowing through a ring will naturally\ndepend on how you hold the ring. If you hold\nit normal to the flow, maximum water will flow\nthrough it than if you hold it with some other\norientation. This shows that an area element\nshould be treated as a vector. It has a\n\nmagnitude and also a direction. How to specify the direction of a planar\narea? Clearly, the normal to the plane specifies the orientation of the\nplane. Thus the direction of a planar area vector is along its normal.\n\nHow to associate a vector to the area of a curved surface? We imagine\ndividing the surface into a large number of very small area elements.\nEach small area element may be treated as planar and a vector associated\nwith it, as explained before.\n\nNotice one ambiguity here. The direction of an area element is along\nits normal. But a normal can point in two directions. Which direction do\nwe choose as the direction of the vector associated with the area element?\nThis problem is resolved by some convention appropriate to the given\ncontext. For the case of a closed surface, this convention is very simple.\nThe vector associated with every area element of a closed surface is taken\nto be in the direction of the outward normal. This is the convention used\nin Fig. 1.19. Thus, the area element vector ∆S at a point on a closed\n\nsurface equals ∆S n̂  where ∆S is the magnitude of the area element and\n\nn̂  is a unit vector in the direction of outward normal at that point.\nWe now come to the definition of electric flux. Electric flux ∆φ through\n\nan area element ∆S is defined by\n\n∆φ = E.∆S = E ∆S  cosθ (1.11)\n\nwhich, as seen before, is proportional to the number of field lines cutting\nthe area element. The angle θ here is the angle between E and ∆S. For a\nclosed surface, with the convention stated already, θ is the angle between\nE and the outward normal   to the area element. Notice we could look at\nthe expression E ∆S cosθ  in two ways:  E (∆S cosθ ) i.e., E times the\n\nFIGURE 1.18 Dependence of flux on the\ninclination θ between E and n̂ .\n\nFIGURE 1.19\nConvention for\ndefining normal\n\nn̂  and ∆S. * It will not be proper to say that the number of field lines is equal to E∆S. The\nnumber of field lines is after all, a matter of how many field lines we choose to\ndraw. What is physically significant is the relative number of field lines crossing\na given area at different points.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectric Charges\n\nand Fields\n\n27\n\nprojection of area normal to E,  or E\n⊥\n ∆S, i.e., component of E along the\n\nnormal to the area element times the magnitude of the area element. The\nunit of electric flux is N C–1 m2.\n\nThe basic definition of electric flux given by Eq. (1.11) can be used, in\nprinciple, to calculate the total flux through any given surface. All we\nhave to do is to divide the surface into small area elements, calculate the\nflux at each element and add them up. Thus, the total flux φ through a\nsurface S is\n\nφ ~ Σ E.∆S (1.12)\n\nThe approximation sign is put because the electric field E is taken to\nbe constant over the small area element. This is mathematically exact\nonly when you take the limit ∆S → 0  and the sum in Eq. (1.12) is written\nas an integral.\n\n1.11  ELECTRIC DIPOLE\nAn electric dipole is a pair of equal and opposite point charges q and –q,\nseparated by a distance 2a. The line connecting the two charges defines\na direction in space. By convention, the direction from –q to q is said to\nbe the direction of the dipole. The mid-point of locations of –q and q is\ncalled the centre of the dipole.\n\nThe total charge of the electric dipole is obviously zero. This does not\nmean that the field of the electric dipole is zero. Since the charge q and\n–q are separated by some distance, the electric fields due to them, when\nadded, do not exactly cancel out. However, at distances much larger than\nthe separation of the two charges forming a dipole (r >> 2a), the fields\ndue to q and –q nearly cancel out. The electric field due to a dipole\ntherefore falls off, at large distance, faster than like 1/r 2 (the dependence\non r of the field due to a single charge q). These qualitative ideas are\nborne out by the explicit calculation as follows:\n\n1.11.1  The field of an electric dipole\n\nThe electric field of the pair of charges (–q and q) at any point in space\ncan be found out from Coulomb’s law and the superposition principle.\nThe results are simple for the following two cases: (i) when the point is on\nthe dipole axis, and (ii) when it is in the equatorial plane of the dipole,\ni.e.,  on a plane perpendicular to the dipole axis through its centre.  The\nelectric field at any general point P is obtained by adding the electric\nfields E\n\n–q\n due to the charge –q and E+q due to the charge q, by the\n\nparallelogram law of vectors.\n\n(i) For points on the axis\n\nLet the point P be at distance r from the centre of the dipole on the side of\nthe charge q,  as shown in Fig. 1.20(a).

(1.15) and (1.18), it is clear that the dipole field at large\ndistances does not involve q and a separately; it depends on the product\nqa. This suggests the definition of dipole moment. The dipole moment\nvector p of an electric dipole is defined by\n\np  = q × 2a p̂ (1.19)\nthat is, it is a vector whose magnitude is charge q times the separation\n2a (between the pair of charges q, –q) and the direction is along the line\nfrom –q to q.

Further,  the magnitude and the direction\nof the dipole field depends not only on the distance r but also on the\nangle between the position vector r and the dipole moment p.\n\nWe can think of the limit when the dipole size 2a approaches zero,\nthe charge q approaches infinity in such a way that the product\np = q × 2a is finite. Such a dipole is referred to as a point dipole. For a\npoint dipole, Eqs. (1.20) and (1.21) are exact, true for any r.\n\n1.11.2  Physical significance of dipoles\n\nIn most molecules, the centres of positive charges and of negative charges*\nlie at the same place. Therefore, their dipole moment is zero. CO\n\n2\n and\n\nCH\n4\n are of this type of molecules. However, they develop a dipole moment\n\nwhen an electric field is applied. But in some molecules, the centres of\nnegative charges and of positive charges do not coincide. Therefore they\nhave a permanent electric dipole moment, even in the absence of an electric\nfield. Such molecules are called polar molecules. Water molecules, H2O,\nis an example of this type. Various materials give rise to interesting\nproperties and important applications in the presence or  absence of\nelectric field.\n\nExample 1.10 Two charges ±10 µC are placed 5.0 mm apart.\nDetermine the electric field at (a) a point P on the axis of the dipole\n15 cm away from its centre O on the side of the positive charge, as\nshown in Fig. 1.21(a), and (b) a point Q, 15 cm away from O on a line\npassing through O and normal to the axis of the dipole, as shown in\nFig. 1.21(b).\n\nFIGURE 1.21\n\n* Centre of a collection of positive point charges is defined much the same way\n\nas the centre of mass: r\nr\n\ncm =\n∑\n\n∑\n\nq\n\nq\n\ni i\ni\n\ni\ni\n\n.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n30\n\nPhysics\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n.1\n0\n\nSolution  (a) Field at P due to charge +10 µC\n\n= \n\n5\n\n12 2 1 2\n\n10 C\n\n4 (8.854 10 C N m )\n\n−\n\n− − −\nπ ×\n\n2 4 2\n\n1\n\n(15 0.25) 10 m−\n×\n\n− ×\n\n=  4.13 × 106  N C–1  along BP\nField at P due to charge –10 µC\n\n–5\n\n12 2 1 2\n\n10 C\n4 (8.854 10 C N m )− − −\n\n=\nπ ×\n\n 2 4 2\n1\n\n(15 0.25) 10 m−\n×\n\n+ ×\n\n=  3.86 × 106  N C–1 along PA\nThe resultant electric field at P due to the two charges at A and B is\n=  2.7 × 105  N C–1  along BP.\nIn this example, the ratio OP/OB is quite large (= 60). Thus, we can\nexpect to get approximately the same result as above by directly using\nthe formula for electric field at a far-away point on the axis of a dipole.\nFor a dipole consisting of charges ± q, 2a distance apart, the electric\nfield at a distance r from the centre on the axis of the dipole has a\nmagnitude\n\nE\np\n\nr\n=\n\n2\n\n4 0\n3\n\nπε\n(r/a >> 1)\n\nwhere p = 2a q is the magnitude of the dipole moment.\nThe direction of electric field on the dipole axis is always along the\ndirection of the dipole moment vector (i.e., from –q to q). Here,\np =10–5 C × 5 × 10–3 m  = 5 × 10–8 C m\nTherefore,\n\nE  =\n8\n\n12 2 1 2\n\n2 5 10 Cm\n\n4 (8.854 10 C N m )\n\n−\n\n− − −\n\n× ×\n\nπ ×\n3 6 3\n\n1\n\n(15) 10 m−\n×\n\n×\n = 2.6 × 105  N C–1\n\nalong the dipole moment direction AB, which is close to the result\nobtained earlier.\n(b) Field at Q due to charge + 10 µC at B\n\n=\n5\n\n12 2 1 2\n\n10 C\n4 (8.854 10 C N m )\n\n−\n\n− − −π ×\n2 2 4 2\n\n1\n\n[15 (0.25) ] 10 m−+ ×\n×\n\n=  3.99 × 106  N C–1 along BQ\n\nField at Q due to charge –10 µC at A\n\n=\n5\n\n12 2 1 2\n\n10 C\n\n4 (8.854 10 C N m )\n\n−\n\n− − −\nπ ×\n\n2 2 4 2\n\n1\n\n[15 (0.25) ] 10 m−+ ×\n×\n\n=  3.99 × 106  N C–1 along QA.\n\nClearly, the components of these two forces with equal magnitudes\ncancel along the direction OQ but add up along the direction parallel\nto BA.

Again, the result agrees with that obtained\nbefore.\n\n1.12  DIPOLE IN A UNIFORM EXTERNAL FIELD\nConsider a permanent dipole of dipole moment p in a uniform\nexternal field E, as shown in Fig. 1.22. (By permanent dipole, we\nmean that p exists  irrespective of E; it has not been induced by E.)\n\nThere is a force qE on q and a force –qE on –q. The net force on\nthe dipole is zero, since E is uniform. However, the charges are\nseparated, so the forces act at different points, resulting in a torque\non the dipole. When the net force is zero, the torque (couple) is\nindependent of the origin. Its magnitude equals the magnitude of\neach force multiplied by the arm of the couple (perpendicular\ndistance between the two antiparallel forces).\n\nMagnitude of torque = q E × 2 a sinθ\n       = 2 q a E sinθ\n\nIts direction is normal to the plane of the paper, coming out of it.\nThe magnitude of p × E is also p E sinθ and its direction\n\nis normal to the paper, coming out of it. Thus,\n\nτττττ  = p × E (1.22)\n\nThis torque will tend to align the dipole with the field\nE. When p is aligned with E, the torque is zero.\n\nWhat happens if the field is not uniform? In that case,\nthe net force will evidently be non-zero. In addition there\nwill, in general, be a torque on the system as before. The\ngeneral case is involved, so let us consider the simpler\nsituations when p is parallel to E or antiparallel to E. In\neither case, the net torque is zero, but there is a net force\non the dipole if E is not uniform.\n\nFigure 1.23 is self-explanatory. It is easily seen that\nwhen p is parallel to E, the dipole has a net force in the\ndirection of increasing field. When p is antiparallel to E,\nthe net force on the dipole is in the direction of decreasing\nfield. In general, the force depends on the orientation of p\nwith respect to E.\n\nThis brings us to a common observation in frictional\nelectricity. A comb run through dry hair attracts pieces of\npaper. The comb, as we know, acquires charge through\nfriction. But the paper is not charged. What then explains\nthe attractive force? Taking the clue from the preceding\n\nFIGURE 1.22 Dipole in a\nuniform electric field.\n\nFIGURE 1.23 Electric force on a\ndipole: (a) E parallel to p, (b)  E\n\nantiparallel to p.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n32\n\nPhysics\n\ndiscussion, the charged comb ‘polarises’ the piece of paper, i.e., induces\na net dipole moment in the direction of field. Further, the electric field\ndue to the comb is not uniform. This non-uniformity of the field makes a\ndipole to experience a net force on it. In this situation, it is easily seen\nthat the paper should move in the direction of the comb!\n\n1.13  CONTINUOUS CHARGE DISTRIBUTION\nWe have so far dealt with charge configurations involving discrete charges\nq\n\n1\n, q\n\n2\n, ..., q\n\nn\n. One reason why we restricted to discrete charges is that the\n\nmathematical treatment is simpler and does not involve calculus. For\nmany purposes, however, it is impractical to work in terms of discrete\ncharges and we need to work with continuous charge distributions. For\nexample, on the surface of a charged conductor, it is impractical to specify\nthe charge distribution in terms of the locations of the microscopic charged\nconstituents. It is more feasible to consider an area element ∆S (Fig. 1.24)\non the surface of the conductor (which is very small on the macroscopic\nscale but big enough to include a very large number of electrons) and\nspecify the charge ∆Q on that element. We then define a surface charge\ndensity σ at the area element by\n\nQ\n\nS\nσ\n\n∆\n=\n\n∆\n(1.23)\n\nWe can do this at different points on the conductor and thus arrive at\na continuous function σ, called the surface charge density. The surface\ncharge density σ  so defined ignores the quantisation of charge and the\ndiscontinuity in charge distribution at the microscopic level*. σ  represents\nmacroscopic surface charge density, which in a sense, is a smoothed out\naverage of the microscopic charge density over an area element ∆S which,\nas said before, is large microscopically but small macroscopically. The\nunits for σ are C/m2.\n\nSimilar considerations apply for a line charge distribution and a volume\ncharge distribution. The linear charge density λ of a wire is defined by\n\nQ\n\nl\nλ\n\n∆\n=\n\n∆\n(1.24)\n\nwhere ∆l is a small line element of wire on the macroscopic scale that,\nhowever, includes a large number of microscopic charged constituents,\nand ∆Q is the charge contained in that line element. The units for λ are\nC/m. The volume charge density (sometimes simply called charge density)\nis defined in a similar manner:\n\nQ\n\nV\nρ\n\n∆\n=\n\n∆\n(1.25)\n\nwhere ∆Q is the charge included in the macroscopically small volume\nelement ∆V that includes a large number of microscopic charged\nconstituents. The units for ρ are C/m3.\n\nThe notion of continuous charge distribution is similar to that we\nadopt for continuous mass distribution in mechanics. When we refer to\n\nFIGURE 1.24\n\nDefinition of linear,\nsurface and volume\n\ncharge densities.\nIn each case, the\n\nelement (∆l, ∆S, ∆V )\nchosen is small on\nthe macroscopic\n\nscale but contains\na very large number\n\nof microscopic\nconstituents.\n\n* At the microscopic level, charge distribution is discontinuous, because they are\ndiscrete charges separated by intervening space where there is no charge.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectric Charges\n\nand Fields\n\n33\n\nthe density of a liquid, we are referring to its macroscopic density. We\nregard it as a continuous fluid and ignore its discrete molecular\nconstitution.\n\nThe field due to a continuous charge distribution can be obtained in\nmuch the same way as for a system of discrete charges, Eq. (1.10). Suppose\na continuous charge distribution in space has a charge density ρ. Choose\nany convenient origin O and let the position vector of any point in the\ncharge distribution be r. The charge density ρ may vary from point to\npoint, i.e., it is a function of r. Divide the charge distribution into small\nvolume elements of size ∆V. The charge in a volume element ∆V is ρ∆V.\n\nNow, consider any general point P (inside or outside the distribution)\nwith position vector R (Fig. 1.24). Electric field due to the charge ρ∆V is\ngiven by Coulomb’s law:\n\n2\n0\n\n1\nˆ\n\n4\nV\n\n'\nr'\n\nρ\n\nε\n\n∆\n∆ =\n\nπ\nE r (1.26)\n\nwhere r′ is the distance between the charge element and P, and  r̂ ′ is a\nunit vector in the direction from the charge element to P. By the\nsuperposition principle, the total electric field due to the charge\ndistribution is obtained by summing over electric fields due to different\nvolume elements:\n\n2\n0\n\n1\nˆ\n\n4 all V\nV\n\n'\nr'\n\nρ\n\nε ∆\n∆\n\n≅ Σ\nπ\n\nE r (1.27)\n\nNote that ρ, r′,  ˆ ′r  all can vary from point to point. In a strict\nmathematical method, we should let ∆V→0 and the sum then becomes\nan integral; but we omit that discussion here, for simplicity. In short,\nusing Coulomb’s law and the superposition principle, electric field can\nbe determined for any charge distribution, discrete or continuous or part\ndiscrete and part continuous.\n\n1.14  GAUSS’S LAW\nAs a simple application of the notion of electric flux, let us consider the\ntotal flux through a sphere of radius r, which encloses a point charge q\nat its centre. Divide the sphere into small area elements, as shown in\nFig. 1.25.\n\nThe flux through an area element ∆S is\n\n2\n0\n\nˆ\n4\n\nq\n\nr\nφ\n\nε\n∆ = ∆ = ∆\n\nπ\nE S r Si i (1.28)\n\nwhere we have used Coulomb’s law for the electric field due to a single\ncharge q. The unit vector r̂  is along the radius vector from the centre to\nthe area element. Now, since the normal to a sphere at every point is\nalong the radius vector at that point, the area element ∆S and r̂   have\nthe same direction. Therefore,\n\n2\n04\nq\n\nS\nr\n\nφ\nε\n\n∆ = ∆\nπ\n\n(1.29)\n\nsince the magnitude of a unit vector is 1.\nThe total flux through the sphere is obtained by adding up flux\n\nthrough all the different area elements:\n\nFIGURE 1.25 Flux\nthrough a sphere\nenclosing a point\n\ncharge q at its centre.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n34\n\nPhysics\n\n2\n04all S\n\nq\nS\n\nr\nφ\n\nε∆\n= Σ ∆\n\nπ\n\nSince each area element of the sphere is at the same\ndistance r from the charge,\n\n2 2\n04 4all So\n\nq q\nS S\n\nr r\nφ\n\nε ε∆\n= Σ ∆ =\n\nπ π\n\nNow S, the total area of the sphere, equals 4πr2. Thus,\n\n2\n2\n\n00\n\n4\n4\n\nq q\nr\n\nr\nφ\n\nεε\n= × π =\n\nπ\n(1.30)\n\nEquation (1.30) is a simple illustration of a general result of\nelectrostatics called Gauss’s law.\n\nWe state Gauss’s law without proof:\nElectric flux through a closed surface S\n\n= q/ε\n0\n\n(1.31)\n\nq = total charge enclosed by S.\n\nThe law implies that the total electric flux through a closed surface is\nzero if no charge is enclosed by the surface. We can see that explicitly in\nthe simple situation of Fig. 1.26.\n\nHere the electric field is uniform and we are considering a closed\ncylindrical surface, with its axis parallel to the uniform field E. The total\nflux φ  through the surface is  φ = φ\n\n1\n + φ\n\n2\n + φ\n\n3\n, where φ\n\n1\n and φ\n\n2\n represent\n\nthe flux through the surfaces 1 and 2 (of circular cross-section) of the\ncylinder and φ\n\n3\n is the flux through the curved cylindrical part of the\n\nclosed surface. Now the normal to the surface 3 at every point is\nperpendicular to E, so by definition of flux, φ3 = 0. Further, the outward\nnormal to 2 is along E while the outward normal to 1 is opposite to E.\nTherefore,\n\nφ\n1\n = –E S\n\n1\n,     φ\n\n2\n = +E S\n\n2\n\nS\n1\n = S\n\n2\n = S\n\nwhere S is the area of circular cross-section. Thus, the total flux is zero,\nas expected by Gauss’s law. Thus, whenever you find that the net electric\nflux through a closed surface is zero, we conclude that the total charge\ncontained in the closed surface is zero.\n\nThe great significance of Gauss’s law Eq. (1.31), is that it is true in\ngeneral, and not only for the simple cases we have considered above. Let\nus note some important points regarding this law:\n(i) Gauss’s law is true for any closed surface, no matter what its shape\n\nor size.\n(ii) The term q on the right side of Gauss’s law, Eq. (1.31), includes the\n\nsum of all charges enclosed by the surface. The charges may be located\nanywhere inside the surface.\n\n(iii) In the situation when the surface is so chosen that there are some\ncharges inside and some outside, the electric field [whose flux appears\non the left side of Eq. (1.31)] is due to all the charges, both inside and\noutside S. The term q on the right side of Gauss’s law, however,\nrepresents only the total charge inside S.\n\nFIGURE 1.26 Calculation of the\nflux of uniform electric field\n\nthrough the surface of a cylinder.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectric Charges\n\nand Fields\n\n35\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n.1\n1\n\n(iv) The surface that we choose for the application of Gauss’s law is called\nthe Gaussian surface. You may choose any Gaussian surface and\napply Gauss’s law. However, take care not to let the Gaussian surface\npass through any discrete charge. This is because electric field due\nto a system of discrete charges is not well defined at the location of\nany charge. (As you go close to the charge, the field grows without\nany bound.) However, the Gaussian surface can pass through a\ncontinuous charge distribution.\n\n(v) Gauss’s law is often useful towards a much easier calculation of the\nelectrostatic field when the system has some symmetry. This is\nfacilitated by the choice of a suitable Gaussian surface.\n\n(vi) Finally, Gauss’s law is based on the inverse square dependence on\ndistance contained in the Coulomb’s law. Any violation of Gauss’s\nlaw will indicate departure from the inverse square law.\n\nExample 1.11 The electric field components in Fig. 1.27 are\nE\n\nx\n = αx1/2, E\n\ny\n = E\n\nz\n = 0, in which α = 800 N/C m1/2. Calculate (a) the\n\nflux through the cube, and (b) the charge within the cube.

Therefore, the flux out of the side of the\ncylinder is zero.\n\n(c) Net outward flux through the cylinder\nφ\n\n \n= 1.57 + 1.57 + 0 = 3.14 N m2 C–1\n\nFIGURE 1.28\n\n (d) The net charge within the cylinder can be found by using Gauss’s\nlaw which gives\nq =  ε0φ\n   =  3.14 × 8.854 × 10–12  C\n   =  2.78 × 10–11 C\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectric Charges\n\nand Fields\n\n37\n\n1.15  APPLICATIONS OF GAUSS’S LAW\nThe electric field due to a general charge distribution is, as seen above,\ngiven by Eq. (1.27). In practice, except for some special cases, the\nsummation (or integration) involved in this equation cannot be carried\nout to give electric field at every point in\nspace. For some symmetric charge\nconfigurations, however, it is possible to\nobtain the electric field in a simple way using\nthe Gauss’s law. This is best understood by\nsome examples.\n\n1.15.1 Field due to an infinitely\nlong straight uniformly\ncharged wire\n\nConsider an infinitely long thin straight wire\nwith uniform linear charge density λ. The wire\nis obviously an axis of symmetry. Suppose we\ntake the radial vector from O to P and rotate it\naround the wire. The points P, P′, P′′ so\nobtained are completely equivalent with\nrespect to the charged wire. This implies that\nthe electric field must have the same magnitude\nat these points. The direction of electric field at\nevery point must be radial (outward if λ > 0,\ninward if λ < 0). This is clear from Fig. 1.29.\n\nConsider a pair of line elements P\n1\n and P\n\n2\nof the wire, as shown. The electric fields\nproduced by the two elements of the pair when\nsummed give a resultant electric field which\nis radial (the components normal to the radial\nvector cancel). This is true for any such pair\nand hence the total field at any point P is\nradial. Finally, since the wire is infinite,\nelectric field does not depend on the position\nof P along the length of the wire. In short, the\nelectric field is everywhere radial in the plane\ncutting the wire normally, and its magnitude\ndepends only on the radial distance r.\n\nTo calculate the field, imagine a cylindrical\nGaussian surface, as shown in the Fig. 1.29(b).\nSince the field is everywhere radial, flux\nthrough the two ends of the cylindrical\nGaussian surface is zero. At the cylindrical\npart of the surface, E is normal to the surface\nat every point, and its magnitude is constant,\nsince it depends only on r. The surface area\nof the curved part is  2πrl, where l is the length\nof the cylinder.\n\nFIGURE 1.29 (a) Electric field due to an\ninfinitely long thin straight wire is radial,\n(b) The Gaussian surface for a long thin\nwire of uniform linear charge density.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n38\n\nPhysics\n\nFlux through the Gaussian surface\n\n= flux through the curved cylindrical part of the surface\n\n= E × 2πrl\n\nThe surface includes charge equal to λ l. Gauss’s law then gives\nE × 2πrl = λl/ε\n\n0\n\ni.e., E  = \n02 r\n\nλ\n\nεπ\n\nVectorially, E at any point is given by\n\n0\n\nˆ\n2 r\n\nλ\n\nε\n=\n\nπ\nE n (1.32)\n\nwhere n̂  is the radial unit vector in the plane normal to the wire passing\nthrough the point. E is directed outward if λ is positive and inward if λ is\nnegative.\n\nNote that when we write a vector A as a scalar multiplied by a unit\nvector, i.e., as A = A â , the scalar A is  an algebraic number. It can be\nnegative or positive. The direction of A will be the same as that of the unit\nvector â if A > 0 and opposite to â  if A < 0. When we want to restrict to\nnon-negative values, we use the symbol A and call it the modulus of A .\nThus, 0≥A .\n\nAlso note that though only  the charge enclosed by the surface (λl )\nwas included above, the electric field E is due to the charge on the entire\nwire. Further, the assumption that the wire is infinitely long is crucial.\nWithout this assumption, we cannot take E to be normal to the curved\npart of the cylindrical Gaussian surface. However, Eq. (1.32) is\napproximately true for electric field around the central portions of a long\nwire, where the end effects may be ignored.\n\n1.15.2  Field due to a uniformly charged infinite plane sheet\n\nLet σ be the uniform surface charge density of an infinite plane sheet\n(Fig. 1.30). We take the x-axis normal to the given plane. By symmetry,\nthe electric field will not depend on y and z coordinates and its direction\n\nat every point must be parallel to the x-direction.\nWe can take the Gaussian surface to be a\n\nrectangular parallelepiped of cross-sectional area\nA, as shown. (A cylindrical surface will also do.) As\nseen from the figure, only the two faces 1 and 2 will\ncontribute to the flux; electric field lines are parallel\nto the other faces and they, therefore, do not\ncontribute to the total flux.\n\nThe unit vector normal to surface 1 is in –x\ndirection while  the unit  vector normal to surface 2\nis in the +x direction. Therefore, flux  E.∆S through\nboth the surfaces are equal and add up. Therefore\nthe net flux through the Gaussian surface is 2 EA.\nThe charge enclosed by the closed surface is σA.\nTherefore by Gauss’s law,\n\nFIGURE 1.30 Gaussian surface for a\nuniformly charged infinite plane sheet.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectric Charges\n\nand Fields\n\n39\n\n2 EA = σA/ε\n0\n\nor,  E = σ/2ε\n0\n\nVectorically,\n\n0\n\nˆ\n2\nσ\n\nε\n=E n (1.33)\n\nwhere n̂  is a unit vector normal to the plane and going away from it.\nE is directed away from the plate if σ  is positive and toward the plate\n\nif σ is negative. Note that the above application of the Gauss’ law has\nbrought out an additional fact: E is independent of x also.\n\nFor a finite large planar sheet, Eq. (1.33) is approximately true in the\nmiddle regions of the planar sheet, away from the ends.\n\n1.15.3  Field due to a uniformly charged thin spherical shell\n\nLet σ be the uniform surface charge density of a thin spherical shell of\nradius R (Fig. 1.31). The situation has obvious spherical symmetry. The\nfield at any point P, outside or inside, can depend only on r (the radial\ndistance from the centre of the shell to the point) and must be radial (i.e.,\nalong the radius vector).\n\n(i) Field outside the shell: Consider a point P outside the\nshell with radius vector r. To calculate E at P, we take the\nGaussian surface to be a sphere of radius r and with centre\nO, passing through P. All points on this sphere are equivalent\nrelative to the given charged configuration. (That is what we\nmean by spherical symmetry.) The electric field at each point\nof the Gaussian surface, therefore, has the same magnitude\nE and is along the radius vector at each point. Thus, E and\n∆S at every point are parallel and the flux through each\nelement is E ∆S. Summing over all ∆S, the flux through the\nGaussian surface is E × 4 π r 2. The charge enclosed is\nσ × 4 π R 2. By Gauss’s law\n\nE × 4 π r 2 = \n2\n\n0\n\n4 R\nσ\n\nε\nπ\n\nOr,  \n2\n\n2 2\n0 04\nR q\n\nE\nr r\n\nσ\n\nε ε\n= =\n\nπ\n\nwhere q  =  4 π R2 σ is the total charge on the spherical shell.\nVectorially,\n\n2\n0\n\nˆ\n4\n\nq\n\nrε\n=\n\nπ\nE r (1.34)\n\nThe electric field is directed outward if q > 0 and inward if\nq < 0. This, however, is exactly the field produced by a charge\nq placed at the centre O. Thus for points outside the shell, the field due\nto a uniformly charged shell is as if  the entire charge of the shell is\nconcentrated at its centre.\n\n(ii) Field inside the shell: In Fig. 1.31(b), the point P is inside the\nshell. The Gaussian surface is again a sphere through P centred at O.\n\nFIGURE 1.31 Gaussian\nsurfaces for a point with\n\n(a) r > R, (b) r < R.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n40\n\nPhysics\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n.1\n3\n\nThe flux through the Gaussian surface, calculated as before, is\nE × 4 π r2. However, in this case, the Gaussian surface encloses no\ncharge. Gauss’s law then gives\nE × 4 π r2 =  0\ni.e., E = 0          (r < R ) (1.35)\n\nthat is, the field due to a uniformly charged thin shell is zero at all points\ninside the shell*. This important result is a direct consequence of Gauss’s\nlaw which follows from Coulomb’s law. The experimental verification of\nthis result confirms the 1/r2 dependence in Coulomb’s law.\n\nExample 1.13 An early model for an atom considered it to have a\npositively charged point nucleus of charge Ze, surrounded by a\nuniform density of negative charge up to a radius R. The atom as a\nwhole is neutral. For this model, what is the electric field at a distance\nr from the nucleus?\n\nFIGURE 1.32\n\nSolution  The charge distribution for this model of the atom is as\nshown in Fig. 1.32. The total negative charge in the uniform spherical\ncharge distribution of radius R must be –Z e, since the atom (nucleus\nof charge Z e + negative charge) is neutral. This immediately gives us\nthe negative charge density ρ, since we must have\n\n34\n0–\n\n3\n\nR\nZeρ\n\nπ\n=\n\nor 3\n3\n\n4\nZe\n\nR\nρ = −\n\nπ\n\nTo find the electric field E(r) at a point P which is a distance r away\nfrom the nucleus, we use Gauss’s law. Because of the spherical\nsymmetry of the charge distribution, the magnitude of the electric\nfield E(r) depends only on the radial distance, no matter what the\ndirection of r. Its direction is along (or opposite to) the radius vector r\nfrom the origin to the point P. The obvious Gaussian surface is a\nspherical surface centred at the nucleus. We consider two situations,\nnamely, r < R and r > R.\n(i) r < R : The electric flux φ enclosed by the spherical surface is\n\n    φ  =  E (r ) × 4 π r 2\n\nwhere E (r )  is the magnitude of the electric field at r. This is because\n\n* Compare this with a uniform mass shell discussed in Section 8.5 of Class XI\nTextbook of Physics.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectric Charges\n\nand Fields\n\n41\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n.1\n3\n\nthe field at any point on the spherical Gaussian surface has the\nsame direction as the normal to the surface there,  and has the same\nmagnitude at all points on the surface.\nThe charge q enclosed by the Gaussian surface is the positive nuclear\ncharge and the negative charge within the sphere of radius r,\n\ni.e., \n34\n\n3\n\nr\nq Z e ρ\n\nπ\n= +\n\nSubstituting for the charge density ρ  obtained earlier, we have\n3\n\n3\n\nr\nq Z e Z e\n\nR\n= −\n\nGauss’s law then gives,\n\n2 3\n0\n\n1\n( ) ;\n\n4\nZ e r\n\nE r r R\nr Rε\n\n  \n= − <    π\n\nThe electric field is directed radially outward.\n(ii) r > R:  In this case, the total charge enclosed by the Gaussian\nspherical surface is zero since the atom is neutral. Thus, from Gauss’s\nlaw,\nE (r ) × 4 π  r 2 = 0  or  E (r ) = 0;    r > R\nAt r = R, both cases give the same result: E = 0.\n\nON SYMMETRY OPERATIONS\n\nIn Physics, we often encounter systems with various symmetries. Consideration of these\nsymmetries helps one arrive at results much faster than otherwise by a straightforward\ncalculation. Consider, for example an infinite uniform sheet of charge (surface charge\ndensity σ) along the y-z plane. This system is unchanged if (a) translated parallel to the\ny-z plane in any direction, (b) rotated about the x-axis through any angle. As the system\nis unchanged under such symmetry operation, so must its properties be. In particular,\nin this example, the electric field E must be unchanged.\n\nTranslation symmetry along the y-axis shows that the electric field must be the same\nat a point (0, y\n\n1\n, 0) as at (0, y\n\n2\n, 0). Similarly translational symmetry along the z-axis\n\nshows that the electric field at two point (0, 0, z\n1\n) and (0, 0, z\n\n2\n) must be the same. By\n\nusing rotation symmetry around the x-axis, we can conclude that E must be\nperpendicular to the y-z plane, that is, it must be parallel to the x-direction.\n\nTry to think of a symmetry now which will tell you that the magnitude of the electric\nfield is a constant, independent of the x-coordinate. It thus turns out that the magnitude\nof the electric field due to a uniformly charged infinite conducting sheet is the same at all\npoints in space. The direction, however, is opposite of each other on either side of\nthe sheet.\n\nCompare this with the effort needed to arrive at this result by a direct calculation\nusing Coulomb’s law.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n42\n\nPhysics\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. Electric and magnetic forces determine the properties of atoms,\nmolecules and bulk matter.\n\n2. From simple experiments on frictional electricity, one can infer that\nthere are two types of charges in nature; and that like charges repel\nand unlike charges attract. By convention, the charge on a glass rod\nrubbed with silk is positive; that on a plastic rod rubbed with fur is\nthen negative.\n\n3. Conductors allow movement of electric charge through them, insulators\ndo not. In metals, the mobile charges are electrons; in electrolytes\nboth positive and negative ions are mobile.\n\n4. Electric charge has three basic properties: quantisation, additivity\nand conservation.\n\nQuantisation of electric charge means that total charge (q) of a body\nis always an integral multiple of a basic quantum of charge (e) i.e.,\nq = n e, where n = 0, ±1, ±2, ±3, .... Proton and electron have charges\n+e, –e, respectively. For macroscopic charges for which n is a very large\nnumber, quantisation of charge can be ignored.\n\nAdditivity of electric charges means that the total charge of a system\nis the algebraic sum (i.e., the sum taking into account proper signs)\nof all individual charges in the system.\n\nConservation of electric charges means that the total charge of an\nisolated system remains unchanged with time. This means that when\nbodies are charged through friction, there is a transfer of electric charge\nfrom one body to another, but no creation or destruction of charge.\n\n5. Coulomb’s Law: The mutual electrostatic force between two point\ncharges q1 and q2 is proportional to the product q1q2 and inversely\nproportional to the square of the distance r\n\n21\n separating them.\n\nMathematically,\n\nF\n21\n\n = force on q\n2\n due to  1 21 212\n\n21\n\nˆ\nk (q q )\n\nq\nr\n\n= r\n\nwhere 21r̂  is a unit vector in the direction from q1 to q2 and k =  \n0\n\n1\n4 επ\n\nis the constant of proportionality.\n\nIn SI units, the unit of charge is coulomb. The experimental value of\nthe constant ε\n\n0\n is\n\nε0 = 8.854 × 10\n–12 C2 N–1 m–2\n\nThe approximate value of k is\n\nk = 9 × 109 N m2 C–2\n\n6. The ratio of electric force and gravitational force between a proton\nand an electron is\n\n2\n392 4 10\n\ne p\n\nk e\n.\n\nG m m\n≅ ×\n\n7. Superposition Principle: The principle is based on the property that the\nforces with which two charges attract or repel each other are not\naffected by the presence of a third (or more) additional charge(s). For\nan assembly of charges q1, q2, q3, ..., the force on any charge, say q1, is\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectric Charges\n\nand Fields\n\n43\n\nthe vector sum of the force on  q\n1\n due to q\n\n2\n, the force on q\n\n1\n due to q\n\n3\n,\n\nand so on. For each pair, the force is given by the Coulomb’s law for\ntwo charges stated earlier.\n\n8. The electric field E at a point due to a charge configuration is the\nforce on a small positive test charge q placed at the point divided by\nthe magnitude of the charge. Electric field due to a point charge q has\na magnitude |q|/4πε\n\n0\nr2; it is radially outwards from q, if q is positive,\n\nand radially inwards if q is negative. Like Coulomb force, electric field\nalso satisfies superposition principle.\n\n9. An electric field line is a curve drawn in such a way that the tangent\nat each point on the curve gives the direction of electric field at that\npoint. The relative closeness of field lines indicates the relative strength\nof electric field at different points; they crowd near each other in regions\nof strong electric field and are far apart where the electric field is\nweak. In regions of constant electric field, the field lines are uniformly\nspaced parallel straight lines.\n\n10. Some of the important properties of field lines are: (i) Field lines are\ncontinuous curves without any breaks. (ii) Two field lines cannot cross\neach other. (iii) Electrostatic field lines start at positive charges and\nend at negative charges —they cannot form closed loops.\n\n11. An electric dipole is a pair of equal and opposite charges q and –q\nseparated by some distance 2a. Its dipole moment vector p has\nmagnitude 2qa and is in the direction of the dipole axis from –q to q.\n\n12.

In a uniform electric field E, a dipole experiences a torque ττττ  given by\n\nττττ  = p × E\n\nbut experiences no net force.\n\n14. The flux ∆φ of electric field E through a small area element ∆S is\ngiven by\n\n ∆φ  = E.∆S\n\nThe vector area element ∆S is\n\n∆S = ∆S n̂\n\nwhere ∆S is the magnitude of the area element and n̂  is normal to the\narea element, which can be considered planar for sufficiently small ∆S.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n44\n\nPhysics\n\nFor an area element of a closed surface, n̂  is taken to be the direction\nof outward normal, by convention.\n\n15. Gauss’s law: The flux of electric field through any closed surface S is\n1/ε\n\n0 \ntimes the total charge enclosed by S.

You might wonder why the protons, all carrying positive charges, are\ncompactly residing inside the nucleus. Why do they not fly away? You\nwill learn that there is a third kind of a fundamental force, called the\nstrong force which holds them together. The range of distance where\nthis force is effective is, however, very small ~10-14 m. This is precisely\nthe size of the nucleus. Also the electrons are not allowed to sit on\ntop of the protons, i.e. inside the nucleus, due to the laws of quantum\nmechanics. This gives the atoms their structure as they exist in nature.\n\n2. Coulomb force and gravitational force follow the same inverse-square\nlaw. But gravitational force has only one sign (always attractive), while\nCoulomb force can be of both signs (attractive and repulsive), allowing\npossibility of cancellation of electric forces. This is how gravity, despite\nbeing a much weaker force, can be a dominating and more pervasive\nforce in nature.\n\n3. The constant of proportionality k in Coulomb’s law is a matter of\nchoice if the unit of charge is to be defined using Coulomb’s law. In SI\nunits, however, what is defined is the unit of current (A) via its magnetic\neffect (Ampere’s law) and the unit of charge (coulomb) is simply defined\nby (1C = 1 A s). In this case, the value of k is no longer arbitrary; it is\napproximately 9 × 109 N m2 C–2.\n\n4. The rather large value of k, i.e., the large size of the unit of charge\n(1C) from the point of view of electric effects arises because (as\nmentioned in point 3 already) the unit of charge is defined in terms of\nmagnetic forces (forces on  current–carrying wires) which are generally\nmuch weaker than the electric forces. Thus while 1 ampere is a unit\nof reasonable size for magnetic effects, 1 C = 1 A s, is too big a unit for\nelectric effects.\n\n5. The additive property of charge is not an ‘obvious’ property. It is related\nto the fact that electric charge has no direction associated with it;\ncharge is a scalar.\n\n6. Charge is not only a scalar (or invariant) under rotation; it is also\ninvariant for frames of reference in relative motion. This is not always\ntrue for every scalar. For example, kinetic energy is a scalar under\nrotation, but is not invariant for frames of reference in relative\nmotion.\n\n7. Conservation of total charge of an isolated system is a property\nindependent of the scalar nature of charge noted in point 6.\nConservation refers to invariance in time in a given frame of reference.\nA quantity may be scalar but not conserved (like kinetic energy in an\ninelastic collision). On the other hand, one can have conserved vector\nquantity (e.g., angular momentum of an isolated system).\n\n8. Quantisation of electric charge is a basic (unexplained) law of nature;\ninterestingly, there is no analogous law on quantisation of mass.\n\n9. Superposition principle should not be regarded as ‘obvious’, or equated\nwith the law of addition of vectors. It says two things: force on one\ncharge due to another charge is unaffected by the presence of other\ncharges, and there are no additional three-body, four-body, etc., forces\nwhich arise only when there are more than two charges.\n\n10. The electric field due to a discrete charge configuration is not defined\nat the locations of the discrete charges. For continuous volume charge\ndistribution, it is defined at any point in the distribution. For a surface\ncharge distribution, electric field is discontinuous across the surface.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n46\n\nPhysics\n\n11. The electric field due to a charge configuration with total charge zero\nis not zero; but for distances large compared to the size of\nthe configuration, its field falls off faster than 1/r 2, typical of field\ndue to a single charge. An electric dipole is the simplest example of\nthis fact.\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1.1 What is the force between  two small charged spheres having\ncharges of 2 × 10–7C and 3 × 10–7C placed 30 cm apart in air?\n\n1.2 The electrostatic force on a small sphere of charge 0.4 µC due to\nanother small sphere of charge –0.8 µC in air is 0.2 N.
