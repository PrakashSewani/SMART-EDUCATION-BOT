Before the discovery of\ntransistor in 1948, such devices were mostly vacuum tubes (also called\nvalves) like the vacuum diode which has two electrodes, viz., anode (often\ncalled plate) and cathode; triode which has three electrodes – cathode,\nplate and grid; tetrode and pentode (respectively with 4 and 5 electrodes).\nIn a vacuum tube, the electrons are supplied by a heated cathode and\nthe controlled flow of these electrons in vacuum is obtained by varying\nthe voltage between its different electrodes. Vacuum is required in the\ninter-electrode space; otherwise the moving electrons may lose their\nenergy on collision with the air molecules in their path. In these devices\nthe electrons can flow only from the cathode to the anode (i.e., only in one\ndirection). Therefore, such devices are generally referred to as valves.\nThese vacuum tube devices are bulky, consume high power, operate\ngenerally at high voltages (~100 V) and have limited life and low reliability.\nThe seed of the development of modern solid-state semiconductor\nelectronics goes back to 1930’s when it was realised that some solid-\nstate semiconductors and their junctions offer the possibility of controlling\nthe number and the direction of flow of charge carriers through them.\nSimple excitations like light, heat or small applied voltage can change\nthe number of mobile charges in a semiconductor. Note that the supply\n\nChapter Fourteen\n\nSEMICONDUCTOR\nELECTRONICS:\nMATERIALS, DEVICES\n\nAND SIMPLE CIRCUITS\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n468\n\nand flow of charge carriers in the semiconductor devices are within the\nsolid itself, while in the earlier vacuum tubes/valves, the mobile electrons\nwere obtained from a heated cathode and they were made to flow in an\nevacuated space or vacuum. No external heating or large evacuated space\nis required by the semiconductor devices. They are small in size, consume\nlow power, operate at low voltages and have long life and high reliability.\nEven the Cathode Ray Tubes (CRT) used in television and computer\nmonitors which work on the principle of vacuum tubes are being replaced\nby Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) monitors with supporting solid state\nelectronics. Much before the full implications of the semiconductor devices\nwas formally understood, a naturally occurring crystal of galena (Lead\nsulphide, PbS) with a metal point contact attached to it was used as\ndetector of radio waves.\n\nIn the following sections, we will introduce the basic concepts of\nsemiconductor physics and discuss some semiconductor devices like\njunction diodes (a 2-electrode device) and bipolar junction transistor (a\n3-electrode device). A few circuits illustrating their applications will also\nbe described.\n\n14.2 CLASSIFICATION OF METALS, CONDUCTORS AND\nSEMICONDUCTORS\n\nOn the basis of conductivity\nOn the basis of the relative values of electrical conductivity (σ ) or resistivity\n(ρ = 1/σ ), the solids are broadly classified as:\n(i) Metals: They possess very low resistivity (or high conductivity).\n\nρ ~ 10–2 – 10–8 Ω m\nσ ~ 102 – 108 S m–1\n\n(ii) Semiconductors: They have resistivity or conductivity intermediate\nto metals and insulators.\nρ ~ 10–5 – 106 Ω m\nσ ~ 105 – 10–6 S m–1\n\n(iii)Insulators: They have high resistivity (or low conductivity).\nρ ~ 1011 – 1019 Ω m\nσ ~ 10–11 – 10–19 S m–1\n\nThe values of ρ and σ given above are indicative of magnitude and\ncould well go outside the ranges as well. Relative values of the resistivity\nare not the only criteria for distinguishing metals, insulators and\nsemiconductors from each other. There are some other differences, which\nwill become clear as we go along in this chapter.\n\nOur interest in this chapter is in the study of semiconductors which\ncould be:\n(i) Elemental semiconductors: Si and Ge\n(ii) Compound semiconductors: Examples are:\n\n• Inorganic: CdS, GaAs, CdSe, InP, etc.\n• Organic: anthracene, doped pthalocyanines, etc.\n• Organic polymers:  polypyrrole, polyaniline, polythiophene, etc.\nMost of the currently available semiconductor devices are based on\n\nelemental semiconductors Si or Ge and compound inorganic\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n469\n\nSemiconductor Electronics:\n\nMaterials, Devices and\n\nSimple Circuits\n\nsemiconductors. However, after 1990, a few semiconductor devices using\norganic semiconductors and semiconducting polymers have been\ndeveloped signalling the birth of a futuristic technology of polymer-\nelectronics and molecular-electronics. In this chapter, we will restrict\nourselves to the study of inorganic semiconductors, particularly\nelemental semiconductors Si and Ge. The general concepts introduced\nhere for discussing the elemental semiconductors, by-and-large, apply\nto most of the compound semiconductors as well.\n\nOn the basis of energy bands\n\nAccording to the Bohr atomic model, in an isolated atom the energy of\nany of its electrons is decided by the orbit in which it revolves. But when\nthe atoms come together to form a solid they are close to each other. So\nthe outer orbits of electrons from neighbouring atoms would come very\nclose or could even overlap. This would make the nature of electron motion\nin a solid very different from that in an isolated atom.\n\nInside the crystal each electron has a unique position and no two\nelectrons see exactly the same pattern of surrounding charges. Because\nof this, each electron will have a different energy level. These different\nenergy levels with continuous energy variation form what are called\nenergy bands.  The energy band which includes the energy levels of the\nvalence electrons is called the valence band. The energy band above the\nvalence band is called the conduction band. With no external energy, all\nthe valence electrons will reside in the valence band. If the lowest level in\nthe conduction band happens to be lower than the highest level of the\nvalence band, the electrons from the valence band can easily move into\nthe conduction band. Normally the conduction band is empty. But when\nit overlaps on the valence band electrons can move freely into it. This is\nthe case with metallic conductors.\n\nIf there is some gap between the conduction band and the valence\nband, electrons in the valence band all remain bound and no free electrons\nare available in the conduction band. This makes the material an\ninsulator. But some of the electrons from the valence band may gain\nexternal energy to cross the gap between the conduction band and the\nvalence band. Then these electrons will move into the conduction band.\nAt the same time they will create vacant energy levels in the valence band\nwhere other valence electrons can move. Thus the process creates the\npossibility of conduction due to electrons in conduction band as well as\ndue to vacancies in the valence band.\n\nLet us consider what happens in the case of Si or Ge crystal containing\nN atoms. For Si, the outermost orbit is the third orbit (n = 3), while for Ge\nit is the fourth orbit (n = 4). The number of electrons in the outermost\norbit is 4 (2s and 2p electrons). Hence, the total number of outer electrons\nin the crystal is 4N. The maximum possible number of electrons in the\nouter orbit is 8 (2s + 6p electrons). So, for the 4N valence electrons there\nare 8N available energy states. These 8N discrete energy levels can either\nform a continuous band or they may be grouped in different bands\ndepending upon the distance between the atoms in the crystal (see box\non Band Theory of Solids).\n\nAt the distance between the atoms in the crystal lattices of Si and Ge,\nthe energy band of these 8N states is split apart into two which are\nseparated by an energy gap E\n\ng\n (Fig. 14.1). The lower band which is\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n470\n\ncompletely occupied by the 4N valence electrons at temperature of absolute\nzero is the valence band.  The other band consisting of 4N energy states,\ncalled the conduction band, is completely empty at absolute zero.\n\nBAND THEORY OF SOLIDS\n\nConsider that the Si or Ge crystal\ncontains N atoms. Electrons of each\natom will have discrete energies in\ndifferent orbits. The electron energy\nwill be same if all the atoms are\nisolated, i.e., separated from each\nother by a large distance. However,\nin a crystal, the atoms are close to\neach other (2 to 3 Å) and therefore\nthe electrons interact with each\nother and also with the\nneighbouring atomic cores. The\noverlap (or interaction) will be more\nfelt by the electrons in the\noutermost orbit while the inner\norbit or core electron energies may\n\nremain unaffected. Therefore, for understanding electron energies in Si or Ge crystal, we\nneed to consider the changes in the energies of the electrons in the outermost orbit only.\nFor Si, the outermost orbit is the third orbit (n = 3), while  for Ge it is the fourth orbit\n(n = 4). The number of electrons in the outermost orbit is 4 (2s and 2p electrons). Hence,\nthe total number of outer electrons in the crystal is 4N. The maximum possible number of\nouter electrons in the orbit is 8 (2s + 6p electrons). So, out of the 4N electrons, 2N electrons\nare in the 2N s-states (orbital quantum number l = 0) and 2N electrons are in the available\n6N p-states. Obviously, some p-electron states are empty as shown in the extreme right of\nFigure. This is the case of well separated or isolated atoms [region A of Figure].\n\nSuppose these atoms start coming nearer to each other to form a solid. The energies\nof these electrons in the outermost orbit may change (both increase and decrease) due to\nthe interaction between the electrons of different atoms. The 6N states for l = 1, which\noriginally had identical energies in the isolated atoms, spread out and form an energy\nband [region B in Figure]. Similarly, the 2N states for l = 0, having identical energies in\nthe isolated atoms, split into a second band (carefully see the region B of Figure) separated\nfrom the first one by an energy gap.\n\nAt still smaller spacing, however, there comes a region in which the bands merge with\neach other. The lowest energy state that is a split from the upper atomic level appears to\ndrop below the upper state that has come from the lower atomic level. In this region (region\nC in Figure), no energy gap exists where the upper and lower energy states get mixed.\n\nFinally, if the distance between the atoms further decreases, the energy bands again\nsplit apart and are separated by an energy gap E\n\ng\n (region D in Figure). The total number\n\nof available energy states 8N has been re-apportioned between the two bands (4N states\neach in the lower and upper energy bands). Here the significant point is that there are\nexactly as many states in the lower band (4N ) as there are available valence electrons\nfrom the  atoms (4N ).\n\nTherefore, this band (called the valence band ) is completely filled while the upper\nband is completely empty. The upper band is called the conduction band.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n471\n\nSemiconductor Electronics:\n\nMaterials, Devices and\n\nSimple Circuits\n\nThe lowest energy level in the\nconduction band is shown as E\n\nC\n and\n\nhighest energy level in the valence band\nis shown as E\n\nV\n. Above E\n\nC\n and below E\n\nV\n\nthere are a large number of closely spaced\nenergy levels, as shown in Fig. 14.1.\n\nThe gap between the top of the  valence\nband and bottom of the conduction band\nis called the energy band gap (Energy gap\nE\n\ng\n). It may be large, small, or zero,\n\ndepending upon the material. These\ndifferent situations, are depicted in Fig.\n14.2 and discussed below:\nCase I: This refers to a situation, as\nshown in Fig. 14.2(a). One can have a\nmetal either when the conduction band\nis partially filled and the balanced band\nis partially empty or when the conduction\nand valance bands overlap. When there\nis overlap electrons from valence band can\neasily move into the conduction band.\nThis situation makes a  large number of\nelectrons available for electrical conduction. When the valence band is\npartially empty, electrons from its lower level can move to higher level\nmaking conduction possible. Therefore, the resistance of such materials\nis low or the conductivity is high.\n\nFIGURE 14.2 Difference between energy bands of (a) metals,\n(b) insulators and (c) semiconductors.\n\nFIGURE 14.1 The energy band positions in a\nsemiconductor at 0 K. The upper band, called the\n\nconduction band, consists of infinitely large number\nof closely spaced energy states. The lower band,\n\ncalled the valence band, consists of closely spaced\ncompletely filled energy states.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n472\n\nCase II: In this case, as shown in Fig. 14.2(b), a large band gap E\ng\n exists\n\n(E\ng\n > 3 eV). There are no electrons in the conduction band, and therefore\n\nno electrical conduction is possible. Note that the energy gap is so large\nthat electrons cannot be excited from the valence band  to the conduction\nband by thermal excitation. This is the case of insulators.\nCase III: This situation is shown in Fig. 14.2(c). Here a finite but small\nband gap (E\n\ng\n < 3 eV) exists. Because of the small band gap, at room\n\ntemperature some electrons from valence band can acquire enough\nenergy to cross the energy gap and enter the  conduction band. These\nelectrons (though small in numbers) can move in the conduction band.\nHence, the resistance of semiconductors is not as high as that of the\ninsulators.\n\nIn this section we have made a broad classification of metals,\nconductors and semiconductors. In the section which follows you will\nlearn the conduction process in semiconductors.\n\n14.3  INTRINSIC SEMICONDUCTOR\nWe shall take the most common case of Ge and Si whose lattice structure\nis shown in Fig. 14.3. These structures are called the  diamond-like\nstructures. Each atom is surrounded by four nearest neighbours. We\nknow that Si and Ge have four valence electrons. In its crystalline\nstructure, every Si or Ge atom tends to share one of its four valence\nelectrons with each of its four nearest neighbour atoms, and also to take\nshare of one electron from each such neighbour. These shared electron\npairs are referred to as forming a  covalent bond or simply a valence\nbond. The two shared electrons can be assumed to shuttle back-and-\nforth between the associated atoms holding them together strongly.\nFigure 14.4 schematically shows the 2-dimensional representation of Si\nor Ge structure shown in Fig. 14.3 which overemphasises the covalent\nbond. It shows an idealised picture in which no bonds are broken (all\n\nbonds are intact). Such a situation arises at low\ntemperatures. As the temperature increases, more\nthermal energy becomes available to these electrons\nand some of these electrons may break–away\n(becoming free electrons contributing to conduction).\nThe thermal energy effectively ionises only a few atoms\nin the crystalline lattice and creates a vacancy in the\nbond as shown in Fig. 14.5(a). The neighbourhood,\nfrom which the free electron (with charge –q ) has come\nout leaves a vacancy with an effective charge (+q ). This\nvacancy with the effective positive electronic charge is\ncalled a hole. The hole behaves as an apparent free\nparticle with effective positive charge.\n\nIn intrinsic semiconductors, the number of free\nelectrons, n\n\ne \nis equal to the number of holes, n\n\nh\n.  That is\n\nn\ne\n = n\n\nh\n = n\n\ni\n(14.1)\n\nwhere n\ni\n is called intrinsic carrier concentration.\n\nSemiconductors posses the unique property in\nwhich, apart from electrons, the holes also move.\n\nFIGURE 14.3 Three-dimensional dia-\nmond-like crystal structure for Carbon,\n\nSilicon or Germanium with\nrespective lattice spacing a equal\n\nto 3.56, 5.43 and 5.66 Å.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n473\n\nSemiconductor Electronics:\n\nMaterials, Devices and\n\nSimple Circuits\n\nSuppose there is a hole at site 1 as shown in\nFig. 14.5(a). The movement of holes can be\nvisualised as shown in Fig. 14.5(b). An electron\nfrom the covalent bond at site 2 may jump to\nthe vacant site 1 (hole). Thus, after such a jump,\nthe hole is at site 2 and the site 1 has now an\nelectron. Therefore, apparently, the hole has\nmoved from site 1 to site 2. Note that the electron\noriginally set free [Fig. 14.5(a)] is not involved\nin this process of hole motion. The free electron\nmoves completely independently as conduction\nelectron and gives rise to an electron current, I\n\ne\n\nunder an applied electric field. Remember that\nthe motion of hole is only a convenient way of\ndescribing the actual motion of bound electrons,\nwhenever there is an empty bond anywhere in\nthe crystal. Under the action of an electric field,\nthese holes move towards negative potential\ngiving the hole current, I\n\nh\n. The total current, I is\n\nthus the sum of the electron current I\ne\n and the\n\nhole current I\nh\n:\n\nI = I\ne\n + I\n\nh\n(14.2)\n\nIt may be noted that apart from the process of generation of conduction\nelectrons and holes, a simultaneous process of recombination occurs in\nwhich the electrons recombine with the holes. At equilibrium, the rate of\ngeneration is equal to the rate of recombination of charge carriers. The\nrecombination occurs due to an electron colliding with a hole.\n\nFIGURE 14.4 Schematic two-dimensional\nrepresentation of Si or Ge structure showing\n\ncovalent bonds at low temperature\n(all bonds intact). +4 symbol\n\nindicates inner cores of Si or Ge.\n\nFIGURE 14.5 (a) Schematic model of generation of hole at site 1 and conduction electron\ndue to thermal energy at moderate temperatures. (b) Simplified representation of\n\npossible thermal motion of a hole. The electron from the lower left hand covalent bond\n(site 2) goes to the earlier hole site1, leaving a hole at its site indicating an\n\napparent movement of the hole from site 1 to site 2.\n\n(a) (b)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n474\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n4\n.1\n\nAn intrinsic semiconductor\nwill behave like an insulator at\nT = 0 K as shown in Fig. 14.6(a).\nIt is the thermal energy at\nhigher temperatures (T > 0K),\nwhich excites some electrons\nfrom the valence band to the\nconduction band. These\nthermally excited electrons at\nT > 0 K, partially occupy the\nconduction band. Therefore,\nthe energy-band diagram of an\nintrinsic semiconductor will be\nas shown in Fig. 14.6(b). Here,\nsome electrons are shown in\nthe conduction band. These\nhave come from the valence\nband leaving equal number of\nholes there.\n\nExample 14.1 C, Si and Ge have same lattice structure. Why is C\ninsulator while Si and Ge intrinsic semiconductors?\n\nSolution  The 4 bonding electrons of C, Si or Ge lie, respectively, in\nthe second, third and fourth orbit.  Hence, energy required to take\nout an electron from these atoms (i.e., ionisation energy E\n\ng\n) will be\n\nleast for Ge, followed by Si and highest for C. Hence, number of free\nelectrons for conduction in Ge and Si are significant but negligibly\nsmall for C.\n\n14.4  EXTRINSIC SEMICONDUCTOR\nThe conductivity of an intrinsic semiconductor depends on its\ntemperature, but at room temperature its conductivity is very low. As\nsuch, no important electronic devices can be developed using these\nsemiconductors. Hence there is a necessity of improving their\nconductivity. This can be done by making use of impurities.\n\nWhen a small amount, say, a few parts per million (ppm), of a suitable\nimpurity is added to the pure semiconductor, the conductivity of the\nsemiconductor is increased manifold. Such materials are known as\nextrinsic semiconductors or impurity semiconductors. The deliberate\naddition of a desirable impurity is called doping and the impurity atoms\nare called dopants. Such a material is also called a doped semiconductor.\nThe dopant has to be such that it does not distort the original pure\nsemiconductor lattice. It occupies only a very few of the original\nsemiconductor atom sites in the crystal. A necessary condition to attain\nthis is that the sizes of the dopant and the semiconductor atoms should\nbe nearly the same.\n\nThere are two types of dopants used in doping the tetravalent Si\nor Ge:\n(i) Pentavalent (valency 5); like Arsenic (As), Antimony (Sb), Phosphorous\n\n(P), etc.\n\nFIGURE 14.6 (a)  An intrinsic semiconductor at T = 0 K\nbehaves like insulator. (b)  At T > 0 K, four thermally generated\n\nelectron-hole pairs. The filled circles ( ) represent electrons\nand empty circles ( ) represent holes.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n475\n\nSemiconductor Electronics:\n\nMaterials, Devices and\n\nSimple Circuits\n\n(ii) Trivalent (valency 3); like Indium (In),\nBoron (B), Aluminium (Al), etc.\nWe shall now discuss how the doping\n\nchanges the number of charge carriers (and\nhence the conductivity) of semiconductors.\nSi or Ge belongs to the fourth group in the\nPeriodic table and, therefore, we choose the\ndopant element from nearby fifth or third\ngroup, expecting and taking care that the\nsize of the dopant atom is nearly the same as\nthat of Si or Ge. Interestingly, the pentavalent\nand trivalent dopants in Si or Ge give two\nentirely different types of semiconductors as\ndiscussed below.\n\n(i)  n-type semiconductor\n\nSuppose we dope Si or Ge with a pentavalent\nelement as shown in Fig. 14.7. When an atom\nof  +5 valency element  occupies the position\nof an atom in the crystal lattice of Si, four of\nits electrons bond with the four silicon\nneighbours while the fifth remains very\nweakly bound to its parent atom. This is\nbecause the four electrons participating in\nbonding are seen as part of the effective core\nof the atom by the fifth electron. As a result\nthe ionisation energy required to set this\nelectron free is very small and even at room\ntemperature it will be free to move in the\nlattice of the semiconductor. For example, the\nenergy required is ~ 0.01 eV for germanium,\nand 0.05 eV for silicon, to separate this\nelectron from its atom. This is in contrast to the energy required to jump\nthe forbidden band (about 0.72 eV for germanium and about 1.1 eV for\nsilicon) at room temperature in the intrinsic semiconductor.  Thus, the\npentavalent dopant is donating one extra electron for conduction and\nhence is known as donor impurity. The number of electrons made\navailable for conduction by dopant atoms depends strongly upon the\ndoping level and is independent of any increase in ambient temperature.\nOn the other hand, the number of free electrons (with an equal number\nof holes) generated by Si atoms, increases weakly with temperature.\n\nIn a doped semiconductor the total number of conduction electrons\nn\n\ne\n is due to the electrons contributed by donors and those generated\n\nintrinsically, while the total number of holes n\nh\n is only due to the holes\n\nfrom the intrinsic source. But the rate of recombination of holes would\nincrease due to the increase in the number of electrons. As a result, the\nnumber of holes would get reduced further.\n\nThus, with proper level of doping the number of conduction electrons\ncan be made much larger than the number of holes. Hence in an extrinsic\n\nFIGURE 14.7 (a) Pentavalent donor atom (As, Sb,\nP, etc.) doped for tetravalent Si or Ge giving n-\ntype semiconductor, and (b) Commonly used\nschematic representation of n-type material\n\nwhich shows only the fixed cores of the\nsubstituent donors with one additional effective\npositive charge and its associated extra electron.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n476\n\nsemiconductor doped with pentavalent impurity, electrons\nbecome the majority carriers and holes the minority carriers.\nThese semiconductors are, therefore, known as n-type\nsemiconductors. For n-type semiconductors, we have,\n\nn\ne\n >> n\n\nh\n(14.3)\n\n(ii)  p-type semiconductor\n\nThis is obtained when Si or Ge is doped with a trivalent impurity\nlike Al, B, In, etc. The dopant has one valence electron less than\nSi or Ge and, therefore, this atom can form covalent bonds with\nneighbouring three Si atoms but does not have any electron to\noffer to the fourth Si atom. So the bond between the fourth\nneighbour and the trivalent atom has a vacancy or hole as shown\nin Fig. 14.8. Since the neighbouring Si atom in the lattice wants\nan electron in place of a hole, an electron  in the outer orbit of\nan atom in the neighbourhood may jump to fill this vacancy,\nleaving a vacancy or hole at its own site. Thus the hole is\navailable for conduction. Note that the trivalent foreign atom\nbecomes effectively negatively charged when it shares fourth\nelectron with neighbouring Si atom. Therefore, the dopant atom\nof p-type material can be treated as core of one negative charge\nalong with its associated hole as shown in Fig. 14.8(b). It is\nobvious that one acceptor atom gives one hole. These holes are\nin addition to the intrinsically generated holes while the source\nof conduction electrons is only intrinsic generation. Thus, for\nsuch a material, the holes are the majority carriers and electrons\nare minority carriers. Therefore, extrinsic semiconductors doped\nwith trivalent impurity are called p-type semiconductors. For\np-type semiconductors, the recombination process will reduce\nthe number (n\n\ni\n)of intrinsically generated electrons to n\n\ne\n.  We\n\nhave, for p-type semiconductors\n\nn\nh\n >> n\n\ne\n(14.4)\n\nNote that the crystal maintains an overall charge neutrality\nas the charge of additional charge carriers is just equal and\n\nopposite to that of the ionised cores in the lattice.\n\nIn extrinsic semiconductors, because of the abundance of\nmajority current carriers, the minority carriers produced\nthermally have more chance of meeting majority carriers and\n\nthus getting destroyed. Hence, the dopant, by adding a large number of\ncurrent carriers of one type, which become the majority carriers, indirectly\nhelps to reduce the intrinsic concentration of minority carriers.\n\nThe semiconductor’s energy band structure is affected by doping. In\nthe case of extrinsic semiconductors, additional energy states due to donor\nimpurities (E\n\nD\n) and acceptor impurities (E\n\nA\n) also exist. In the energy band\n\ndiagram of n-type Si semiconductor, the donor energy level E\nD\n is slightly\n\nbelow the bottom E\nC\n of the conduction band and electrons from this level\n\nmove into the conduction band with very small supply of energy. At room\ntemperature, most of the donor atoms get ionised but very few (~1012)\natoms of Si get ionised.  So the conduction band will have most electrons\ncoming from the donor impurities, as shown in Fig. 14.9(a). Similarly,\n\nFIGURE 14.8 (a) Trivalent\nacceptor atom (In, Al, B etc.)\ndoped in tetravalent Si or Ge\nlattice giving p-type semicon-\nductor.

With very small\n\nsupply of energy an electron from the valence band can jump to the level\nE\n\nA\n and ionise the acceptor negatively. (Alternately, we can also say that\n\nwith very small supply of energy the hole from level E\nA\n sinks down into\n\nthe valence band. Electrons rise up and holes fall down when they gain\nexternal energy.) At room temperature, most of the acceptor atoms get\nionised leaving holes in the valence band. Thus at room temperature the\ndensity of holes in the valence band is predominantly due to impurity in\nthe extrinsic semiconductor. The electron and hole concentration in a\nsemiconductor in thermal equilibrium is given by\n\nn\ne\nn\n\nh\n = n\n\ni\n\n2 (14.5)\n\nThough the above description is grossly approximate and\nhypothetical, it helps in understanding the difference between metals,\ninsulators and semiconductors (extrinsic and intrinsic) in a simple\nmanner. The difference in the resistivity of C, Si and Ge depends upon\nthe energy gap between their conduction and valence bands. For C\n(diamond), Si and Ge, the energy gaps are 5.4 eV, 1.1 eV and 0.7 eV,\nrespectively. Sn also is a group IV element but it is a metal because the\nenergy gap in its case  is 0 eV.\n\nFIGURE 14.9 Energy bands of (a) n-type semiconductor at T > 0K, (b) p-type\nsemiconductor at T > 0K.\n\nExample 14.2 Suppose a pure Si crystal has 5 × 1028 atoms m–3.

By adding\nprecisely a small quantity of pentavelent impurity, part of the p-Si wafer\ncan be converted into n-Si. There are several processes by which a\nsemiconductor can be formed. The wafer now contains p-region and\nn-region and a metallurgical junction between p-, and n- region.\n\nTwo important processes occur during the formation of a p-n junction:\ndiffusion and drift. We know that in an n-type semiconductor, the\nconcentration of electrons (number of electrons per unit volume) is more\ncompared to the concentration of holes. Similarly, in a p-type\nsemiconductor, the concentration of holes is more than the concentration\nof electrons. During the formation of p-n junction, and due to the\nconcentration gradient across p-, and n- sides, holes diffuse from p-side\nto n-side (p → n) and electrons diffuse from n-side to p-side (n → p). This\nmotion of charge carries gives rise to diffusion current across the junction.\n\nWhen an electron diffuses from n → p, it leaves behind an ionised\ndonor on n-side. This ionised donor (positive charge) is immobile as it is\nbonded to the surrounding atoms. As the electrons continue to diffuse\nfrom n → p, a layer of positive charge (or positive space-charge region) on\nn-side of the junction is developed.\n\nSimilarly, when a hole diffuses from p → n due to the concentration\ngradient, it leaves behind an ionised acceptor (negative charge) which is\nimmobile. As the holes continue to diffuse, a layer of negative charge (or\nnegative space-charge region) on the p-side of the junction is developed.\nThis space-charge region on either side of the junction together is known\nas depletion region as the electrons and holes  taking part in the initial\n\nmovement across the junction depleted the region of its\nfree charges (Fig. 14.10). The thickness of depletion region\nis of the order of one-tenth of a micrometre. Due to the\npositive space-charge region on n-side of the junction and\nnegative space charge region on p-side of the junction,\nan electric field directed from positive charge towards\nnegative charge develops. Due to this field, an electron on\np-side of the junction moves to n-side and a hole on n-\nside of the junction moves to p-side. The motion of charge\ncarriers due to the electric field is called drift.  Thus a\ndrift current, which is opposite in direction to the diffusion\ncurrent (Fig. 14.10) starts.\n\nFIGURE 14.10 p-n junction\nformation process.\n\nF\no\n\nrm\na\nti\no\nn\n a\n\nn\nd\n w\n\no\nrk\n\nin\ng\n\n o\nf \n\np\n-n\n\n j\nu\nn\nc\nti\no\nn\n d\n\nio\nd\ne\n\nh\ntt\np\n:/\n/h\n\ny\np\ne\nrp\n\nh\ny\nsi\n\nc\ns.\n\np\nh\ny\n-a\n\nst\nr.\ng\nsu\n\n.e\nd\nu\n/h\n\nb\na\nse\n\n/s\no\nli\nd\ns/\n\np\nn\nju\n\nn\n.h\n\ntm\nl\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n479\n\nSemiconductor Electronics:\n\nMaterials, Devices and\n\nSimple Circuits\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n4\n.3\n\nInitially, diffusion current is large and drift current is small.\nAs the diffusion process continues, the space-charge regions\non either side of the junction extend, thus increasing the electric\nfield strength  and hence drift current. This process continues\nuntil the diffusion current equals the drift current. Thus a p-n\njunction is formed. In a p-n junction under equilibrium there\nis no net current.\n\nThe loss of electrons from the n-region and the gain of\nelectron by the p-region causes a  difference of potential across\nthe junction of the two regions. The polarity of this potential is\nsuch as to oppose further flow of carriers so that a condition of\nequilibrium exists. Figure 14.11 shows the p-n junction at\nequilibrium and the potential across the junction. The\nn-material has lost electrons, and p material has acquired\nelectrons. The n material is thus positive relative to the p\nmaterial. Since this potential tends to prevent the movement of\nelectron from the n region into the p region, it is often called a\nbarrier potential.\n\nExample 14.3  Can we take one slab of p-type semiconductor and\nphysically join it to another n-type semiconductor to get p-n junction?\n\nSolution  No! Any slab, howsoever flat, will have roughness much\nlarger than the inter-atomic crystal spacing (~2 to 3 Å) and hence\ncontinuous contact at the atomic level will not be possible. The junction\nwill behave as a discontinuity for the flowing charge carriers.\n\n14.6  SEMICONDUCTOR DIODE\nA semiconductor diode [Fig. 14.12(a)] is basically a\np-n junction with metallic contacts provided at the\nends for the application of an external voltage. It is a\ntwo terminal device. A p-n junction diode is\nsymbolically represented as shown in Fig. 14.12(b).\n\nThe direction of arrow indicates the conventional\ndirection of current (when the diode is under forward\nbias). The equilibrium barrier potential can be altered\nby applying an external voltage V across the diode.\nThe situation of p-n junction diode under equilibrium\n(without bias) is shown in Fig. 14.11(a) and (b).\n\n14.6.1  p-n junction diode under forward bias\n\nWhen an external voltage V is applied across a semiconductor diode such\nthat p-side is connected to the positive terminal of the battery and n-side\nto the negative terminal [Fig. 14.13(a)], it is said to be forward biased.\n\nThe applied voltage mostly drops across the depletion region and the\nvoltage drop across the p-side and n-side of the junction is negligible.\n(This is because the resistance of the depletion region – a region where\nthere are no charges – is very high compared to the resistance of  n-side\nand p-side.) The direction of the applied voltage (V ) is opposite to the\n\nFIGURE 14.11 (a) Diode under\nequilibrium (V = 0), (b) Barrier\n\npotential under no bias.\n\nFIGURE 14.12 (a) Semiconductor diode,\n(b) Symbol for p-n junction diode.\n\nnp\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n480\n\nbuilt-in potential V\n0\n. As a result, the depletion layer width\n\ndecreases and the barrier height is reduced [Fig. 14.13(b)]. The\neffective barrier height under forward bias is (V\n\n0\n – V ).\n\nIf the applied voltage is small, the barrier potential will be\nreduced only slightly below the equilibrium value, and only a\nsmall number of carriers in the material—those that happen to\nbe in the uppermost energy levels—will possess enough energy\nto cross the junction. So the current will be small. If we increase\nthe applied voltage significantly, the barrier height will be reduced\nand more number of carriers will have the required energy. Thus\nthe current increases.\n\nDue to the applied voltage, electrons from n-side cross the\ndepletion region and reach p-side (where they are minority\ncarries). Similarly, holes from p-side cross the junction and reach\nthe n-side (where they are minority carries). This process under\nforward bias is known as minority carrier injection. At the\njunction boundary, on each side, the minority carrier\nconcentration increases significantly compared to the locations\nfar from the junction.\n\nDue to this concentration gradient, the injected electrons on\np-side diffuse from the junction edge of p-side to the other end\nof p-side. Likewise, the injected holes on n-side diffuse from the\n\njunction edge of n-side to the other end of n-side\n(Fig. 14.14). This motion of charged carriers on either side\ngives rise to current. The total diode forward current is sum\nof hole diffusion current and conventional current due to\nelectron diffusion. The magnitude of this current is usually\nin mA.\n\n14.6.2  p-n junction diode under reverse bias\n\nWhen an external voltage (V ) is applied across the diode such\nthat n-side is positive and p-side is negative, it is said to be\nreverse biased [Fig.14.15(a)]. The applied voltage mostly\n\ndrops across the depletion region. The direction of applied voltage is same\nas the direction of barrier potential. As a result, the barrier height increases\nand the depletion region widens due to the change in the electric field.\nThe effective barrier height under reverse bias is (V0 + V ), [Fig. 14.15(b)].\nThis suppresses the flow of electrons from n → p and holes from p → n.\nThus, diffusion current, decreases enormously compared to the diode\nunder forward bias.\n\nThe electric field direction of the junction is such that if electrons on\np-side or holes on n-side in their random motion come close to the\njunction, they will be swept to its majority zone. This drift of carriers\ngives rise to current. The drift current is of the order of a few µA. This is\nquite low because it is due to the motion of carriers from their minority\nside to their majority side across the junction. The drift current is also\nthere under forward bias but it is negligible (µA) when compared with\ncurrent due to injected carriers which is usually in mA.\n\nThe diode reverse current is not very much dependent on the applied\nvoltage. Even a small voltage is sufficient to sweep the minority carriers\nfrom one side of the junction to the other side of the junction. The current\n\nFIGURE 14.13 (a) p-n\njunction diode under forward\n\nbias, (b) Barrier potential\n(1) without battery, (2) Low\n\nbattery voltage, and (3) High\nvoltage battery.\n\nFIGURE 14.14 Forward bias\nminority carrier injection.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n481\n\nSemiconductor Electronics:\n\nMaterials, Devices and\n\nSimple Circuits\n\nis not limited by the magnitude of the applied voltage but is\nlimited due to the concentration of the minority carrier on either\nside of the junction.\n\nThe current under reverse bias is essentially voltage\nindependent upto a critical reverse bias voltage, known as\nbreakdown voltage (V\n\nbr\n). When V = V\n\nbr\n, the diode reverse current\n\nincreases sharply. Even a slight increase in the bias voltage causes\nlarge change in the current. If the reverse current is not limited by\nan external circuit below the rated value (specified by the\nmanufacturer) the p-n junction will get destroyed. Once it exceeds\nthe rated value, the diode gets destroyed due to overheating. This\ncan happen even for the diode under forward bias, if the forward\ncurrent exceeds the rated value.\n\nThe circuit arrangement for studying the V-I characteristics\nof a diode, (i.e., the variation of current as a function of applied\nvoltage) are shown in Fig. 14.16(a) and (b). The battery is connected\nto the diode through a potentiometer (or reheostat) so that the\napplied voltage to the diode can be changed. For different values\nof voltages, the value of the current is noted. A graph between V\nand I is obtained as in Fig. 14.16(c). Note that in forward bias\nmeasurement, we use a milliammeter since the expected current is large\n(as explained in the earlier section) while a micrometer is used in reverse\nbias to measure the current. You can see in Fig. 14.16(c) that in forward\n\nFIGURE 14.15 (a) Diode\nunder reverse bias,\n\n(b) Barrier potential under\nreverse bias.\n\nFIGURE 14.16 Experimental circuit arrangement for studying V-I characteristics of\na p-n junction diode (a) in forward bias, (b) in reverse bias.

After the characteristic\nvoltage, the diode current increases significantly (exponentially), even for\na very small increase in the diode bias voltage. This voltage is called the\nthreshold voltage or cut-in voltage (~0.2V for germanium diode and\n~0.7 V for silicon diode).\n\nFor the diode in reverse bias, the current is very small (~µA) and almost\nremains constant with change in bias. It is called reverse saturation\ncurrent. However, for special cases, at very high reverse bias (break down\nvoltage), the current suddenly increases. This special action of the diode\nis discussed later in Section 14.8. The general purpose diode are not\nused beyond the reverse saturation current region.\n\nThe above discussion shows that the p-n junction diode primerly\nallows the flow of current only in one direction (forward bias). The forward\nbias resistance is low as compared to the reverse bias resistance. This\nproperty is used for rectification of ac voltages as discussed in the next\nsection. For diodes, we define a quantity called dynamic resistance as\nthe ratio of small change in voltage ∆V to a small change in current ∆I:\n\nd\n\nV\nr\n\nI\n\n∆\n=\n\n∆\n(14.6)\n\nExample 14.4 The V-I characteristic of a silicon diode is shown in\nthe Fig. 14.17.

So if an alternating voltage is\napplied across a diode the current flows only in that part of the cycle\nwhen the diode is forward biased. This property\nis used to rectify alternating voltages and the\ncircuit used for this purpose is called a rectifier.\n\nIf an alternating voltage is applied across a\ndiode in series with a load, a pulsating voltage will\nappear across the load only during the half cycles\nof the ac input during which the diode is forward\nbiased. Such rectifier circuit, as shown in\nFig. 14.18, is called a half-wave rectifier. The\nsecondary of a transformer supplies the desired\nac voltage across terminals A and B. When the\nvoltage at A is positive, the diode is forward biased\nand it conducts. When A is negative, the diode is\nreverse-biased and it does not conduct. The reverse\nsaturation current of a diode is negligible and can\nbe considered equal to zero for practical purposes.\n(The reverse breakdown voltage of the diode must\nbe sufficiently higher than the peak ac voltage at\nthe secondary of the transformer to protect the\ndiode from reverse breakdown.)\n\nTherefore, in the positive half-cycle of ac there\nis a current through the load resistor R\n\nL\n and we\n\nget an output voltage, as shown in Fig. 14.18(b),\nwhereas there is no current in the negative half-\ncycle. In the next positive half-cycle, again we get\nthe output voltage. Thus, the output voltage, though still varying, is\nrestricted to only one direction and is said to be rectified. Since the\nrectified output of this circuit is only for half of the input ac wave it is\ncalled as half-wave rectifier.\n\nThe circuit using two diodes, shown in Fig. 14.19(a), gives output\nrectified voltage corresponding to both the positive as well as negative\nhalf of the ac cycle. Hence, it is known as full-wave rectifier. Here the\np-side of the two diodes are connected to the ends of the secondary of the\ntransformer. The n-side of the diodes are connected together and the\noutput is taken between this common point of diodes and the midpoint\nof the secondary of the transformer. So for a full-wave rectifier the\nsecondary of the transformer is provided with a centre tapping and so it\nis called centre-tap transformer. As can be seen from Fig.14.19(c) the\nvoltage rectified by each diode is only half the total secondary voltage.\nEach diode rectifies only for half the cycle, but the two do so for alternate\ncycles. Thus, the output between their common terminals and the centre-\ntap of the transformer becomes a full-wave rectifier output. (Note that\nthere is another circuit of full wave rectifier which does not need a centre-\ntap transformer but needs four diodes.) Suppose the input voltage to A\n\nFIGURE 14.18 (a) Half-wave rectifier\ncircuit, (b) Input ac voltage and output\n\nvoltage waveforms from the rectifier circuit.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n484\n\nwith respect to the centre tap at any instant\nis positive. It is clear that, at that instant,\nvoltage at B being out of phase will be\nnegative as shown in Fig.14.19(b). So, diode\nD1 gets forward biased and conducts (while\nD\n\n2\n being reverse biased is not conducting).\n\nHence, during this positive half cycle we get\nan output current (and a output voltage\nacross the load resistor R\n\nL\n) as shown in\n\nFig.14.19(c). In the course of the ac cycle\nwhen the voltage at A becomes negative with\nrespect to centre tap, the voltage at B would\nbe positive. In this part of the cycle diode\nD\n\n1\n would not conduct but diode D\n\n2\n would,\n\ngiving an output current and output\nvoltage (across R\n\nL\n) during the negative half\n\ncycle of the input ac. Thus, we get output\nvoltage during both the positive as well as\nthe negative half of the cycle. Obviously,\nthis is a more efficient circuit for getting\nrectified voltage or current than the half-\nwave rectifier.\n\nThe rectified voltage is in the form of\npulses of the shape of half sinusoids.\nThough it is unidirectional it does not have\na steady value. To get steady dc output\nfrom the pulsating voltage normally a\ncapacitor is connected across the output\nterminals (parallel to the load R\n\nL\n). One can\n\nalso use an inductor in series with R\nL\n for\n\nthe same purpose. Since these additional\ncircuits appear to filter out the ac ripple\nand give a pure dc voltage, so they are\ncalled filters.\n\nNow we shall discuss the role of\ncapacitor in filtering. When the voltage\nacross the capacitor is rising, it gets\n\ncharged. If there is no external load, it remains charged to the peak voltage\nof the rectified output. When there is a load, it gets discharged through\nthe load and the voltage across it begins to fall. In the next half-cycle of\nrectified output it again gets charged to the peak value (Fig. 14.20). The\nrate of fall of the voltage across the capacitor depends inversely upon the\nproduct of capacitance C and the effective resistance R\n\nL\n used in the circuit\n\nand is called the time constant.  To make the time constant large value of\nC should be large. So capacitor input filters use large capacitors. The\noutput voltage obtained by using capacitor input filter is nearer to the\npeak voltage of the rectified voltage. This type of filter is most widely\nused in power supplies.\n\nFIGURE 14.19 (a) A Full-wave rectifier\ncircuit; (b) Input wave forms given to the\ndiode D1 at A and to the diode D2 at B;\n\n(c) Output waveform across the\nload R\n\nL\n connected in the full-wave\n\nrectifier circuit.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n485\n\nSemiconductor Electronics:\n\nMaterials, Devices and\n\nSimple Circuits\n\n14.8  SPECIAL PURPOSE p-n JUNCTION DIODES\nIn the section, we shall discuss some devices which are basically junction\ndiodes but are developed for different applications.\n\n14.8.1  Zener diode\n\nIt is a special purpose semiconductor diode, named after its inventor\nC. Zener. It is designed to operate under reverse bias in the breakdown\nregion and used as a voltage regulator. The symbol for Zener diode is\nshown in Fig. 14.21(a).\n\nZener diode is fabricated by heavily doping both p-, and\nn- sides of the junction. Due to this, depletion region formed\nis very thin (<10–6 m) and the electric field of the junction is\nextremely high (~5×106 V/m) even for a small reverse bias\nvoltage of about 5V. The I-V characteristics of a Zener diode is\nshown in Fig. 14.21(b). It is seen that when the applied reverse\nbias voltage(V ) reaches the breakdown voltage (V\n\nz\n) of the Zener\n\ndiode, there is a large change in the current. Note that after\nthe breakdown voltage V\n\nz\n, a large change in the current can\n\nbe produced by almost insignificant change in the reverse bias\nvoltage. In other words, Zener voltage remains constant, even\nthough current through the Zener diode varies over a wide\nrange. This property of the Zener diode is used for regulating\nsupply voltages so that they are constant.\n\nLet us understand how reverse current suddenly increases\nat the breakdown voltage. We know that reverse current is\ndue to the flow of electrons (minority carriers) from p → n and\nholes from n → p. As the reverse bias voltage is increased, the\nelectric field at the junction becomes significant. When the\nreverse bias voltage V =  V\n\nz\n, then the electric field strength is\n\nhigh enough to pull valence electrons from the host atoms on\nthe p-side which are accelerated to n-side. These electrons\naccount for high current observed at the breakdown. The\nemission of electrons from the host atoms due to the high\nelectric field is known as internal field emission or field\nionisation. The electric field required for field ionisation is of\nthe order of 106 V/m.\n\nFIGURE 14.20 (a) A full-wave rectifier with capacitor filter, (b) Input and output\nvoltage of rectifier in (a).\n\nFIGURE 14.21 Zener diode,\n(a) symbol, (b) I-V\ncharacteristics.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n486\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n4\n.5\n\nFIGURE 14.22 Zener diode as DC\nvoltage regulator\n\nZener diode as a voltage regulator\n\nWe know that when the ac input voltage of a rectifier fluctuates, its rectified\noutput also fluctuates. To get a constant dc voltage from the dc\nunregulated output of a rectifier, we use a Zener diode. The circuit diagram\nof a voltage regulator using a Zener diode is shown in Fig. 14.22.\n\nThe unregulated dc voltage (filtered output of a\nrectifier) is connected to the Zener diode through a series\nresistance R\n\ns\n such that the Zener diode is reverse biased.\n\nIf the input voltage increases, the current through R\ns\n\nand Zener diode also increases. This increases the\nvoltage drop across R\n\ns\n without any change in the\n\nvoltage across the Zener diode. This is because in the\nbreakdown region, Zener voltage remains constant even\nthough the current through the Zener diode changes.\nSimilarly, if the input voltage decreases, the current\nthrough R\n\ns\n and Zener diode also decreases. The voltage\n\ndrop across R\ns\n decreases without any change in the\n\nvoltage across the Zener diode. Thus any increase/\ndecrease in the input voltage results in, increase/\ndecrease of the voltage drop across R\n\ns\n without any\n\nchange in voltage across the Zener diode. Thus the Zener diode acts as a\nvoltage regulator. We have to select the Zener diode according to the\nrequired output voltage and accordingly the series resistance R\n\ns\n.\n\nExample 14.5 In a Zener regulated power supply a Zener diode with\nV\n\nZ\n = 6.0 V is used for regulation. The load current is to be 4.0 mA and\n\nthe unregulated input is 10.0 V. What should be the value of series\nresistor R\n\nS\n?\n\nSolution\nThe value of R\n\nS\n should be such that the current through the Zener\n\ndiode is much larger than the load current. This is to have good load\nregulation. Choose Zener current as five times the load current, i.e.,\nIZ = 20 mA. The total current through RS is, therefore, 24 mA. The\nvoltage drop across R\n\nS\n  is 10.0 – 6.0 = 4.0 V. This gives\n\nR\nS\n = 4.0V/(24 × 10–3) A = 167 Ω. The nearest value of carbon resistor\n\nis 150 Ω. So, a series resistor of 150 Ω is appropriate. Note that slight\nvariation in the value of the resistor does not matter, what is important\nis that the current IZ should be sufficiently larger than IL.\n\n14.8.2  Optoelectronic junction devices\n\nWe have seen so far, how a semiconductor diode behaves under applied\nelectrical inputs. In this section, we learn about semiconductor diodes in\nwhich carriers are generated by photons (photo-excitation). All these\ndevices are called optoelectronic devices. We shall study the functioning\nof the following optoelectronic devices:\n(i) Photodiodes used for detecting optical signal (photodetectors).\n(ii) Light emitting diodes (LED) which convert electrical energy into light.\n(iii) Photovoltaic devices which convert optical radiation into electricity\n\n(solar cells).\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n487\n\nSemiconductor Electronics:\n\nMaterials, Devices and\n\nSimple Circuits\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n4\n.6\n\n(i) Photodiode\n\nA Photodiode is again a special purpose p-n\njunction diode fabricated with a transparent\nwindow to allow light to fall on the diode. It is\noperated under reverse bias. When the photodiode\nis illuminated with light (photons) with energy (hν)\ngreater than the energy gap (E\n\ng\n) of the\n\nsemiconductor, then electron-hole pairs are\ngenerated due to the absorption of photons. The\ndiode is fabricated such that the generation of\ne-h pairs takes place in or near the depletion region\nof the diode. Due to electric field of the junction,\nelectrons and holes are separated before they\nrecombine. The direction of the electric field is such\nthat electrons reach n-side and holes reach p-side.\nElectrons are collected on n-side and holes are\ncollected on p-side giving rise to an emf. When an\nexternal load is connected, current flows. The\nmagnitude of the photocurrent depends on the\nintensity of incident light (photocurrent is\nproportional to incident light intensity).\n\nIt is easier to observe the change in the current\nwith change in the light intensity, if a reverse bias\nis applied. Thus photodiode can be used as a\nphotodetector to detect optical signals. The circuit\ndiagram used for the measurement of I-V\ncharacteristics of a photodiode is shown in\nFig. 14.23(a) and a typical I-V characteristics in\nFig. 14.23(b).\n\nExample 14.6 The current in the forward bias is known to be more\n(~mA) than the current in the reverse bias (~µA). What is the reason\nthen to operate the photodiodes in reverse bias?\n\nSolution Consider the case of an n-type semiconductor. Obviously,\nthe majority carrier density (n) is considerably larger than the minority\nhole density p (i.e., n >> p). On illumination, let the excess electrons\nand holes generated be ∆n and ∆p, respectively:\n\nn′ = n + ∆n\n\n  p′ = p + ∆p\n\nHere n′ and p′ are the electron and hole concentrations* at any\nparticular illumination and n and p are carriers concentration when\nthere is no illumination. Remember ∆n = ∆p and n >> p. Hence, the\n\nFIGURE 14.23 (a) An illuminated\nphotodiode under reverse bias , (b) I-V\n\ncharacteristics of a photodiode for different\nillumination intensity I4 > I3 > I2 > I1.\n\n* Note that, to create an e-h pair, we spend some energy (photoexcitation, thermal\nexcitation, etc.). Therefore when an electron and hole recombine the energy is\nreleased in the form of light (radiative recombination) or heat (non-radiative\nrecombination). It depends on semiconductor and the method of fabrication of\nthe p-n junction. For the fabrication of LEDs, semiconductors like GaAs, GaAs-\nGaP are used in which radiative recombination dominates.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n488\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n4\n.6\n\nfractional change in the majority carriers (i.e., ∆n/n ) would be much\nless than that in the minority carriers (i.e., ∆p/p). In general, we can\nstate that the fractional change due to the photo-effects on the\nminority carrier dominated reverse bias current is more easily\nmeasurable than the fractional change in the forward bias current.\nHence, photodiodes are preferably used in the reverse bias condition\nfor measuring light intensity.\n\n(ii) Light emitting diode\n\nIt is a heavily doped p-n junction which under forward bias emits\nspontaneous radiation. The diode is encapsulated with a transparent\ncover so that emitted light can come out.\n\nWhen the diode is forward biased, electrons are sent from n → p (where\nthey are minority carriers) and holes are sent from p → n (where they are\nminority carriers). At the junction boundary the concentration of minority\ncarriers increases compared to the equilibrium concentration (i.e., when\nthere is no bias). Thus at the junction boundary on either side of the\njunction, excess minority carriers are there which recombine with majority\ncarriers near the junction. On recombination, the energy is released in\nthe form of  photons. Photons with energy equal to or slightly less than\nthe band gap are emitted. When the forward current of the diode is small,\nthe intensity of light emitted is small. As the forward current increases,\nintensity of light increases and reaches a maximum. Further increase in\nthe forward current results in decrease of light intensity. LEDs are biased\nsuch that the light emitting efficiency is maximum.\n\nThe V-I characteristics of a LED is similar to that of a Si junction\ndiode. But the threshold voltages are much higher and slightly different\nfor each colour. The reverse breakdown voltages of LEDs are very low,\ntypically around 5V. So care should be taken that high reverse voltages\ndo not appear across them.\n\nLEDs that can emit red, yellow, orange, green and blue light are\ncommercially available. The semiconductor used for fabrication of visible\nLEDs must at least have a band gap of 1.8 eV (spectral range of visible\nlight is from about 0.4 µm to 0.7 µm, i.e., from about 3 eV to 1.8 eV). The\ncompound semiconductor Gallium Arsenide – Phosphide (GaAs1–xPx) is\nused for making LEDs of different colours. GaAs0.6 P0.4 (Eg ~ 1.9 eV) is\nused for red LED. GaAs (E\n\ng\n ~ 1.4 eV) is used for making infrared LED.\n\nThese LEDs find extensive use in remote controls, burglar alarm systems,\noptical communication, etc. Extensive research is being done for\ndeveloping white LEDs which can replace incandescent lamps.\n\nLEDs have the following advantages over conventional incandescent\nlow power lamps:\n(i) Low operational voltage and less power.\n(ii) Fast action and no warm-up time required.\n(iii) The bandwidth of emitted light is 100 Å to 500 Å or in other words it\n\nis nearly (but not exactly) monochromatic.\n(iv) Long life and ruggedness.\n(v) Fast on-off switching capability.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n489\n\nSemiconductor Electronics:\n\nMaterials, Devices and\n\nSimple Circuits\n\n(iii) Solar cell\n\nA solar cell is basically a p-n junction which\ngenerates emf when solar radiation falls on the\np-n junction. It works on the same principle\n(photovoltaic effect) as the photodiode, except that\nno external bias is applied and the junction area\nis kept much larger for solar radiation to be\nincident because we are interested in more power.\n\nA simple p-n junction solar cell is shown in\nFig. 14.24.\n\nA p-Si wafer of about 300 µm is taken over\nwhich a thin layer (~0.3 µm) of n-Si is grown on\none-side by diffusion process. The other side of\np-Si is coated with a metal (back contact). On the\ntop of n-Si layer, metal finger electrode (or metallic\ngrid) is deposited. This acts as a front contact. The\nmetallic grid occupies only a very small fraction\nof the cell area (<15%) so that light can be incident\non the cell from the top.\n\nThe generation of emf by a solar cell, when light falls on, it is due to\nthe following three basic processes: generation, separation and collection—\n(i) generation of e-h pairs due to light (with hν > E\n\ng\n)\n\nclose to the junction; (ii) separation of electrons and\nholes due to electric field of the depletion region.\nElectrons are swept to n-side and holes to p-side;\n(iii) the electrons reaching the n-side are collected by\nthe front contact and holes reaching p-side are collected\nby the back contact. Thus p-side becomes positive and\nn-side becomes negative giving rise to photovoltage.\n\nWhen an external load is connected as shown in\nthe Fig. 14.25(a) a photocurrent I\n\nL\n flows through the\n\nload. A typical I-V characteristics of a solar cell is shown\nin the Fig. 14.25(b).\n\nNote that the I – V characteristics of solar cell is\ndrawn in the fourth quadrant of the coordinate axes.\nThis is because a solar cell does not draw current but\nsupplies the same to the load.\n\nSemiconductors with band gap close to 1.5 eV are\nideal materials for solar cell fabrication. Solar cells are\nmade with semiconductors like  Si (E\n\ng\n = 1.1 eV), GaAs\n\n(Eg = 1.43 eV), CdTe (Eg = 1.45 eV), CuInSe2 (Eg = 1.04\neV), etc. The important criteria for the selection of a\nmaterial for solar cell fabrication are (i) band gap (~1.0\nto 1.8 eV), (ii) high optical absorption (~104 cm–1), (iii)\nelectrical conductivity, (iv) availability of the raw\nmaterial, and (v) cost. Note that sunlight is not always\nrequired for a solar cell. Any light with photon energies\ngreater than the bandgap will do. Solar cells are used\nto power electronic devices in satellites and space\nvehicles and also as power supply to some calculators. Production of\nlow-cost photovoltaic cells for large-scale solar energy is a topic\nfor research.\n\nFIGURE 14.24 (a) Typical p-n junction\nsolar cell; (b) Cross-sectional view.\n\nFIGURE 14.25 (a) A typical\nilluminated p-n junction solar cell;\n(b) I-V characteristics of a solar cell.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n490\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n4\n.7\n\nExample 14.7 Why are Si and GaAs are preferred materials for\nsolar cells?\n\nSolution  The solar radiation spectrum received by us is shown in\nFig. 14.26.\n\nFIGURE 14.26\n\nThe maxima is near 1.5 eV. For photo-excitation, hν > E\ng\n. Hence,\n\nsemiconductor with band gap ~1.5 eV or lower is likely to give better\nsolar conversion efficiency. Silicon has E\n\ng\n ~ 1.1 eV while for GaAs it is\n\n~1.53 eV. In fact, GaAs is better (in spite of its higher band gap) than\nSi because of its relatively higher absorption coefficient. If we choose\nmaterials like CdS or CdSe (E\n\ng\n ~ 2.4 eV), we can use only the high\n\nenergy component of the solar energy for photo-conversion and a\nsignificant part of energy will be of no use.\nThe question arises: why we do not use material like PbS (E\n\ng\n ~ 0.4 eV)\n\nwhich satisfy the condition hν > E\ng\n for ν maxima corresponding to the\n\nsolar radiation spectra? If we do so, most of the solar radiation will be\nabsorbed on the top-layer of solar cell and will not reach in or near\nthe depletion region. For effective electron-hole separation, due to\nthe junction field, we want the photo-generation to occur in the\njunction region only.\n\n14.9  DIGITAL ELECTRONICS AND LOGIC GATES\nIn electronics circuits like amplifiers, oscillators, introduced to you in\nearlier sections, the signal (current or voltage) has been in the form of\ncontinuous, time-varying voltage or current. Such signals are called\ncontinuous or analog signals. A typical analog signal is shown in Figure.\n14.27(a). Fig. 14.27(b) shows a pulse waveform in which only discrete\nvalues of voltages are possible. It is convenient to use binary numbers\nto represent such signals. A binary number has only two digits ‘0’ (say,\n0V) and ‘1’ (say, 5V). In digital electronics we use only these two levels of\nvoltage as shown in Fig. 14.27(b). Such signals are called Digital Signals.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n491\n\nSemiconductor Electronics:\n\nMaterials, Devices and\n\nSimple Circuits\n\nFIGURE 14.27 (a) Analog signal, (b) Digital signal.\n\nInput Output\n\nA Y\n\n0 1\n\n1 0\n\n(b)\nFIGURE 14.28\n\n(a) Logic symbol,\n(b) Truth table of\n\nNOT gate.\n\nIn digital circuits only two values (represented by 0 or 1) of the input and\noutput voltage are permissible.\n\nThis section is intended to provide the first step in our understanding\nof digital electronics. We shall restrict our study to some basic building\nblocks of digital electronics (called Logic Gates) which process the digital\nsignals in a specific manner. Logic gates are used in calculators, digital\nwatches, computers, robots, industrial control systems, and in\ntelecommunications.\n\nA light switch in your house can be used as an example of a digital\ncircuit. The light is either ON or OFF depending on the switch position.\nWhen the light is ON, the output value is ‘1’. When the light is OFF the\noutput value is ‘0’. The inputs are the position of the light switch. The\nswitch is placed either in the ON or OFF position to activate the light.\n\n14.9.1  Logic gates\n\nA gate is a digital circuit that follows curtain logical relationship\nbetween the input and output voltages. Therefore, they are generally\nknown as logic gates — gates because they control the flow of\ninformation. The five common logic gates used are NOT, AND, OR,\nNAND, NOR. Each logic gate is indicated by a symbol and its function\nis defined by a truth table that shows all the possible input logic level\ncombinations with their respective output logic levels. Truth tables\nhelp understand the behaviour of logic gates. These logic gates can be\nrealised using semiconductor devices.\n\n(i)  NOT gate\n\nThis is the most basic gate, with one input and one output. It produces\na ‘1’ output if the input is ‘0’ and vice-versa. That is, it produces an\ninverted version of the input at its output. This is why it is also known\nas an inverter. The commonly used symbol together with the truth\ntable for this gate is given in Fig. 14.28.\n\n(ii)  OR Gate\n\nAn OR gate has two or more inputs with one output. The logic symbol\nand truth table are shown in Fig. 14.29. The output Y is 1 when either\ninput A or input B or both are 1s, that is, if any of the input is high, the\noutput is high.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n492\n\nE\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n4\n.8\n\nApart from carrying out the above mathematical logic operation, this\ngate can be used for modifying the pulse waveform as explained in the\nfollowing example.\n\nExample 14.8 Justify the output waveform (Y) of the OR gate for the\nfollowing inputs A and B given in Fig. 14.30.\n\nSolution Note the following:\n• At t < t1; A = 0, B = 0; Hence Y = 0\n• For t1 to t2; A = 1, B = 0; Hence Y = 1\n• For t2 to t3; A = 1, B = 1; Hence Y = 1\n• For t3 to t4; A = 0, B = 1; Hence Y = 1\n• For t4 to t5; A = 0, B = 0; Hence Y = 0\n• For t5 to t6; A = 1, B = 0; Hence Y = 1\n• For t > t6; A = 0, B = 1; Hence Y = 1\nTherefore the waveform Y will be as shown in the Fig. 14.30.\n\nFIGURE 14.30\n\n(iii) AND Gate\nAn AND gate has two or more inputs and one output. The output Y of\nAND gate is 1 only when input A and input B are both 1.

If inputs A and B are both\n‘1’, the output Y is not ‘1’. The gate gets its name from this NOT  AND\nbehaviour. Figure 14.33 shows the symbol and truth table of NAND gate.\n\nNAND gates are also called Universal Gates since by using these\ngates you can realise other basic gates like OR, AND and NOT (Exercises\n14.12 and 14.13).\n\nFIGURE 14.33 (a) Logic symbol, (b) Truth table of NAND gate.\n\nExample 14.10 Sketch the output Y from a NAND gate having inputs\nA and B given below:\n\nSolution\n• For t < t1; A = 1, B = 1; Hence Y = 0\n• For t1 to t2; A = 0, B = 0; Hence Y = 1\n• For t2 to t3; A = 0, B = 1; Hence Y = 1\n• For t3 to t4; A = 1, B = 0; Hence Y = 1\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n494\n\nFASTER AND SMALLER: THE FUTURE OF COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY\n\nThe Integrated Chip (IC) is at the heart of all computer systems. In fact ICs are found in\nalmost all electrical devices like cars, televisions, CD players, cell phones etc. The\nminiaturisation that made the modern personal computer possible could never have\nhappened without the IC. ICs are electronic devices that contain many transistors, resistors,\ncapacitors, connecting wires – all in one package.

The symbol and truth table for NOR gate is given in\nFig. 14.35.\n\nFIGURE 14.35 (a) Logic symbol, (b) Truth table of NOR gate.\n\nNOR gates are considered as universal gates because you can obtain\nall the gates like AND, OR, NOT by using only NOR gates (Exercises 14.14\nand 14.15).\n\nInput Output\n\nA B Y\n\n0 0 1\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\n1 1 0\n\n(b)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n495\n\nSemiconductor Electronics:\n\nMaterials, Devices and\n\nSimple Circuits\n\nmicroprocessor. The microprocessor is an IC that processes all information in a computer,\nlike keeping track of what keys are pressed, running programmes, games etc. The IC was\nfirst invented by Jack Kilky at Texas Instruments in 1958 and he was awarded Nobel Prize\nfor this in 2000. ICs are produced on a piece of semiconductor crystal (or chip) by a process\ncalled photolithography. Thus, the entire Information Technology (IT) industry hinges on\nsemiconductors. Over the years, the complexity of ICs has increased while the size of its\nfeatures continued to shrink. In the past five decades, a dramatic miniaturisation in\ncomputer technology has made modern day computers faster and smaller. In the 1970s,\nGordon Moore, co-founder of INTEL, pointed out that the memory capacity of a chip (IC)\napproximately doubled every one and a half years. This is popularly known as Moore’s\nlaw. The number of transistors per chip has risen exponentially and each year computers\nare becoming more powerful, yet cheaper than the year before. It is intimated from current\ntrends that the computers available in 2020 will operate at 40 GHz (40,000 MHz) and\nwould be much smaller, more efficient and less expensive than present day computers.\nThe explosive growth in the semiconductor industry and computer technology is best\nexpressed by a famous quote from Gordon Moore: “If the auto industry advanced as rapidly\nas the semiconductor industry, a Rolls Royce would get half a million miles per gallon, and\nit would be cheaper to throw it away than to park it”.\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. Semiconductors are the basic materials used in the present solid state\nelectronic devices like diode, transistor, ICs, etc.\n\n2. Lattice structure and the atomic structure of constituent elements\ndecide whether a particular material will be insulator, metal or\nsemiconductor.\n\n3. Metals have low resistivity (10–2 to 10–8 Ωm), insulators have very high\nresistivity (>108 Ω m–1), while semiconductors have intermediate values\nof resistivity.\n\n4. Semiconductors are elemental (Si, Ge) as well as compound (GaAs,\nCdS, etc.).\n\n5. Pure semiconductors are called ‘intrinsic semiconductors’. The presence\nof charge carriers (electrons and holes) is an ‘intrinsic’ property of the\nmaterial and these are obtained as a result of thermal excitation. The\nnumber of electrons (n\n\ne\n) is equal to the number of holes (n\n\nh \n) in intrinsic\n\nconductors. Holes are essentially electron vacancies with an effective\npositive charge.\n\n6. The number of charge carriers can be changed by  ‘doping’ of a suitable\nimpurity in pure semiconductors. Such semiconductors are known as\nextrinsic semiconductors. These are of two types (n-type and p-type).\n\n7. In n-type semiconductors, n\ne\n >> n\n\nh\n while in p-type semiconductors n\n\nh >> ne.\n8. n-type semiconducting Si or Ge is obtained by doping with pentavalent\n\natoms (donors) like As, Sb, P, etc., while p-type Si or Ge can be obtained\nby doping with trivalent atom (acceptors) like B, Al, In etc.\n\n9. n\ne\nn\n\nh\n = n\n\ni\n\n2 in all cases. Further, the material possesses an overall charge\nneutrality.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n496\n\n10. There are two distinct band of energies (called valence band and\nconduction band) in which the electrons in a material lie. Valence\nband energies are low as compared to conduction band energies. All\nenergy levels in the valence band are filled while energy levels in the\nconduction band may be fully empty or partially filled. The electrons in\nthe conduction band are free to move in a solid and are responsible for\nthe conductivity. The extent of conductivity depends upon the energy\ngap (E\n\ng\n) between the top of valence band (E\n\nV\n) and the bottom of the\n\nconduction band E\nC\n. The electrons from valence band can be excited by\n\nheat, light or electrical energy to the conduction band and thus, produce\na change in the current flowing in a semiconductor.\n\n11. For insulators Eg > 3 eV, for semiconductors Eg is 0.2 eV to 3 eV, while\nfor metals E\n\ng\n ≈ 0.\n\n12. p-n junction is the ‘key’ to all semiconductor devices. When such a\njunction is made, a ‘depletion layer’ is formed consisting of immobile\nion-cores devoid of their electrons or holes. This is responsible for a\njunction potential barrier.\n\n13. By changing the external applied voltage, junction barriers can be\nchanged. In forward bias (n-side is connected to negative terminal of the\nbattery and p-side is connected to the positive), the barrier is decreased\nwhile the barrier increases in reverse bias. Hence, forward bias current\nis more (mA) while it is very small (µA) in a p-n junction diode.\n\n14. Diodes can be used for rectifying an ac voltage (restricting the ac voltage\nto one direction). With the help of a capacitor or a suitable filter, a dc\nvoltage can be obtained.\n\n15. There are some special purpose diodes.\n16. Zener diode is one such special purpose diode. In reverse bias, after a\n\ncertain voltage, the current suddenly increases (breakdown voltage) in\na Zener diode. This property has been used to obtain voltage regulation.\n\n17. p-n junctions have also been used to obtain many photonic or\noptoelectronic devices where one of the participating entity is ‘photon’:\n(a) Photodiodes in which photon excitation results in a change of reverse\nsaturation current which helps us to measure light intensity; (b) Solar\ncells which convert photon energy into electricity; (c) Light Emitting\nDiode and Diode Laser in which electron excitation by a bias voltage\nresults in the generation of light.\n\n18. There are some special circuits which handle the digital data consisting\nof 0 and 1 levels. This forms the subject of Digital Electronics.\n\n19. The important digital circuits performing special logic operations are\ncalled logic gates. These are: OR, AND, NOT, NAND, and NOR gates.\n\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n\n1. The energy bands (E\nC\n or E\n\nV\n) in the semiconductors are space delocalised\n\nwhich means that these are not located in any specific place inside the\nsolid. The energies are the overall averages. When you see a picture in\nwhich E\n\nC\n or E\n\nV\n are drawn as straight lines, then they should be\n\nrespectively taken simply as the bottom of conduction band energy levels\nand top of valence band energy levels.\n\n2. In elemental semiconductors (Si or Ge), the n-type or p-type\nsemiconductors are obtained by introducing ‘dopants’ as defects.
