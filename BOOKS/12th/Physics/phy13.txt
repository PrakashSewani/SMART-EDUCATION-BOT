The overall dimensions of a nucleus are much smaller\n\nthan those of an atom. Experiments on scattering of α-particles\ndemonstrated that the radius of a nucleus was smaller than the radius\n\nof an atom by a factor of about 104. This means the volume of a nucleus\n\nis about 10\n–12\n\n times the volume of the atom. In other words, an atom is\n\nalmost empty. If an atom is enlarged to the size of a classroom, the nucleus\n\nwould be of the size of pinhead. Nevertheless, the nucleus contains most\n\n(more than 99.9%) of the mass of an atom.\n\nDoes the nucleus have a structure, just as the atom does?  If so, what\n\nare the constituents of the nucleus?  How are these held together? In this\n\nchapter, we shall look for answers to such questions. We shall discuss\n\nvarious properties of nuclei such as their size, mass and stability, and\n\nalso associated nuclear phenomena such as radioactivity, fission and fusion.\n\n13.2  ATOMIC MASSES AND COMPOSITION OF NUCLEUS\nThe mass of an atom is very small, compared to a kilogram;  for example,\n\nthe mass of a carbon atom, \n12\n\nC, is 1.992647 × 10\n–26 \n\nkg. Kilogram is not\na very convenient unit to measure such small quantities. Therefore, a\n\nChapter Thirteen\n\nNUCLEI\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n439\n\nNuclei\n\ndifferent mass unit is used for expressing atomic masses. This unit is the\natomic mass unit (u), defined as 1/12\n\nth\n of the mass of the carbon (\n\n12\nC)\n\natom. According to this definition\n\n12\n mass of one C atom\n\n1u = \n12\n\n     \n261.992647 10 kg\n\n12\n\n−\n×\n\n=\n\n     271.660539 10 kg\n−\n\n= × (13.1)\n\nThe atomic masses of various elements expressed in atomic mass\n\nunit (u) are close to being integral multiples of the mass of a hydrogen\natom. There are, however, many striking exceptions to this rule. For\nexample, the atomic mass of chlorine atom is 35.46 u.\n\nAccurate measurement of atomic masses is carried out with a mass\nspectrometer, The measurement of atomic masses reveals the existence\nof different types of atoms of the same element, which exhibit the same\n\nchemical properties, but differ in mass. Such atomic species of the same\nelement differing in mass are called isotopes. (In Greek, isotope means\nthe same place, i.e. they occur in the same place in the periodic table of\n\nelements.) It was found that practically every element consists of a mixture\nof several isotopes.  The relative abundance of different isotopes differs\nfrom element to element. Chlorine, for example, has two isotopes having\n\nmasses 34.98 u and 36.98 u, which are nearly integral multiples of the\nmass of a hydrogen atom.  The relative abundances of these isotopes are\n75.4 and 24.6 per cent, respectively.  Thus, the average mass of a chlorine\n\natom is obtained by the weighted average of the masses of the two\nisotopes,  which works out to be\n\n= \n75.4 34.98 24.6 36.98\n\n100\n\n× + ×\n\n=  35.47 u\nwhich agrees with the atomic mass of chlorine.\n\nEven the lightest element, hydrogen has three isotopes having masses\n\n1.0078 u, 2.0141 u, and 3.0160 u.  The nucleus of the lightest atom of\nhydrogen, which has a relative abundance of 99.985%, is called the\nproton.  The mass of a proton is\n\n27\n1.00727 u 1.67262 10 kgpm\n\n−\n= = × (13.2)\n\nThis is equal to the mass of the hydrogen atom (= 1.00783u), minus\n\nthe mass of a single electron (m\ne \n= 0.00055 u).  The other two isotopes of\n\nhydrogen are called deuterium and tritium. Tritium nuclei, being\nunstable, do not occur naturally and are produced artificially in\n\nlaboratories.\nThe positive charge in the nucleus is that of the protons. A proton\n\ncarries one unit of fundamental charge and is stable. It was earlier thought\n\nthat the nucleus may contain electrons, but this was ruled out later using\narguments based on quantum theory. All the electrons of an atom are\noutside the nucleus. We know that the number of these electrons outside\n\nthe nucleus of the atom is Z, the atomic number. The total charge of the\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n440\n\natomic electrons is thus (–Ze), and since the atom is neutral, the charge\nof the nucleus is (+Ze). The number of protons in the nucleus of the atom\nis, therefore, exactly Z, the atomic number.\n\nDiscovery of Neutron\n\nSince the nuclei of deuterium and tritium are isotopes of hydrogen, they\nmust contain only one proton each.  But the masses of the nuclei of\n\nhydrogen, deuterium and tritium are in the ratio of 1:2:3.  Therefore, the\nnuclei of deuterium and tritium must contain,  in addition to a proton,\nsome neutral matter.  The amount of neutral matter present in the nuclei\n\nof these isotopes, expressed in units of mass of a proton, is approximately\nequal to one and two, respectively.  This fact indicates that the nuclei of\natoms contain, in addition to protons, neutral matter in multiples of a\n\nbasic unit.  This hypothesis was verified in 1932 by James Chadwick\nwho observed emission of neutral radiation when beryllium nuclei were\n\nbombarded with alpha-particles (α-particles are helium nuclei, to be\ndiscussed in a later section). It was found that this neutral radiation\ncould knock out protons from light nuclei such as those of helium, carbon\n\nand nitrogen. The only neutral radiation known at that time was photons\n(electromagnetic radiation). Application of the principles of conservation\nof energy and momentum showed that if the neutral radiation consisted\n\nof photons, the energy of photons would have to be much higher than is\n\navailable from the bombardment of beryllium nuclei with α-particles.\nThe clue to this puzzle, which Chadwick satisfactorily solved, was to\nassume that the neutral radiation consists of a new type of neutral\nparticles called neutrons.  From conservation of energy and momentum,\n\nhe was able to determine the mass of new particle ‘as very nearly the\nsame as mass of proton’.\n\nThe mass of a neutron is now known to a high degree of accuracy. It is\n\nm\nn\n = 1.00866 u = 1.6749×10–27 kg (13.3)\n\nChadwick was awarded the 1935 Nobel Prize in Physics for his\ndiscovery of the neutron.\n\nA free neutron, unlike a free proton, is unstable.  It decays into a\nproton, an electron and a antineutrino (another elementary particle), and\nhas a mean life of about 1000s.  It is, however, stable inside the nucleus.\n\nThe composition of a nucleus can now be described using the following\nterms and symbols:\n\nZ - atomic number = number of protons [13.4(a)]\n\nN - neutron number = number of neutrons [13.4(b)]\n\nA - mass number = Z + N\n\n                              = total number of protons and neutrons [13.4(c)]\n\nOne also uses the term nucleon for a proton or a neutron. Thus the\nnumber of nucleons in an atom is its mass number A.\n\nNuclear species or nuclides are shown by the notation X\nA\nZ\n\n where X is\n\nthe chemical symbol of the species.  For example, the nucleus of gold is\n\ndenoted by 197\n79 Au .  It contains 197 nucleons, of which 79 are protons\n\nand the rest118 are neutrons.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n441\n\nNuclei\n\nThe composition of isotopes of an element can now be readily\nexplained.  The nuclei of isotopes of a given element contain the same\nnumber of protons, but differ from each other in their number of neutrons.\n\nDeuterium, 2\n1 H , which is an isotope of hydrogen, contains one proton\n\nand one neutron.  Its other isotope tritium, 3\n1 H , contains one proton and\n\ntwo neutrons.  The element gold has 32 isotopes, ranging from A =173 to\n\nA = 204.  We have already mentioned that chemical properties of elements\ndepend on their electronic structure.  As the atoms of isotopes have\nidentical electronic structure they have identical chemical behaviour and\n\nare placed in the same location in the periodic table.\nAll nuclides with same mass number A are called isobars.  For\n\nexample, the nuclides 3\n1 H  and \n\n3\n2 He  are isobars.  Nuclides with same\n\nneutron number N but different atomic number Z, for example 198\n80 Hg\n\nand 197\n79 Au , are called isotones.\n\n13.3  SIZE OF THE NUCLEUS\nAs we have seen in Chapter 12, Rutherford was the pioneer who\n\npostulated and established the existence of the atomic nucleus. At\n\nRutherford’s suggestion, Geiger and Marsden performed their classic\n\nexperiment: on the scattering of α-particles from thin gold foils. Their\nexperiments revealed that the distance of closest approach to a gold\n\nnucleus of an α-particle of kinetic energy 5.5 MeV is about 4.0 × 10–14 m.\nThe scattering of α-particle by the gold sheet could be understood by\nRutherford by assuming that the coulomb repulsive force was solely\n\nresponsible for scattering. Since the positive charge is confined to the\n\nnucleus, the actual size of the nucleus has to be less than 4.0 × 10\n–14 \n\nm.\n\nIf we use α-particles of higher energies than 5.5 MeV, the distance of\n\nclosest approach to the gold nucleus will be smaller and at some point\n\nthe scattering will begin to be affected by the short range nuclear forces,\n\nand differ from Rutherford’s calculations. Rutherford’s calculations are\n\nbased on pure coulomb repulsion between the positive charges of the α-\n\nparticle and the gold nucleus. From the distance at which deviations set\n\nin, nuclear sizes can be inferred.\n\nBy performing scattering experiments in which fast electrons, instead\nof α-particles, are projectiles that bombard targets made up of various\nelements, the sizes of nuclei of various elements have been accurately\n\nmeasured.\nIt has been found that a nucleus of mass number A has a radius\n\nR = R\n0 \n\nA\n1/3\n\n(13.5)\n\nwhere R\n0\n = 1.2 × 10–15 m (=1.2 fm; 1 fm = 10–15 m). This means the volume\n\nof the nucleus, which is proportional to R\n3\n is proportional to A. Thus the\n\ndensity of nucleus is a constant, independent of A,  for all nuclei. Different\n\nnuclei are like a drop of liquid of constant density. The density of nuclear\n\nmatter is approximately 2.3 × 10\n17\n\n kg m\n–3\n\n. This density is very large\n\ncompared to ordinary matter, say water, which is 103 kg m–3. This is\n\nunderstandable, as we have already seen that most of the atom is empty.\n\nOrdinary matter consisting of atoms has a large amount of empty space.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n442\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n3\n.2\n\nExample 13.1 Given the mass of iron nucleus as 55.85u and A=56,\nfind the nuclear density?\n\nSolution\n\nm\nFe\n\n = 55.85,    u = 9.27 × 10\n–26\n\n  kg\n\nNuclear density = \nmass\n\nvolume\n = \n\n26\n\n15 3\n\n9.27 10 1\n\n56(4 /3)(1.2 10 )\n\n−\n\n−\n\n×\n×\n\nπ ×\n\n = 2.29 × 10\n17 \n\nkg m\n–3\n\nThe density of matter in neutron stars (an astrophysical object) is\ncomparable to this density. This shows that matter in these objects\n\nhas been compressed to such an extent that they resemble a big nucleus.\n\n13.4  MASS-ENERGY AND NUCLEAR BINDING ENERGY\n\n13.4.1  Mass – Energy\n\nEinstein showed from his theory of special relativity that it is necessary\n\nto treat mass as another form of energy. Before the advent of this theory\nof special relativity it was presumed  that mass and energy were conserved\nseparately in a reaction. However, Einstein showed that mass is another\n\nform of energy and one can convert mass-energy into other forms of\nenergy, say kinetic energy and vice-versa.\n\nEinstein gave the famous mass-energy equivalence relation\n\nE = mc\n2\n\n(13.6)\n\nHere the energy equivalent of mass m is related by the above equation\n\nand c is the velocity of light in vacuum and is approximately equal to\n3×10\n\n8\n m s\n\n–1\n.\n\nExample 13.2 Calculate the energy equivalent of 1 g of substance.\n\nSolution\n\nEnergy, E = 10\n–3 \n\n × ( 3 × 10\n8\n)\n2 \n\nJ\n\n     E = 10\n–3 \n\n× 9 × 10\n16 \n\n= 9 × 10\n13 \n\nJ\n\nThus, if one gram of matter is converted to energy, there is a release\n\nof enormous amount of energy.\n\nExperimental verification of the Einstein’s mass-energy relation has\n\nbeen achieved in the study of nuclear reactions amongst nucleons, nuclei,\n\nelectrons and other more recently discovered particles. In a reaction the\n\nconservation law of energy states that the initial energy and the final\n\nenergy are equal provided the energy associated with mass is also\n\nincluded. This concept is important in understanding nuclear masses\n\nand the interaction of nuclei with one another. They form the subject\n\nmatter of the next few sections.\n\n13.4.2  Nuclear binding energy\n\nIn Section 13.2 we have seen that the nucleus is made up of neutrons\nand protons.  Therefore it may be expected that the mass of the nucleus\n\nis equal to the total mass of its individual protons and neutrons.  However,\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n3\n.1\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n443\n\nNuclei\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n3\n.3\n\nthe nuclear mass M is found to be always less than this.  For example, let\n\nus consider 16\n8 O ; a nucleus which has 8 neutrons and 8 protons.  We\n\nhave\n\nMass of 8 neutrons = 8 × 1.00866 u\n\nMass of 8 protons   = 8 × 1.00727 u\n\nMass of 8 electrons = 8 × 0.00055 u\n\nTherefore the expected mass of 16\n8 O  nucleus\n\n= 8 × 2.01593 u = 16.12744 u.\n\nThe atomic mass of 16\n8 O  found from mass spectroscopy experiments\n\nis seen to be 15.99493 u. Substracting the mass of 8 electrons (8 × 0.00055 u)\n\nfrom this, we get the experimental mass of 16\n8 O  nucleus to be 15.99053 u.\n\nThus, we find that the mass of the 16\n8 O  nucleus is less than the total\n\nmass of its constituents by 0.13691u. The difference in mass of a nucleus\n\nand its constituents, ∆M, is called the mass defect, and is given by\n\n[ ( ) ]p nM Zm A Z m M∆ = + − − (13.7)\n\nWhat is the meaning of the mass defect? It is here that Einstein’s\nequivalence  of mass and energy plays a role. Since the mass of the oxygen\n\nnucleus is less that the sum of the masses of its constituents (8 protons\nand 8 neutrons, in the unbound state), the equivalent energy of the oxygen\nnucleus is less than that of the sum of the equivalent energies of its\n\nconstituents. If one wants to break the oxygen nucleus into 8 protons\n\nand 8 neutrons, this extra energy ∆M c2, has to supplied. This energy\nrequired E\n\nb\n is related to the mass defect by\n\nE\nb\n = ∆ M c2 (13.8)\n\nExample 13.3  Find the energy equivalent of one atomic mass unit,\nfirst in Joules and then in MeV.  Using this, express the mass defect\n\nof 16\n8 O  in MeV/c\n\n2\n.\n\nSolution\n1u = 1.6605 × 10\n\n–27\n kg\n\nTo convert it into energy units, we multiply it by c\n2 \n\nand find that\n\nenergy equivalent = 1.6605 × 10\n–27\n\n × (2.9979 × 10\n8\n)\n2\n kg m\n\n2\n/s\n\n2\n\n      = 1.4924 × 10\n–10\n\n J\n\n      =   \n\n10\n\n19\n\n1.4924 10\neV\n\n1.602 10\n\n−\n\n−\n\n×\n\n×\n\n      =   0.9315 × 10\n9\n eV\n\n      =   931.5 MeV\n\nor, 1u = 931.5 MeV/c\n2\n\nFor 16\n8 O ,   ∆M = 0.13691 u = 0.13691×931.5 MeV/c\n\n2\n\n= 127.5 MeV/c\n2\n\nThe energy needed to separate 16\n8 O  into its constituents is thus\n\n127.5 MeV/c\n2\n.\n\nIf a certain number of neutrons and protons are brought together to\n\nform a nucleus of a certain charge and mass, an energy E\nb\n will be released\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n444\n\nin the process.  The energy E\nb\n is called the binding energy of the nucleus.\n\nIf we separate a nucleus into its nucleons, we would have to supply a\ntotal energy equal to E\n\nb\n, to those particles.  Although we cannot tear\n\napart a nucleus in this way, the nuclear binding energy is still a convenient\nmeasure of how well a nucleus is held together.  A more useful measure\nof the binding between the constituents of the nucleus is the binding\n\nenergy per nucleon, E\nbn\n\n, which is the ratio of the binding energy E\nb\n of a\n\nnucleus to the number of the nucleons, A, in that nucleus:\n\nE\nbn  \n\n =  E\nb\n / A (13.9)\n\nWe can think of binding energy per nucleon as the average energy\nper nucleon needed to separate a nucleus into its individual nucleons.\n\nFigure 13.1 is a plot of the\n\nbinding energy per nucleon E\nbn\n\nversus the mass number A for a\nlarge number of nuclei. We notice\n\nthe following main features of\nthe plot:\n(i) the binding energy per\n\nnucleon, E\nbn\n\n, is practically\nconstant, i.e. practically\nindependent of the atomic\nnumber for nuclei of middle\n\nmass number ( 30 < A < 170).\nThe curve has a maximum of\nabout 8.75 MeV for A = 56\n\nand has a value of 7.6 MeV\nfor A = 238.\n\n(ii) E\nbn\n\n is lower for both light\n\nnuclei (A<30) and heavy\nnuclei (A>170).\n\nWe can draw some conclusions from these two observations:\n\n(i) The force is attractive and sufficiently strong to produce a binding\nenergy of a few MeV per nucleon.\n\n(ii) The constancy of the binding energy in the range 30 < A < 170 is a\n\nconsequence of the fact that the nuclear force is short-ranged. Consider\na particular nucleon inside a sufficiently large nucleus. It will be under\nthe influence of only some of its neighbours, which come within the\n\nrange of the nuclear force. If any other nucleon is at a distance more\nthan the range of the nuclear force from the particular nucleon it will\nhave no influence on the binding energy of the nucleon under\n\nconsideration. If a nucleon can have a maximum of p neighbours\nwithin the range of nuclear force, its binding energy would be\nproportional to p. Let the binding energy of the nucleus be pk, where\n\nk is a constant having the dimensions of energy. If we increase A by\nadding nucleons they will not change the binding energy of a nucleon\ninside. Since most of the nucleons in a large nucleus reside inside it\n\nand not on the surface, the change in binding energy per nucleon\nwould be small. The binding energy per nucleon is a constant and is\napproximately equal to pk. The property that a given nucleon\n\nFIGURE 13.1 The binding energy per nucleon\nas a function of mass number.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n445\n\nNuclei\n\ninfluences only nucleons close to it is also referred to as saturation\nproperty of the nuclear force.\n\n(iii) A very heavy nucleus, say A = 240, has lower binding energy per\n\nnucleon compared to that of a  nucleus with A = 120. Thus if a\nnucleus A = 240 breaks into two A = 120 nuclei, nucleons get more\ntightly bound. This implies energy would be released in the process.\n\nIt has very important implications for energy production through\nfission, to be discussed later in Section 13.7.1.\n\n(iv) Consider two very light nuclei (A ≤ 10) joining to form a heavier\n\nnucleus. The binding energy  per nucleon of the fused heavier nuclei\nis more than the binding energy per nucleon of the lighter nuclei.\nThis means that the final system is more tightly bound than the initial\n\nsystem. Again energy would be released in such a process of\nfusion. This is the energy source of sun, to be discussed later in\nSection 13.7.3.\n\n13.5  NUCLEAR FORCE\nThe force that determines the motion of atomic electrons is the familiar\n\nCoulomb force. In Section 13.4,  we have seen that for average mass\n\nnuclei the binding energy per nucleon is  approximately 8 MeV, which is\n\nmuch larger than the binding energy in atoms. Therefore, to bind a\n\nnucleus together there must be a strong attractive force of a totally\n\ndifferent kind. It must be strong enough to overcome the repulsion\n\nbetween the (positively charged) protons and to bind both protons and\n\nneutrons into the tiny nuclear volume. We have already seen\n\nthat the constancy of binding energy per nucleon can be\n\nunderstood in terms of its short-range. Many features of the\n\nnuclear binding force are summarised below. These are\n\nobtained from a variety of experiments carried out during 1930\n\nto 1950.\n\n(i) The nuclear force is much stronger than the Coulomb force\n\nacting between charges or the gravitational forces between\n\nmasses. The nuclear binding force has to dominate over\n\nthe Coulomb repulsive force between protons inside the\n\nnucleus. This happens only because the nuclear force is\n\nmuch stronger than the coulomb force. The gravitational\n\nforce is much weaker  than even Coulomb force.\n\n(ii) The nuclear force between two nucleons falls rapidly to\n\nzero as their distance is more than a few femtometres. This\n\nleads to saturation of forces in a medium or a large-sized\n\nnucleus, which is the reason for the constancy of the\n\nbinding energy per nucleon.\n\nA rough plot of the potential energy between two nucleons\n\nas a function of distance is shown in the Fig. 13.2. The\n\npotential energy is a minimum at a distance r\n0\n of about\n\n0.8 fm. This means that the force is attractive for distances larger\n\nthan 0.8 fm and repulsive if they are separated by distances less\n\nthan 0.8 fm.\n\nFIGURE 13.2 Potential energy\nof a pair of nucleons as a\n\nfunction of their separation.\n\nFor a separation greater\nthan r\n\n0\n, the force is attractive\n\nand for separations less\n\nthan r\n0\n, the force is\n\nstrongly repulsive.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n446\n\n(iii) The nuclear force between neutron-neutron, proton-neutron and\nproton-proton is approximately the same. The nuclear force does not\ndepend on the electric charge.\n\nUnlike Coulomb’s law or the Newton’s law of gravitation there is no\nsimple mathematical form of the nuclear force.\n\n13.6  RADIOACTIVITY\nA. H. Becquerel discovered radioactivity in 1896 purely by accident.  While\n\nstudying the fluorescence and phosphorescence of compounds irradiated\nwith visible light, Becquerel observed an interesting phenomenon.  After\nilluminating some pieces of uranium-potassium sulphate with visible\n\nlight, he wrapped them in black paper and separated the package from a\nphotographic plate by a piece of silver.  When, after several hours of\nexposure, the photographic plate was developed, it showed blackening\n\ndue to something that must have been emitted by the compound and\nwas able to penetrate both black paper and the silver.\n\nExperiments performed subsequently showed that radioactivity was\n\na nuclear phenomenon in which an unstable nucleus undergoes a decay.\nThis is referred to as radioactive decay. Three types of radioactive decay\noccur in nature :\n\n(i) α-decay in which a helium nucleus 4\n2\nHe  is emitted;\n\n(ii) β-decay in which electrons or positrons (particles with the same mass\nas electrons, but with a charge exactly opposite to that of electron)\nare emitted;\n\n(iii) γ-decay in which high energy (hundreds of keV or more) photons are\nemitted.\n\nEach of these decay will be considered in subsequent sub-sections.\n\n13.6.1  Law of radioactive decay\n\nIn any radioactive sample, which undergoes α, β or γ-decay, it is found\nthat the number of nuclei undergoing the decay per unit time is\nproportional to the total number of nuclei in the sample. If N is the\n\nnumber of nuclei in the sample and ∆N undergo decay in time ∆t then\n\nN\nN\n\nt\n\n∆\n∝\n\n∆\n\nor,  ∆N/∆t = λN, (13.10)\n\nwhere λ is called the radioactive decay constant or disintegration constant.\n\nThe change in the number of nuclei in the sample* is dN = – ∆N in\n\ntime ∆t. Thus the rate of change of N is (in the limit ∆t → 0)\n\nd\n–\n\nd\n\nN\nN\n\nt\nλ=\n\n* ∆N is the number of nuclei that decay, and hence is always positive. dN is the\nchange in N, which may have either sign. Here it is negative, because out of\noriginal N nuclei, ∆N have decayed, leaving (N–∆N ) nuclei.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n447\n\nNuclei\n\nor,  \ndN\n\nN\n = –λdt\n\nNow, integrating both sides of the above equation,we get,\n\n(13.11)\n\nor, ln N  − ln N\n0\n = −λ (t – t\n\n0\n) (13.12)\n\nHere N\n0\n is the number of radioactive nuclei in the sample at some\n\narbitrary time t\n0\n and N is the number of radioactive nuclei at any\n\nsubsequent time t.  Setting t\n0\n = 0 and rearranging Eq. (13.12) gives us\n\nln\n0\n\nN\nt\n\nN\n= −λ (13.13)\n\nwhich gives\n\nN(t) = N\n0\n e \n\n−λ t\n(13.14)\n\nNote, for example, the light bulbs follow no such exponential decay law.\nIf we test 1000 bulbs for their life (time span before they burn out or\nfuse), we expect that they will ‘decay’ (that is, burn out) at more or less\nthe same time. The decay of radionuclides follows quite a different law,\nthe law of radioactive decay represented by Eq. (13.14).\n\nThe total decay rate R of a sample is the number of nuclei\ndisintegrating per unit time. Suppose in a time interval dt, the decay\ncount measured  is ∆N. Then dN = – ∆N.\n\nThe positive quantity R is then defined as\n\nR = –\nd\n\nd\n\nN\n\nt\n\nDifferentiating Eq. (13.14), we get\n\nR  = λN\n0\n e \n\n−λt\n\nor,  R  = R\n0\n e –λt (13.15)\n\nThis is equivalant to the law of radioactivity decay,\nsince you can integrate Eq. (13.15) to get back Eq.\n\n(13.14). Clearly, R\n0\n  = λN\n\n0\n is the  decay rate at t = 0. The\n\ndecay rate R at a certain time t and the number of\n\nundecayed nuclei N at the same time are related by\n\nR  = λN (13.16)\n\nThe decay rate of a sample, rather than the number of radioactive\n\nnuclei, is a more direct experimentally measurable quantity and is given\n\na specific name: activity. The SI unit for activity is becquerel, named\n\nafter the discoverer of radioactivity, Henry Becquerel.\n\nFIGURE 13.3 Exponential decay of a\n\nradioactive species.

A common way to characterize this feature is\nthrough the notion of half-life. Half-life of a radionuclide\n(denoted by T\n\n1/2\n) is the time it takes for a sample that has\n\ninitially, say N\n0\n radionuclei to reduce to N\n\n0\n/2. Putting\n\nN = N\n0\n/2 and t = T\n\n1/2 \nin Eq. (13.14), we get\n\nT\n1/2\n\n = \nln2\n\nλ\n    = \n\n0.693\n\nλ\n(13.17)\n\nClearly if N\n0\n reduces to half its value in time T\n\n1/2\n, R\n\n0\n\nwill also reduce to half its value in the same time according\nto Eq. (13.16).\n\nAnother related measure is the average or mean life\nτ. This again can be obtained from Eq. (13.14). The\nnumber of nuclei which decay in the time interval t to t +\n∆t is R(t )∆t  (= λN\n\n0\ne\n\n–λt\n∆t ).  Each of them has lived for time\n\nt. Thus the total life of all these nuclei would be t λN\n0\ne\n\n–λt\n\n∆t. It is clear that some nuclei may live for a short time\nwhile others may live longer. Therefore to obtain the mean\nlife, we have to sum (or integrate) this expression over all\ntimes from 0 to ∞ , and divide by the total number N0 of\nnuclei at t = 0.

In the next 12.5 y, one-half of these nuclei\nwould have decayed.  Hence, one fourth of the sample of the initial\n\npure tritium will remain undecayed.\n\n13.6.2  Alpha decay\n\nA well-known example of alpha decay is the decay of uranium 238\n92 U to\n\nthorium 234\n90 Th  with the emission of a helium nucleus \n\n4\n2 He\n\n238\n92U → \n\n234\n90 Th  + \n\n4\n2 He                (α-decay) (13.19)\n\nIn α-decay, the mass number of the product nucleus (daughter\nnucleus) is four less than that of the decaying nucleus (parent nucleus),\n\nwhile the atomic number decreases by two. In general, α-decay of a parent\n\nnucleus  A\nZ X  results in a daughter nucleus \n\nA 4\nZ 2Y\n\n−\n−\n\nA\nZ X  → \n\nA 4\nZ 2Y\n\n−\n−\n\n + 4\n2 He (13.20)\n\nFrom Einstein’s mass-energy equivalance relation [Eq. (13.6)] and\nenergy conservation, it is clear that this spontaneous decay is possible\nonly when the total mass of the decay products is less than the mass of\n\nthe initial nucleus. This difference in mass appears as kinetic energy of\nthe products. By referring to a table of nuclear masses, one can check\n\nthat the total mass of 234\n90 Th  and \n\n4\n2 He  is indeed less than that of \n\n238\n92U.\n\nThe disintegration energy or the Q-value of a nuclear reaction is the\n\ndifference between the initial mass energy and the total mass energy of\n\nthe decay products. For α-decay\n\nQ = (m\nX\n – m\n\nY\n – m\n\nHe\n) c2 (13.21)\n\nQ is also the net kinetic energy gained in the process or, if the initial\nnucleus X is at rest, the kinetic energy of the products. Clearly, Q> 0 for\n\nexothermic processes such as α-decay.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n450\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n3\n.6\n\nExample 13.6 We are given the following atomic masses:\n238\n92U  = 238.05079 u\n\n4\n2 He = 4.00260 u\n\n234\n90 Th  = 234.04363 u\n\n1\n1H= 1.00783 u\n\n237\n91Pa = 237.05121 u\n\nHere the symbol Pa is for the element protactinium (Z = 91).\n\n(a) Calculate the energy released during the alpha decay of 238\n92U.\n\n(b) Show that 238\n92U  can not spontaneously emit a proton.\n\nSolution\n\n(a) The alpha decay of 238\n92 U  is given by Eq. (13.20). The energy released\n\nin this process is given by\n\nQ = (m\nU\n – m\n\nTh\n – m\n\nHe\n) c\n\n2\n\nSubstituting the atomic masses as given in the data, we find\nQ = (238.05079 – 234.04363 – 4.00260)u × c\n\n2\n\n   = (0.00456 u) c\n2\n\n   = (0.00456 u) (931.5 MeV/u)\n   = 4.25 MeV.\n\n(b) If  238\n92U  spontaneously emits a proton, the decay process would be\n\n238\n92U  → \n\n237\n91Pa  + \n\n1\n1H\n\nThe Q for this process to happen is\n= (m\n\nU\n – m\n\nPa\n – m\n\nH\n) c\n\n2\n\n= (238.05079 – 237.05121 – 1.00783) u × c\n2\n\n= (– 0.00825 u) c\n2\n\n= – (0.00825 u)(931.5 MeV/u)\n= – 7.68 MeV\n\nThus, the Q of the process is negative and therefore it cannot proceed\nspontaneously.  We will have to supply an energy of 7.68 MeV to a\n238\n92U  nucleus to make it emit a proton.\n\n13.6.3  Beta decay\n\nIn beta decay, a nucleus spontaneously emits an electron (β\n−−−−− \ndecay) or a\n\npositron (β+ decay). A common example of β −−\n−−− decay is\n\n32 32\n15 16P S e ν\n\n−\n→ + + (13.22)\n\nand that of β+  decay is\n\n22 22\n11 10Na Ne e ν\n\n+\n→ + + (13.23)\n\nThe decays are governed by the Eqs. (13.14) and (13.15), so that one\ncan never predict which nucleus will undergo decay, but one can\n\ncharacterize the decay by a half-life T\n1/2\n\n . For example, T\n1/2\n\n for the decays\nabove is respectively 14.3 d and 2.6y. The emission of electron in β\n\n−−−−− \ndecay\n\nis accompanied by the emission of an antineutrino (ν ); in β\n+ \ndecay, instead,\n\na neutrino (ν) is generated. Neutrinos are neutral particles with very small\n(possiblly, even zero) mass compared to electrons. They have only weak\ninteraction with other particles. They are, therefore, very difficult to detect,\n\nsince they can penetrate large quantity of matter (even earth) without any\ninteraction.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n451\n\nNuclei\n\nIn both β\n−−−−−\n and β\n\n+ \ndecay, the mass number A remains unchanged. In\n\nβ\n−−−−− \ndecay, the atomic number Z of the nucleus goes up by 1, while in β\n\n+\n\ndecay Z goes down by 1. The basic nuclear process underlying β\n−−−−−\n decay\n\nis the conversion of neutron to proton\n\nn → p + e\n–\n + ν (13.24)\n\nwhile for β\n+ \ndecay, it is the conversion of proton into neutron\n\np → n + e\n+\n + ν (13.25)\n\nNote that while a free neutron decays to proton, the decay of proton to\nneutron [Eq. (13.25)] is possible only inside the nucleus, since proton\nhas smaller mass than neutron.\n\n13.6.4  Gamma decay\n\nLike an atom, a nucleus also has discrete energy levels - the ground\n\nstate and excited states. The scale of energy is, however, very different.\nAtomic energy level spacings are of the order of eV, while the difference in\nnuclear energy levels is of the order of MeV. When a\n\nnucleus in an excited state spontaneously decays\nto its ground state (or to a lower energy state), a\nphoton is emitted with energy equal to the difference\n\nin the two energy levels of the nucleus. This is the\nso-called gamma decay. The energy (MeV)\ncorresponds to radiation of extremely short\n\nwavelength, shorter than the hard X-ray region.\nTypically, a gamma ray is emitted when a α or β\n\ndecay results in a daughter nucleus in an excited\n\nstate. This then returns to the ground state by a\nsingle photon transition or successive transitions\ninvolving more than one photon. A familiar example\n\nis the successive emmission of gamma rays of\nenergies 1.17 MeV and 1.33 MeV from the\n\ndeexcitation of  60\n28 Ni  nuclei formed from  β\n\n−−−−− \ndecay\n\nof 60\n27Co .\n\n13.7  NUCLEAR ENERGY\nThe curve of binding energy per nucleon E\n\nbn\n, given in Fig. 13.1, has\n\na long flat middle region between A = 30 and A = 170. In this region\n\nthe binding energy per nucleon is nearly constant (8.0 MeV). For\n\nthe lighter nuclei region, A < 30, and for the heavier nuclei region,\n\nA > 170, the binding energy per nucleon is less than 8.0 MeV, as we\n\nhave noted earlier. Now, the greater the binding energy, the less is the\n\ntotal mass of a bound system, such as a nucleus. Consequently, if nuclei\n\nwith less total binding energy transform to nuclei with greater binding\n\nenergy, there will be a net energy release. This is what happens when a\n\nheavy nucleus decays into two or more intermediate mass fragments\n\n(fission) or when light nuclei fuse into a havier nucleus (fusion.)\n\nExothermic chemical reactions underlie conventional energy sources\n\nsuch as coal or petroleum. Here the energies involved are in the range of\n\nFIGURE 13.4 β-decay of \n28\n\n60\nNi  nucleus\n\nfollowed by emission of two γ rays\nfrom deexcitation of the daughter\n\nnucleus \n28\n\n60\nNi .\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n452\n\nelectron volts. On the other hand,  in a nuclear reaction, the energy release\n\nis of the order of MeV. Thus for the same quantity of matter, nuclear\n\nsources produce a million times more energy than a chemical source.\n\nFission of 1 kg of uranium, for example, generates 10\n14\n\n J of energy;\n\ncompare it with burning of 1 kg of coal that gives 10\n7\n J.\n\n13.7.1  Fission\n\nNew possibilities emerge when we go beyond natural radioactive decays\n\nand study nuclear reactions by bombarding nuclei with other nuclear\nparticles such as proton, neutron, α-particle, etc.\n\nA most important neutron-induced nuclear reaction is fission. An\n\nexample of fission is when a uranium isotope 235\n92 U  bombarded with a\n\nneutron breaks into two intermediate mass nuclear fragments\n\n1 235 236 144 89 1\n0 92 92 56 36 0n U U Ba Kr 3 n+ → → + + (13.26)\n\nThe same reaction can produce other pairs of intermediate mass\nfragments\n\n1 235 236 133 99 1\n0 92 92 51 41 0n U U Sb Nb 4 n+ → → + + (13.27)\n\nOr, as another example,\n\n1 235 140 94 1\n0 92 54 38 0n U Xe Sr 2 n+ → + + (13.28)\n\nThe fragment products are radioactive nuclei; they emit β particles in\nsuccession to achieve stable end products.\n\nThe energy released (the Q value ) in the fission reaction of nuclei like\nuranium is of the order of 200 MeV per fissioning nucleus. This is\nestimated as follows:\n\nLet us take a nucleus with A = 240 breaking into two fragments each\nof A = 120. Then\n\nE\nbn\n\n for A = 240 nucleus is about 7.6 MeV,\n\nE\nbn \n\nfor the two A = 120 fragment nuclei is about 8.5 MeV.\n\n∴ Gain in binding energy for nucleon is about 0.9 MeV.\n\nHence the total gain in binding energy is 240×0.9 or 216 MeV.\n\nThe disintegration energy in fission events first appears as the kinetic\n\nenergy of the fragments and neutrons. Eventually it is transferred to the\n\nsurrounding matter appearing as heat. The source of energy in nuclear\n\nreactors, which produce electricity, is nuclear fission. The enormous\n\nenergy released in an atom bomb comes from uncontrolled nuclear fission.\n\nWe discuss some details in the next section how a nuclear reactor\n\nfunctions.\n\n13.7.2  Nuclear reactor\n\nNotice one fact of great importance in the fission reactions given in Eqs.\n(13.26) to (13.28). There is a release of extra neutron (s) in the fission\nprocess. Averagely, 2½ neutrons are released per fission of uranium\n\nnucleus. It is a fraction since in some fission events 2 neutrons are\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n453\n\nNuclei\n\nproduced, in some 3, etc. The extra neutrons in turn can initiate fission\nprocesses, producing still more neutrons, and so on. This leads to the\n\npossibility of a chain reaction, as was first suggested by Enrico Fermi. If\nthe chain reaction is controlled suitably, we can get a steady energy\n\nINDIA’S ATOMIC ENERGY PROGRAMME\n\nThe atomic energy programme in India was launched around the time of independence\nunder the leadership of Homi J. Bhabha (1909-1966). An early historic achievement\n\nwas the design and construction of the first nuclear reactor in India (named Apsara)\nwhich went critical on August 4, 1956. It used enriched uranium as fuel and water as\nmoderator. Following this was another notable landmark: the construction of CIRUS\n\n(Canada India Research U.S.) reactor in 1960. This 40 MW reactor used natural uranium\nas fuel and heavy water as moderator. Apsara and CIRUS spurred research in a wide\nrange of areas of basic and applied nuclear science. An important milestone in the first\n\ntwo decades of the programme was the indigenous design and construction of the\nplutonium plant at Trombay, which ushered in the technology of fuel reprocessing\n(separating useful fissile and fertile nuclear materials from the spent fuel of a reactor) in\n\nIndia. Research reactors that have been subsequently commissioned include ZERLINA,\nPURNIMA (I, II and III), DHRUVA and KAMINI. KAMINI is the country’s first large research\nreactor that uses U-233 as fuel. As the name suggests, the primary objective of a research\n\nreactor is not generation of power but to provide a facility for research on different aspects\nof nuclear science and technology. Research reactors are also an excellent source for\nproduction of a variety of radioactive isotopes that find application in diverse fields:\n\nindustry, medicine and agriculture.\nThe main objectives of the Indian Atomic Energy programme are to provide safe and\n\nreliable electric power for the country’s social and economic progress and to be self-\n\nreliant in all aspects of nuclear technology. Exploration of atomic minerals in India\nundertaken since the early fifties has indicated that India has limited reserves of uranium,\nbut fairly abundant reserves of thorium. Accordingly, our country has adopted a three-\n\nstage strategy of nuclear power generation. The first stage involves the use of natural\nuranium as a fuel, with heavy water as moderator. The Plutonium-239 obtained from\nreprocessing of the discharged fuel from the reactors then serves as a fuel for the second\n\nstage — the fast breeder reactors. They are so called because they use fast neutrons for\nsustaining the chain reaction (hence no moderator is needed) and, besides generating\npower, also breed more fissile species (plutonium) than they consume. The third stage,\n\nmost significant in the long term, involves using fast breeder reactors to produce fissile\nUranium-233 from Thorium-232 and to build power reactors based on them.\n\nIndia is currently well into the second stage of the programme and considerable\n\nwork has also been done on the third — the thorium utilisation — stage. The country\nhas mastered the complex technologies of mineral exploration and mining, fuel\nfabrication, heavy water production, reactor design, construction and operation, fuel\n\nreprocessing, etc. Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) built at different sites in\nthe country mark the accomplishment of the first stage of the programme. India is now\nmore than self-sufficient in heavy water production. Elaborate safety measures both in\n\nthe design and operation of reactors, as also adhering to stringent standards of\nradiological protection are the hallmark of the Indian Atomic Energy Programme.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n454\n\noutput. This is what happens in a nuclear reactor. If the chain reaction is\nuncontrolled, it leads to explosive energy output, as in a nuclear bomb.\n\nThere is, however, a hurdle in sustaining a chain reaction, as described\n\nhere. It is known experimentally that slow neutrons (thermal neutrons)\n\nare much more likely to cause fission in 235\n92 U  than fast neutrons. Also\n\nfast neutrons liberated in fission would escape instead of causing another\n\nfission reaction.\n\nThe average energy of a neutron produced in fission of 235\n92 U  is 2 MeV.\n\nThese neutrons unless slowed down will escape from the reactor without\n\ninteracting with the uranium nuclei, unless a very large amount of\nfissionable material is used for sustaining the chain reaction. What one\nneeds to do is to slow down the fast neutrons by elastic scattering with\n\nlight nuclei. In fact, Chadwick’s experiments showed that in an elastic\ncollision with hydrogen the neutron almost comes to rest and proton\ncarries away the energy. This is the same situation as when a marble hits\n\nhead-on an identical marble at rest. Therefore, in reactors, light nuclei\ncalled moderators are provided along with the fissionable nuclei for slowing\ndown fast neutrons. The moderators commonly used are water, heavy\n\nwater (D\n2\nO) and graphite. The Apsara reactor at the Bhabha Atomic\n\nResearch Centre (BARC), Mumbai, uses water as moderator. The other\nIndian reactors, which are used for power production, use heavy water\n\nas moderator.\nBecause of the use of moderator, it is possible that the ratio, K, of\n\nnumber of fission produced by a given generation of neutrons to the\n\nnumber of fission of the preceeding generation may be greater than one.\nThis ratio is called the multiplication factor; it is the measure of the growth\nrate of the neutrons in the reactor.  For K = 1, the operation of the reactor\nis said to be critical, which is what we wish it to be for steady power\noperation. If K becomes greater than one, the reaction rate and the reactor\npower increases exponentially. Unless the factor K is brought down very\nclose to unity, the reactor will become supercritical and can even explode.\nThe explosion of the Chernobyl reactor in Ukraine in 1986 is a sad\nreminder that accidents in a nuclear reactor can be catastrophic.\n\nThe reaction rate is controlled through control-rods made out of\nneutron-absorbing material such as cadmium. In addition to control rods,\nreactors are provided with safety rods which, when required, can be\ninserted into the reactor and K can be reduced rapidly to less than unity.\n\nThe more abundant isotope 238\n92 U  in naturally occurring uranium is\n\nnon-fissionable. When it captures a neutron, it produces the highly\nradioactive plutonium through these reactions\n\n238 239 239 –\n92 92 93U+ n U Np+e ν→ → +\n\n239 239 –\n93 94Np Pu+e ν→ + (13.29)\n\nPlutonium undergoes fission with slow neutrons.\n\nFigure 13.5 shows the schematic diagram of a nuclear reactor based\non thermal neutron fission. The core of the reactor is the site of nuclear\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n455\n\nNuclei\n\nfission. It contains the fuel elements in suitably fabricated form. The fuel\nmay be say enriched uranium (i.e., one that has greater abundance of\n235\n92 U  than naturally occurring uranium). The core contains a moderator\n\nto slow down the neutrons. The core is surrounded by a reflector to reduce\nleakage. The energy (heat) released in fission is continuously removed by\na suitable coolant. A containment vessel prevents the escape of radioactive\nfission products. The whole assembly is shielded to check harmful\nradiation from coming out. The reactor can be shut down by means of\nrods (made of, for example, cadmium) that have high absorption of\nneutrons. The coolant transfers heat to a working fluid which in turn\nmay produce stream. The steam drives turbines and generates electricity.\n\nLike any power reactor, nuclear reactors generate considerable waste\nproducts. But nuclear wastes need special care for treatment since they\nare radioactive and hazardous. Elaborate safety measures, both for reactor\n\noperation as well as handling and reprocessing the spent fuel, are\n\nrequired. These safety measures are a distinguishing feature of the Indian\n\nAtomic Energy programme. An appropriate plan is being evolved to study\nthe possibility of converting radioactive waste into less active and short-\n\nlived material.\n\n13.7.3  Nuclear fusion – energy generation in stars\n\nWhen two light nuclei fuse to form a larger nucleus, energy is released,\nsince the larger nucleus is more tightly bound, as seen from the binding\nenergy curve in Fig.13.1. Some examples of such energy liberating nuclear\n\nfusion reactions are :\n\n1 1 2\n1 1 1H H H+ → + e\n\n+\n + ν + 0.42 MeV [13.29(a)]\n\n2 2 3\n1 1 2H H He+ → + n + 3.27 MeV [13.29(b)]\n\n2 2 3 1\n1 1 1 1H H H H+ → + + 4.03 MeV [13.29(c)]\n\nA\n s\n\nim\np\n\nlifie\nd\n o\n\nn\nlin\n\ne\n s\n\nim\nu\nla\n\ntio\nn\n o\n\nf a\n n\n\nu\nc\nle\n\na\nr re\n\na\nc\nto\n\nr\n\nh\nttp\n\n://e\nsa\n\n2\n1\n.k\n\ne\nn\nn\ne\nsa\n\nw\n.e\n\nd\nu\n/a\n\nc\ntiv\n\nitie\ns/n\n\nu\nk\ne\ne\nn\ne\nrg\n\ny\n/n\n\nu\nk\ne\n.h\n\ntm\n\nFIGURE 13.5 Schematic diagram of a nuclear reactor based on\nthermal neutron fission.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n456\n\nIn the first reaction, two protons combine to form a deuteron and\na positron with a release of 0.42 MeV energy. In reaction [13.29(b)], two\ndeuterons combine to form the light isotope of helium. In reaction\n(13.29c), two deuterons combine to form a triton and a proton. For\nfusion to take place, the two nuclei must come close enough so that\nattractive short-range nuclear force is able to affect them. However,\nsince they are both positively charged particles, they experience coulomb\nrepulsion. They, therefore, must have enough energy to overcome this\ncoulomb barrier. The height of the barrier depends on the charges and\nradii of the two interacting nuclei. It can be shown, for example, that\nthe barrier height for two protons is ~ 400 keV, and is higher for nuclei\nwith higher charges. We can estimate the temperature at which two\nprotons in a proton gas would (averagely) have enough energy to\novercome the coulomb barrier:\n\n(3/2)k T = K �  400 keV, which gives T ~ 3 × 10\n9\n K.\n\nWhen fusion is achieved by raising the temperature of the system so\nthat particles have enough kinetic energy to overcome the coulomb\nrepulsive behaviour, it is called thermonuclear fusion.\n\nThermonuclear fusion is the source of energy output in the interior\nof stars. The interior of the sun has a temperature of 1.5×10\n\n7\n K, which\n\nis considerably less than the estimated temperature required for fusion\nof particles of average energy. Clearly, fusion in the sun involves protons\nwhose energies are much above the average energy.\n\nThe fusion reaction in the sun is a multi-step process in which the\nhydrogen is burned into helium. Thus, the fuel in the sun is the hydrogen\nin its core. The proton-proton (p, p) cycle by which this occurs is\nrepresented by the following sets of reactions:\n\n1 1 2\n1 1 1H H H+ → + e\n\n+\n + ν + 0.42 MeV (i)\n\ne\n+\n + e\n\n–\n → γ + γ + 1.02 MeV (ii)\n\n2 1 3\n1 1 2H H He+ → + γ + 5.49 MeV (iii)\n\n+ → + +\n3 3 4 1 1\n2 2 2 1 1He He He H H + 12.86 MeV (iv) (13.30)\n\nFor the fourth reaction to occur, the first three reactions must occur\n\ntwice, in which case two light helium nuclei unite to form ordinary helium\nnucleus. If we consider the combination 2(i) + 2(ii) + 2(iii) +(iv), the net\neffect is\n\n1 4\n1 24 H 2 He 2 6 26.7 MeVe ν γ\n\n−\n+ → + + +\n\nor 1 4\n1 2(4 H 4 ) ( He 2 ) 2 6 26.7MeVe e ν γ\n\n− −\n+ → + + + + (13.31)\n\nThus, four hydrogen atoms combine to form an 4\n2He  atom with a\n\nrelease of 26.7 MeV of energy.\n\nHelium is not the only element that can be synthesized in the interior\nof a star. As the hydrogen in the core gets depleted and becomes  helium,\n\nthe core starts to cool. The star begins to collapse under its own gravity\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n457\n\nNuclei\n\nwhich increases the temperature of the core. If this temperature increases\nto about 10\n\n8\n K, fusion takes place again, this time of helium nuclei into\n\ncarbon. This kind of process can generate through fusion higher and\n\nhigher mass number elements. But elements more massive than those\nnear the peak of the binding energy curve in Fig. 13.1 cannot be so\nproduced.\n\nThe age of the sun is about 5×10\n9\n y and it is estimated that there is\n\nenough hydrogen in the sun to keep it going for another 5 billion years.\nAfter that, the hydrogen burning will stop and the sun will begin to cool\n\nand will start to collapse under gravity, which will raise the core\ntemperature. The outer envelope of the sun will expand, turning it into\nthe so called red giant.\n\nNUCLEAR HOLOCAUST\n\nIn a single uranium fission about 0.9×235 MeV (≈200 MeV) of energy is liberated. If\neach nucleus of about 50 kg of \n\n235\nU undergoes fission the amount of energy involved is\n\nabout 4 × 10\n15\n\nJ. This energy is equivalent to about 20,000 tons of TNT, enough for a\nsuperexplosion. Uncontrolled release of large nuclear energy is called an atomic explosion.\nOn August 6, 1945 an atomic device was used in warfare for the first time. The US\n\ndropped an atom bomb on Hiroshima, Japan. The explosion was equivalent to 20,000\ntons of TNT. Instantly the radioactive products devastated 10 sq km of the city which\nhad 3,43,000 inhabitants. Of this number 66,000 were killed and 69,000 were injured;\n\nmore than 67% of the city’s structures were destroyed.\nHigh temperature conditions for fusion reactions can be created by exploding a fission\n\nbomb. Super-explosions equivalent to 10 megatons of explosive power of TNT were tested\n\nin 1954. Such bombs which involve fusion of isotopes of hydrogen, deuterium and tritium\nare called hydrogen bombs. It is estimated that a nuclear arsenal sufficient to destroy\nevery form of life on this planet several times over is in position to be triggered by the\n\npress of a button. Such a nuclear holocaust will not only destroy the life that exists now\nbut its radioactive fallout will make this planet unfit for life for all times. Scenarios based\non theoretical calculations predict a long nuclear winter, as the radioactive waste will\n\nhang like a cloud in the earth’s atmosphere and will absorb the sun’s radiation.\n\n13.7.4  Controlled thermonuclear fusion\n\nThe natural thermonuclear fusion process in a star is replicated in a\nthermonuclear fusion device. In controlled fusion reactors, the aim is to\n\ngenerate steady power by heating the nuclear fuel to a temperature in the\nrange of 10\n\n8\n K. At these temperatures, the fuel is a mixture of positive\n\nions and electrons (plasma). The challenge is to confine this plasma, since\n\nno container can stand such a high temperature. Several countries\naround the world including India are developing techniques in this\nconnection. If successful, fusion reactors will hopefully supply almost\n\nunlimited power to humanity.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n458  E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n3\n.7\n\nExample 13.7 Answer the following questions:\n\n(a) Are the equations of nuclear reactions (such as those given in\nSection 13.7) ‘balanced’ in the sense a chemical equation (e.g.,\n\n2H\n2\n + O\n\n2\n→ 2 H\n\n2\nO)  is? If not, in what sense are they balanced on\n\nboth sides?\n\n(b) If both the number of protons and the number of neutrons are\nconserved in each nuclear reaction, in what way is mass converted\ninto energy (or vice-versa) in a nuclear reaction?\n\n(c) A general impression exists that  mass-energy interconversion\ntakes place only in nuclear reaction and never in chemical\n\nreaction. This is strictly speaking, incorrect. Explain.\n\nSolution\n\n(a) A chemical equation is balanced in the sense that the number of\n\natoms of each element is the same on both sides of the equation.\n\nA chemical reaction merely alters the original combinations of\n\natoms. In a nuclear reaction, elements may be transmuted. Thus,\n\nthe number of atoms of each element is not necessarily conserved\n\nin a nuclear reaction. However, the number of protons and the\n\nnumber of neutrons are both separately conserved in a nuclear\n\nreaction. [Actually, even this is not strictly true in the realm of\n\nvery high energies – what is strictly conserved is the total charge\n\nand total ‘baryon number’. We need not pursue this matter here.]\n\nIn nuclear reactions (e.g., Eq. 13.26), the number of protons and\n\nthe number of neutrons are the same on the two sides of the equation.\n\n(b) We know that the binding energy of a nucleus gives a negative\n\ncontribution to the mass of the nucleus (mass defect). Now, since\n\nproton number and neutron number are conserved in a nuclear\n\nreaction, the total rest mass of neutrons and protons is the same\n\non either side of a reaction. But the total binding energy of nuclei\n\non the left side need not be the same as that on the right hand\n\nside. The difference in these binding energies appears as energy\n\nreleased or absorbed in a nuclear reaction. Since binding energy\n\ncontributes to mass, we say that the difference in the total mass\n\nof nuclei on the two sides get converted into energy or vice-versa.\n\nIt is in these sense that a nuclear reaction is an example of mass-\n\nenergy interconversion.\n\n(c) From the point of view of mass-energy interconversion, a chemical\n\nreaction is similar to a nuclear reaction in principle. The energy\n\nreleased or absorbed in a chemical reaction can be traced to the\n\ndifference in chemical (not nuclear) binding energies of atoms and\n\nmolecules on the two sides of a reaction. Since, strictly speaking,\n\nchemical binding energy also gives a negative contribution (mass\n\ndefect) to the total mass of an atom or molecule, we can equally\n\nwell say that the difference in the total mass of atoms or molecules,\n\non the two sides of the chemical reaction gets converted into energy\n\nor vice-versa. However, the mass defects involved in a chemical\n\nreaction are almost a million times smaller than those in a nuclear\n\nreaction.This is the reason for the general impression, (which is\n\nincorrect ) that mass-energy interconversion does not take place\n\nin a chemical reaction.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n459\n\nNuclei\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. An atom has a nucleus. The nucleus is positively charged. The radius\n\nof the nucleus is smaller than the radius of an atom by a factor of\n\n10\n4\n. More than 99.9% mass of the atom is concentrated in the nucleus.\n\n2. On the atomic scale, mass is measured in atomic mass units (u). By\ndefinition, 1 atomic mass unit (1u) is 1/12th mass of one atom of 12C;\n\n1u = 1.660563 × 10\n–27\n\n kg.\n\n3. A nucleus contains a neutral particle called neutron. Its mass is almost\n\nthe same as that of proton\n\n4. The atomic number Z is the number of protons in the atomic nucleus\n\nof an element. The mass number A is the total number of protons and\nneutrons in the atomic nucleus; A = Z+N; Here N denotes the number\n\nof neutrons in the nucleus.\n\nA nuclear species or a nuclide is represented as  X\nA\nZ , where X is the\n\nchemical symbol of the species.\n\nNuclides with the same atomic number Z, but different neutron number\n\nN are called isotopes. Nuclides with the same A are isobars and those\n\nwith the same N are isotones.\n\nMost elements are mixtures of two or more isotopes. The atomic mass\n\nof an element is a weighted average of the masses of its isotopes and\n\ncalculated in accordance to the relative abundances of the isotopes.\n\n5. A nucleus can be considered to be spherical in shape and assigned a\n\nradius. Electron scattering experiments allow determination of the\n\nnuclear radius; it is found that radii of nuclei fit the formula\n\nR = R\n0\n A\n\n1/3\n,\n\nwhere R\n0\n = a constant = 1.2 fm. This implies that the nuclear density\n\nis independent of A. It is of the order of 10\n17\n\n kg/m\n3\n.\n\n6. Neutrons and protons are bound in a nucleus by the short-range strong\n\nnuclear force. The nuclear force does not distinguish between neutron\n\nand proton.\n\n7. The nuclear mass M is always less than the total mass, Σm, of its\n\nconstituents. The difference in mass of a nucleus and its constituents\n\nis called the mass defect,\n\n∆M = (Z m\np\n + (A – Z )m\n\nn\n) – M\n\nUsing Einstein’s mass energy relation, we express this mass difference\n\nin terms of energy as\n\n∆E\nb\n = ∆M c\n\n2\n\nThe energy ∆E\nb\n represents the binding energy of the nucleus. In the\n\nmass number range A = 30 to 170, the binding energy per nucleon is\n\nnearly constant, about 8 MeV/nucleon.\n\n8. Energies associated with nuclear processes are about a million times\n\nlarger than chemical process.\n\n9. The Q-value of a nuclear process is\n\n      Q = final kinetic energy – initial kinetic energy.\n\nDue to conservation of mass-energy, this is also,\n\nQ = (sum of initial masses – sum of final masses)c\n2\n\n10. Radioactivity is the phenomenon in which nuclei of a given species\n\ntransform by giving out α or β or γ rays; α-rays are helium nuclei;\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n460\n\nβ-rays are electrons. γ-rays are electromagnetic radiation of wavelengths\nshorter than X-rays;\n\n11. Law of radioactive decay : N (t) = N(0) e–λt\n\nwhere λ is the decay constant or disintegration constant.\n\nThe half-life T\n1/2\n\n of a radionuclide is the time in which N has been\n\nreduced to one-half of its initial value. The mean life τ is the time at\nwhich N has been reduced to e\n\n–1\n of its initial value\n\n1/2\n\nln 2\nln 2T τ\n\nλ\n= =\n\n12. Energy is released when less tightly bound nuclei are transmuted into\n\nmore tightly bound nuclei. In fission, a heavy nucleus like \n235\n92 U  breaks\n\ninto two smaller fragments, e.g., 235 1 133 99 1\n92 0 51 41 0U+ n Sb Nb + 4 n→ +\n\n13. The fact that more neutrons are produced in fission than are consumed\n\ngives the possibility of a chain reaction with each neutron that is\nproduced triggering another fission. The chain reaction is uncontrolled\n\nand rapid in a nuclear bomb explosion. It is controlled and steady in\n\na nuclear reactor. In a reactor, the value of the neutron multiplication\n\nfactor k is maintained at 1.\n\n14. In fusion, lighter nuclei combine to form a larger nucleus. Fusion of\n\nhydrogen nuclei into helium nuclei is the source of energy of all stars\nincluding our sun.\n\nPhysical Quantity Symbol Dimensions Units Remarks\n\nAtomic mass unit [M] u Unit of mass for\nexpressing atomic or\n\nnuclear masses.

The density of nuclear matter is independent of the size of the nucleus.\n\nThe mass density of the atom does not follow this rule.\n\n2. The radius of a nucleus determined by electron scattering is found to\n\nbe slightly different from that determined by alpha-particle scattering.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n461\n\nNuclei\n\nThis is because electron scattering senses the charge distribution of\n\nthe nucleus, whereas alpha and similar particles sense the nuclear\n\nmatter.\n\n3. After Einstein showed the equivalence of mass and energy, E = mc\n2\n,\n\nwe cannot any longer speak of separate laws of conservation of mass\n\nand conservation of energy, but we have to speak of a unified law of\n\nconservation of mass and energy. The most convincing evidence that\n\nthis principle operates in nature comes from nuclear physics. It is\n\ncentral to our understanding of nuclear energy and harnessing it as a\n\nsource of power. Using the principle, Q of a nuclear process (decay or\n\nreaction) can be expressed also in terms of initial and final masses.\n\n4. The nature of the binding energy (per nucleon) curve shows that\n\nexothermic nuclear reactions are possible, when two light nuclei fuse\n\nor when a heavy nucleus undergoes fission into nuclei with intermediate\n\nmass.\n\n5. For fusion, the light nuclei must have sufficient initial energy to\n\novercome the coulomb potential barrier. That is why fusion requires\n\nvery high temperatures.\n\n6. Although the binding energy (per nucleon) curve is smooth and slowly\n\nvarying, it shows peaks at nuclides like \n4\nHe, \n\n16\nO etc. This is considered\n\nas evidence of atom-like shell structure in nuclei.\n\n7. Electrons and positron are a particle-antiparticle pair. They are\n\nidentical in mass; their charges are equal in magnitude and opposite.\n\n( It is found that when an electron and a positron come together, they\n\nannihilate each other giving energy in the form of gamma-ray photons.)\n\n8. In â\n-\n-decay (electron emission), the particle emitted along with electron\n\nis anti-neutrino (ν ). On the other hand, the particle emitted in β\n+\n-\n\ndecay (positron emission) is neutrino (ν). Neutrino and anti-neutrino\n\nare a particle-antiparticle pair. There are anti particles associated\n\nwith every particle. What should be antiproton which is the anti\n\nparticle of the proton?\n\n9. A free neutron is unstable ( –n p e ν→ + + ). But a similar free proton\ndecay is not possible, since a proton is (slightly) lighter than a neutron.\n\n10. Gamma emission usually follows alpha or beta emission. A nucleus\n\nin an excited (higher) state goes to a lower state by emitting a gamma\n\nphoton. A nucleus may be left in an excited state after alpha or beta\n\nemission. Successive emission of gamma rays from the same nucleus\n\n(as in case of \n60\n\nNi, Fig. 13.4) is a clear proof that nuclei also have\n\ndiscrete energy levels as do the atoms.\n\n11. Radioactivity is an indication of the instability of nuclei. Stability\n\nrequires the ratio of neutron to proton to be around 1:1 for light\n\nnuclei. This ratio increases to about 3:2 for heavy nuclei. (More\n\nneutrons are required to overcome the effect of repulsion among the\n\nprotons.) Nuclei which are away from the stability ratio, i.e., nuclei\n\nwhich have an excess of neutrons  or protons are unstable. In fact,\n\nonly about 10% of knon isotopes (of all elements), are stable. Others\n\nhave been either artificially produced in the laboratory by bombarding\n\nα, p, d, n or other particles on targets of stable nuclear species or\n\nidentified in astronomical observations of matter in the universe.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n462\n\nEXERCISES\n\nYou may find the following data useful in solving the exercises:\n\ne = 1.6×10\n–19\n\nC N = 6.023×10\n23\n\n per mole\n1/(4πε\n\n0\n) = 9 × 109 N m2/C2 k = 1.381×10–23J K–1\n\n1 MeV = 1.6×10\n–13\n\nJ 1 u = 931.5 MeV/c\n2\n\n1 year = 3.154×107 s\n\nm\nH\n\n= 1.007825 u m\nn\n\n= 1.008665 u\n\nm( 4\n2He ) = 4.002603 u me = 0.000548 u\n\n13.1 (a) Two stable isotopes of lithium 6\n3 Li  and \n\n7\n3 Li  have respective\n\nabundances of 7.5% and 92.5%.
