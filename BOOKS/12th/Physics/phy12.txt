In 1897, the experiments on electric discharge\nthrough gases carried out by the English physicist J. J. Thomson (1856 –\n1940) revealed that atoms of different elements contain negatively charged\nconstituents (electrons) that are identical for all atoms. However, atoms on a\nwhole are electrically neutral. Therefore, an atom must also contain some\npositive charge to neutralise the negative charge of the electrons. But what\nis the arrangement of the positive charge and the electrons inside the atom?\nIn other words, what is the structure of an atom?\n\nThe first model of atom was proposed by J. J. Thomson in 1898.\nAccording to this model, the positive charge of the atom is uniformly\ndistributed throughout the volume of the atom and the negatively charged\nelectrons are embedded in it like seeds in a watermelon. This model was\npicturesquely called plum pudding model of the atom. However\nsubsequent studies on atoms, as described in this chapter, showed that\nthe distribution of the electrons and positive charges are very different\nfrom that proposed in this model.\n\nWe know that condensed matter (solids and liquids) and dense gases at\nall temperatures emit electromagnetic radiation in which a continuous\ndistribution of several wavelengths is present, though with different\nintensities. This radiation is considered to be due to oscillations of atoms\n\nChapter Twelve\n\nATOMS\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n415\n\nAtoms\n\nand molecules, governed by the interaction of each atom or\nmolecule with its neighbours. In contrast, light emitted from\nrarefied gases heated in a flame, or excited electrically in a\nglow tube such as the familiar neon sign or mercury vapour\nlight has only certain discrete wavelengths. The spectrum\nappears as a series of bright lines. In such gases, the\naverage spacing between atoms is large. Hence, the\nradiation emitted can be considered due to individual atoms\nrather than because of interactions between atoms or\nmolecules.\n\nIn the early nineteenth century it was also established\nthat each element is associated with a characteristic\nspectrum of radiation, for example, hydrogen always gives\na set of lines with fixed relative position between the lines.\nThis fact suggested an intimate relationship between the\ninternal structure of an atom and the spectrum of\nradiation emitted by it. In 1885, Johann Jakob Balmer\n(1825 – 1898) obtained a simple empirical formula which\ngave the wavelengths of a group of lines emitted by atomic\nhydrogen. Since hydrogen is simplest of the elements\nknown, we shall consider its spectrum in detail in this\nchapter.\n\nErnst Rutherford (1871–1937), a former research\nstudent of J. J. Thomson, was engaged in experiments on\nα-particles emitted by some radioactive elements. In 1906,\nhe proposed a classic experiment of scattering of these\nα-particles by atoms to investigate the atomic structure.\nThis experiment was later performed around 1911 by Hans\nGeiger (1882–1945) and Ernst Marsden (1889–1970, who\nwas 20 year-old student and had not yet earned his\nbachelor’s degree). The details are discussed in Section\n12.2. The explanation of the results led to the birth of\nRutherford’s planetary model of atom (also called the\nnuclear model of the atom). According to this the entire\npositive charge and most of the mass of the atom is\nconcentrated in a small volume called the nucleus with electrons revolving\naround the nucleus just as planets revolve around the sun.\n\nRutherford’s nuclear model was a major step towards how we see\nthe atom today. However, it could not explain why atoms emit light of\nonly discrete wavelengths. How could an atom as simple as hydrogen,\nconsisting of a single electron and a single proton, emit a complex\nspectrum of specific wavelengths? In the classical picture of an atom, the\nelectron revolves round the nucleus much like the way a planet revolves\nround the sun. However, we shall see that there are some serious\ndifficulties in accepting such a model.\n\n12.2 ALPHA-PARTICLE SCATTERING AND\nRUTHERFORD’S NUCLEAR MODEL OF ATOM\n\nAt the suggestion of Ernst Rutherford, in 1911, H. Geiger and E. Marsden\nperformed some experiments. In one of their experiments, as shown in\n\nErnst Rutherford (1871 –\n1937)  New Zealand born,\nBritish physicist who did\npioneering work on\nradioactive radiation. He\ndiscovered alpha-rays and\nbeta-rays. Along with\nFederick Soddy, he created\nthe modern theory of\nradioactivity. He studied\nthe ‘emanation’ of thorium\nand discovered a new noble\ngas, an isotope of radon,\nnow known as thoron. By\nscattering alpha-rays from\nthe metal foils, he\ndiscovered the atomic\nnucleus and proposed the\nplenatery model of the\natom. He also estimated the\napproximate size of the\nnucleus.\n\nE\nR\n\nN\nS\n\nT\n R\n\nU\nT\nH\n\nE\nR\n\nF\nO\n\nR\nD\n\n (1\n8\n7\n1\n – 1\n\n9\n3\n7\n)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n416\n\nFig. 12.1, they directed a beam of\n5.5 MeV α-particles emitted from a\n214\n83Bi  radioactive source at a thin metal\n\nfoil made of gold. Figure 12.2 shows a\nschematic diagram of this experiment.\nAlpha-particles emitted by a 214\n\n83Bi\nradioactive source were collimated into\na narrow beam by their passage\nthrough lead bricks. The beam was\nallowed to fall on a thin foil of gold of\nthickness 2.1 × 10–7 m. The scattered\nalpha-particles were observed through\na rotatable detector consisting of zinc\nsulphide screen and a microscope. The\nscattered alpha-particles on striking\nthe screen produced brief light flashes\nor scintillations. These flashes may be\nviewed through a microscope and the\ndistribution of the number of scattered\nparticles may be studied as a function\nof angle of scattering.\n\nFIGURE 12.2 Schematic arrangement of the Geiger-Marsden experiment.\n\nA typical graph of the total number of α-particles scattered at different\nangles, in a given interval of time, is shown in Fig. 12.3. The dots in this\nfigure represent the data points and the solid curve is the theoretical\nprediction based on the assumption that the target atom has a small,\ndense, positively charged nucleus. Many of the α-particles pass through\nthe foil. It means that they do not suffer any collisions. Only about 0.14%\nof the incident α-particles scatter by more than 1°; and about 1 in 8000\ndeflect by more than 90°. Rutherford argued that, to deflect the α-particle\nbackwards, it must experience a large repulsive force. This force could\n\nFIGURE 12.1 Geiger-Marsden scattering experiment.\nThe entire apparatus is placed in a vacuum chamber\n\n(not shown in this figure).\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n417\n\nAtoms\n\nbe provided if the greater part of the\nmass of the atom and its positive charge\nwere concentrated tightly at its centre.\nThen the incoming α-particle could get\nvery close to the positive charge without\npenetrating it, and such a close\nencounter would result in a large\ndeflection. This agreement supported\nthe hypothesis of the nuclear atom. This\nis why Rutherford is credited with the\ndiscovery of the nucleus.\n\nIn Rutherford’s nuclear model of\nthe atom, the entire positive charge and\nmost of the mass of the atom are\nconcentrated in the nucleus with the\nelectrons some distance away. The\nelectrons would be moving in orbits\nabout the nucleus just as the planets\ndo around the sun. Rutherford’s\nexperiments suggested the size of\nthe nucleus to be about 10–15 m to\n10–14 m. From kinetic theory, the size\nof an atom was known to be 10–10 m,\nabout 10,000 to 100,000 times larger\nthan the size of the nucleus (see Chapter 11, Section 11.6 in Class XI\nPhysics textbook). Thus, the electrons would seem to be at a distance\nfrom the nucleus of about 10,000 to 100,000 times the size of the nucleus\nitself. Thus, most of an atom is empty space. With the atom being largely\nempty space, it is easy to see why most α-particles go right through a\nthin metal foil. However, when α-particle happens to come near a nucleus,\nthe intense electric field there scatters it through a large angle. The atomic\nelectrons, being so light, do not appreciably affect the α-particles.\n\nThe scattering data shown in Fig. 12.3 can be analysed by employing\nRutherford’s nuclear model of the atom. As the gold foil is very thin, it\ncan be assumed that α-particles will suffer not more than one scattering\nduring their passage through it. Therefore, computation of the trajectory\nof an alpha-particle scattered by a single nucleus is enough. Alpha-\nparticles are nuclei of helium atoms and, therefore, carry two units, 2e,\nof positive charge and have the mass of the helium atom. The charge of\nthe gold nucleus is Ze, where Z is the atomic number of the atom; for\ngold Z = 79. Since the nucleus of gold is about 50 times heavier than an\nα-particle, it is reasonable to assume that it remains stationary\nthroughout the scattering process. Under these assumptions, the\ntrajectory of an alpha-particle can be computed employing Newton’s\nsecond law of motion and the Coulomb’s law for electrostatic\nforce of repulsion between the alpha-particle and the positively\ncharged nucleus.\n\nFIGURE 12.3 Experimental data points (shown by\ndots) on scattering of α-particles by a thin foil at\ndifferent angles obtained by Geiger and Marsden\n\nusing the setup shown in Figs. 12.1 and\n12.2. Rutherford’s nuclear model predicts the solid\ncurve which is seen to be in good agreement with\n\nexperiment.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n418  E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n2\n.1\n\nThe magnitude of this force is\n\n2\n0\n\n(2 )( )1\n4\n\ne Ze\nF\n\nrε\n=\n\nπ\n(12.1)\n\nwhere r is the distance between the α-particle and the nucleus. The force\nis directed along the line joining the α-particle and the nucleus. The\nmagnitude and direction of the force on an α-particle continuously\nchanges as it approaches the nucleus and recedes away from it.\n\n12.2.1  Alpha-particle trajectory\n\nThe trajectory traced by an α-particle depends on the impact parameter,\nb of collision. The impact parameter is the perpendicular distance of the\ninitial velocity vector of the α-particle from the centre of the nucleus (Fig.\n\n12.4). A given beam of α-particles has a\ndistribution of impact parameters b, so that\nthe beam is scattered in various directions\nwith different probabilities (Fig. 12.4). (In\na beam, all particles have nearly same\nkinetic energy.) It is seen that an α-particle\nclose to the nucleus (small impact\nparameter) suffers large scattering. In case\nof head-on collision, the impact parameter\nis minimum and the α-particle rebounds\nback (θ  ≅ π). For a large impact parameter,\nthe α-particle goes nearly undeviated and\nhas a small deflection (θ  ≅ 0).\n\nThe fact that only a small fraction of the\nnumber of incident particles rebound back\nindicates that the number of α-particles\nundergoing head on collision is small. This,\n\nin turn, implies that the mass and positive charge of the atom is\nconcentrated in a small volume. Rutherford scattering therefore, is a\npowerful way to determine an upper limit to the size of the nucleus.\n\nFIGURE 12.4 Trajectory of α-particles in the\ncoulomb field of a target nucleus. The impact\n\nparameter, b and scattering angle θ\nare also depicted.\n\nExample 12.1 In the Rutherford’s nuclear model of the atom, the\nnucleus (radius about 10–15 m) is analogous to the sun about which\nthe electron move in orbit (radius ≈ 10–10 m) like the earth orbits\naround the sun. If the dimensions of the solar system had the same\nproportions as those of the atom, would the earth be closer to or\nfarther away from the sun than actually it is? The radius of earth’s\norbit is about 1.5 × 1011 m. The radius of sun is taken as 7 × 108 m.\n\nSolution The ratio of the radius of electron’s orbit to the radius of\nnucleus is (10–10 m)/(10–15 m) = 105, that is, the radius of the electron’s\norbit is 105 times larger than the radius of nucleus. If the radius of\nthe earth’s orbit around the sun were 105 times larger than the radius\nof the sun, the radius of the earth’s orbit would be 105 × 7 × 108 m =\n7 × 1013 m. This is more than 100 times greater than the actual\norbital radius of earth. Thus, the earth would be much farther away\nfrom the sun.\nIt implies that an atom contains a much greater fraction of empty\nspace than our solar system does.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n419\n\nAtoms\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n2\n.2\n\nExample 12.2 In a Geiger-Marsden experiment, what is the distance\nof closest approach to the nucleus of a 7.7 MeV α-particle before it\ncomes momentarily to rest and reverses its direction?\n\nSolution The key idea here is that throughout the scattering process,\nthe total mechanical energy of the system consisting of an α-particle\nand a gold nucleus is conserved. The system’s initial mechanical\nenergy is E\n\ni\n, before the particle and nucleus interact, and it is equal\n\nto its mechanical energy E\nf\n when the α-particle momentarily stops.\n\nThe initial energy E\ni\n is just the kinetic energy K\n\n \nof the incoming\n\nα- particle. The final energy E\nf\n is just the electric potential energy U\n\nof the system. The potential energy U  can be calculated from\nEq. (12.1).\nLet d be the centre-to-centre distance between the α-particle and\nthe gold nucleus when the α-particle is at its stopping point. Then\nwe can write the conservation of energy E\n\ni\n = E\n\nf\n as\n\n2\n\n0 0\n\n1 (2 )( ) 2\n4 4\n\ne Ze Ze\nK\n\nddε ε\n= =\n\nπ π\n\nThus the distance of closest approach d is given by\n2\n\n0\n\n2\n4\n\nZe\nd\n\nKε\n=\n\nπ\n\nThe maximum kinetic energy found in α-particles of natural origin is\n7.7 MeV or 1.2 × 10–12 J. Since 1/4πε\n\n0\n = 9.0 × 109 N m2/C2. Therefore\n\nwith e = 1.6 × 10–19 C, we have,\n9 2 2 –19 2\n\n12\n\n(2)(9.0 10 Nm / )(1.6 10 ) Z\n\n1.2 10 J\n\nC C\nd\n\n−\n\n× ×\n=\n\n×\n\n   = 3.84 × 10–16 Z m\nThe atomic number of foil material gold is Z = 79, so that\n\nd (Au) = 3.0 × 10–14 m = 30 fm. (1 fm (i.e. fermi) = 10–15 m.)\n\nThe radius of gold nucleus is, therefore, less than 3.0 × 10–14 m. This\nis not in very good agreement with the observed result as the actual\nradius of gold nucleus is 6 fm. The cause of discrepancy is that the\ndistance of closest approach is considerably larger than the sum of\nthe radii of the gold nucleus and the α-particle. Thus, the α-particle\nreverses its motion without ever actually touching the gold nucleus.\n\n12.2.2  Electron orbits\n\nThe Rutherford nuclear model of the atom which involves classical\nconcepts, pictures the atom as an electrically neutral sphere consisting\nof a very small, massive and positively charged nucleus at the centre\nsurrounded by the revolving electrons in their respective dynamically\nstable orbits. The electrostatic force of attraction, F\n\ne\n between the revolving\n\nelectrons and the nucleus provides the requisite centripetal force  (F\nc\n)  to\n\nkeep them in their orbits. Thus, for a  dynamically stable orbit in a\nhydrogen atom\n\n    F\ne\n = F\n\nc\n\n2 2\n\n2\n0\n\n1\n4 ε\n\n=\nπ\n\ne mv\n\nrr\n(12.2)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n420\n\nThus the relation between the orbit radius and the electron\nvelocity is\n\n2\n\n2\n04\ne\n\nr\nmvε\n\n=\nπ\n\n(12.3)\n\nThe kinetic energy (K ) and electrostatic potential energy (U ) of the electron\nin hydrogen atom are\n\n2 2\n2\n\n0 0\n\n1\n and \n\n2 8 4\ne e\n\nK mv U\nr rε ε\n\n= = = −\nπ π\n\n(The negative sign in U signifies that the electrostatic force is in the –r\ndirection.) Thus the total energy E of the electron in a hydrogen atom is\n\n2 2\n\n0 08 4\ne e\n\nE K U\nr rε ε\n\n= + = −\nπ π\n\n                 \n2\n\n08\ne\n\nrε\n= −\n\nπ\n(12.4)\n\nThe total energy of the electron is negative. This implies the fact that\nthe electron is bound to the nucleus. If E were positive, an electron will\nnot follow a closed orbit around the nucleus.\n\n12.3  ATOMIC SPECTRA\nAs mentioned in Section 12.1, each element has a characteristic spectrum\nof radiation, which it emits. When an atomic gas or vapour is excited at\nlow pressure, usually by passing an electric current through it, the emitted\nradiation has a spectrum which contains certain specific wavelengths\nonly. A spectrum of this kind is termed as emission line spectrum and it\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n2\n.3\n\nExample 12.3 It is found experimentally that 13.6 eV energy is\nrequired to separate a hydrogen atom into a proton and an electron.\nCompute the orbital radius and the velocity of the electron in a\nhydrogen atom.\n\nSolution Total energy of the electron in hydrogen atom is –13.6 eV =\n–13.6 × 1.6 × 10–19 J = –2.2 ×10–18 J.

The\nspectrum emitted by atomic\nhydrogen is shown in\nFig. 12.5. Study of emission\nline spectra of a material can\ntherefore serve as a type of\n“fingerprint” for identification\nof the gas. When white light\npasses through a gas and we\nanalyse the transmitted light\nusing a spectrometer we find\nsome dark lines in the\nspectrum. These dark lines\ncorrespond precisely to those wavelengths which were found in the\nemission line spectrum of the gas. This is called the absorption spectrum\nof the material of the gas.\n\n12.3.1  Spectral series\n\nWe might expect that the frequencies of the light emitted by a particular\nelement would exhibit some regular pattern. Hydrogen is the simplest\natom and therefore, has the simplest spectrum. In the observed spectrum,\nhowever, at first sight, there does not seem to be\nany resemblance of order or regularity in spectral\nlines. But the spacing between lines within certain\nsets of the hydrogen spectrum decreases in a\nregular way (Fig. 12.5). Each of these sets is called\na spectral series. In 1885, the first such series was\nobserved by a Swedish school teacher Johann Jakob\nBalmer (1825–1898) in the visible region of the\nhydrogen spectrum. This series is called Balmer\nseries (Fig. 12.6). The line with the longest\nwavelength, 656.3 nm in the red is called H\n\nα\n;\n \nthe\n\nnext line with wavelength 486.1 nm in the blue-\ngreen is called H\n\nβ\n, the third line 434.1 nm in the\n\nviolet is called H\nγ\n;\n \nand so on. As the wavelength\n\ndecreases, the lines appear closer together and are weaker in intensity.\nBalmer found a simple empirical formula for the observed wavelengths\n\n2 2\n\n1 1 1\n2\n\nR\nnλ\n\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n= −\uf8ec \uf8f7\uf8ed \uf8f8\n\n(12.5)\n\nwhere λ is the wavelength, R is a constant called the Rydberg constant,\nand n may have integral values 3, 4, 5, etc. The value of R is 1.097 × 107 m–1.\nThis equation is also called Balmer formula.\n\nTaking n = 3 in Eq.

This is the shortest wavelength in\nthe Balmer series. Beyond this limit, no further distinct lines appear,\ninstead only a faint continuous spectrum is seen.\n\nOther series of spectra for hydrogen were subsequently discovered.\nThese are known, after their discoverers, as Lyman, Paschen, Brackett,\nand Pfund series.

However, these results are empirical\nand do not give any reasoning why only certain frequencies are observed\nin the hydrogen spectrum.\n\n12.4  BOHR MODEL OF THE HYDROGEN ATOM\nThe model of the atom proposed by Rutherford assumes that the atom,\nconsisting of a central nucleus and revolving electron is stable much like\nsun-planet system which the model imitates. However, there are some\nfundamental differences between the two situations. While the planetary\nsystem is held by gravitational force, the nucleus-electron system being\ncharged objects, interact by Coulomb’s Law of force. We know that an\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n423\n\nAtoms\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n2\n.4\n\nobject which moves in a circle is being constantly\naccelerated – the acceleration being centripetal in nature.\nAccording to classical electromagnetic theory, an\naccelerating charged particle emits radiation in the form\nof electromagnetic waves. The energy of an accelerating\nelectron should therefore, continuously decrease. The\nelectron would spiral inward and eventually fall into the\nnucleus (Fig. 12.7). Thus, such an atom can not be stable.\nFurther, according to the classical electromagnetic theory,\nthe frequency of the electromagnetic waves emitted by\nthe revolving electrons is equal to the frequency of\nrevolution. As the electrons spiral inwards, their angular\nvelocities and hence their frequencies would change\ncontinuously, and so will the frequency of the light\nemitted. Thus, they would emit a continuous spectrum,\nin contradiction to the line spectrum actually observed.\nClearly Rutherford model tells only a part of the story\nimplying that the classical ideas are not sufficient to\nexplain the atomic structure.\n\nFIGURE 12.7 An accelerated atomic electron must spiral into the\nnucleus as it loses energy.\n\nExample 12.4 According to the classical electromagnetic theory,\ncalculate the initial frequency of the light emitted by the electron\nrevolving around a proton in hydrogen atom.\n\nSolution From Example 12.3 we know that velocity of electron moving\naround a proton in hydrogen atom in an orbit of radius 5.3 × 10–11 m\nis 2.2 × 10–6 m/s. Thus, the frequency of the electron moving around\nthe proton is\n\n( )\n\n6 1\n\n11\n\n2.2 10  m s\n2 2 5.3 10  m\n\nv\n\nr\nν\n\n−\n\n−\n\n×\n= =\n\nπ π ×\n\n≈ 6.6 × 1015 Hz.\nAccording to the classical electromagnetic theory we know that the\nfrequency of the electromagnetic waves emitted by the revolving\nelectrons is equal to the frequency of its revolution around the nucleus.\nThus the initial frequency of the light emitted is 6.6 × 1015 Hz.\n\nNiels Henrik David Bohr\n\n(1885 – 1962)  Danish\nphysicist who explained the\nspectrum of hydrogen atom\nbased on quantum ideas.\nHe gave a theory of nuclear\nfission based on the liquid-\ndrop model of nucleus.\nBohr contributed to the\nclarification of conceptual\nproblems in quantum\nmechanics, in particular by\nproposing the comple-\nmentary principle.\n\nN\nIE\n\nL\nS\n\n H\nE\n\nN\nR\n\nIK\n D\n\nA\nV\n\nID\n B\n\nO\nH\n\nR\n (1\n\n8\n8\n5\n – 1\n\n9\n6\n2\n)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n424\n\nIt was Niels Bohr (1885 – 1962) who made certain modifications in\nthis model by adding the ideas of the newly developing quantum\nhypothesis. Niels Bohr studied in Rutherford’s laboratory for several\nmonths in 1912 and he was convinced about the validity of Rutherford\nnuclear model. Faced with the dilemma as discussed above, Bohr, in\n1913, concluded that in spite of the success of electromagnetic theory in\nexplaining large-scale phenomena, it could not be applied to the processes\nat the atomic scale. It became clear that a fairly radical departure from\nthe established principles of classical mechanics and electromagnetism\nwould be needed to understand the structure of atoms and the relation\nof atomic structure to atomic spectra. Bohr combined classical and early\nquantum concepts and gave his theory in the form of three postulates.\nThese are :\n\n(i) Bohr’s first postulate was that an electron in an atom could revolve\nin certain stable orbits without the emission of radiant energy,\ncontrary to the predictions of electromagnetic theory. According to\nthis postulate, each atom has certain definite stable states in which it\ncan exist, and each possible state has definite total energy. These are\ncalled the stationary states of the atom.\n\n(ii) Bohr’s second postulate defines these stable orbits. This postulate\nstates that the electron revolves around the nucleus only in those\norbits for which the angular momentum is some integral multiple of\n\nh/2π where h is the Planck’s constant (= 6.6 × 10–34 J s). Thus the\nangular momentum (L) of the orbiting electron is quantised. That is\n\nL = nh/2π (12.11)\n\n(iii) Bohr’s third postulate incorporated into atomic theory the early\nquantum concepts that had been developed by Planck and Einstein.\nIt states that an electron might make a transition from one of its\nspecified non-radiating orbits to another of lower energy. When it\n\ndoes so, a photon is emitted having energy equal to the energy\n\ndifference between the initial and final states. The frequency of the\nemitted photon is then given by\n\nhν  =   E\ni\n – E\n\nf\n(12.12)\n\nwhere E\ni\n and E\n\nf\n are the energies of the initial and final states and E\n\ni\n > E\n\nf\n.\n\nFor a hydrogen atom, Eq. (12.4) gives the expression to determine\nthe energies of different energy states. But then this equation requires\nthe radius r of the electron orbit. To calculate r, Bohr’s second postulate\nabout the angular momentum of the electron–the quantisation\ncondition – is used. The angular momentum L is given by\n\nL = mvr\n\nBohr’s second postulate of quantisation [Eq. (12.11)] says that the\nallowed values of angular momentum are integral multiples of h/2π.\n\nL\nn \n=\n\n \n mv\n\nn\nr\n\nn\n  = \n\n2\nnh\n\nπ\n(12.13)\n\nwhere n is an integer, r\nn\n is the radius of nth possible orbit and v\n\nn \nis the\n\nspeed of moving electron in the nth orbit. The allowed orbits are numbered\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n425\n\nAtoms\n\n1, 2, 3 ..., according to the values of n, which is called the principal\nquantum number of the orbit.\n\nFrom Eq.

(12.14) depicts that the orbital speed in the nth orbit falls by a factor\nof n. Using Eq.

(12.15), it can also be seen that the radii of the orbits increase as n2.\nThe total energy of the electron in the stationary states of the hydrogen\n\natom can be obtained by substituting the value of orbital radius in\nEq.

Energy will thus be\nrequired to remove the electron from the hydrogen atom to a distance\ninfinitely far away from its nucleus (or proton in hydrogen atom).\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n426  E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n2\n.5\n\nThe derivation of Eqs. (12.17) – (12.19) involves the assumption that\nthe electronic orbits are circular, though orbits under inverse square\nforce are, in general elliptical. (Planets move in elliptical orbits under the\ninverse square gravitational force of the sun.)  However, it was shown by\nthe German physicist Arnold Sommerfeld (1868 – 1951) that, when the\nrestriction of circular orbit is relaxed, these equations continue to hold\neven for elliptic orbits.\n\nORBIT VS STATE (ORBITAL PICTURE) OF ELECTRON IN ATOM\n\nWe are introduced to the Bohr Model of atom one time or the other in the course of\nphysics. This model has its place in the history of quantum mechanics and particularly\nin explaining the structure of an atom. It has become a milestone since Bohr introduced\nthe revolutionary idea of definite energy orbits for the electrons, contrary to the classical\npicture requiring an accelerating particle to radiate. Bohr also introduced the idea of\nquantisation of angular momentum of electrons moving in definite orbits. Thus it was a\nsemi-classical picture of the structure of atom.\n\nNow with the development of quantum mechanics, we have a better understanding\nof the structure of atom. Solutions of the Schrödinger wave equation assign a wave-like\ndescription to the electrons bound in an atom due to attractive forces of the protons.\n\nAn orbit of the electron in the Bohr model is the circular path of motion of an electron\naround the nucleus. But according to quantum mechanics, we cannot associate a definite\npath with the motion of the electrons in an atom. We can only talk about the probability\nof finding an electron in a certain region of space around the nucleus. This probability\ncan be inferred from the one-electron wave function called the orbital. This function\ndepends only on the coordinates of the electron.\n\nIt is therefore essential that we understand the subtle differences that exist in the two\nmodels:\nl Bohr model is valid for only one-electron atoms/ions; an energy value, assigned to\n\neach orbit, depends on the principal quantum number n in this model. We know\nthat energy associated with a stationary state of an electron depends on n only, for\none-electron atoms/ions. For a multi-electron atom/ion, this is not true.\n\nl The solution of the Schrödinger wave equation, obtained for hydrogen-like atoms/\nions, called the wave function, gives information about the probability of finding an\nelectron in various regions around the nucleus. This orbital has no resemblance\nwhatsoever with the orbit defined for an electron in the Bohr model.\n\nExample 12.5 A 10 kg satellite circles earth once every 2 h in an\norbit having a radius of 8000 km. Assuming that Bohr’s angular\nmomentum postulate applies to satellites just as it does to an electron\nin the hydrogen atom, find the quantum number of the orbit of the\nsatellite.\n\nSolution\n\nFrom Eq. (12.13), we have\nm v\n\nn \nr\n\nn\n = nh/2π\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n427\n\nAtoms\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n2\n.5\n\nHere m = 10 kg and r\nn = 8 × 10\n\n6 m. We have the time period T of the\ncircling satellite as 2 h. That is T = 7200 s.\nThus the velocity v\n\nn\n = 2π r\n\nn\n/T.\n\nThe quantum number of the orbit of satellite\nn\n\n \n= (2π r\n\nn\n)2 × m/(T × h).\n\nSubstituting the values,\nn = (2π × 8 × 106 m)2 × 10/(7200 s × 6.64 × 10–34 J s)\n   = 5.3 × 1045\n\nNote that the quantum number for the satellite motion is extremely\nlarge! In fact for such large quantum numbers the results of\nquantisation conditions tend to those of classical physics.\n\n12.4.1  Energy levels\n\nThe energy of an atom is the least (largest negative value)\nwhen its electron is revolving in an orbit closest to the\nnucleus i.e., the one for which n = 1. For n = 2, 3, ... the\nabsolute value of the energy E is smaller, hence the energy\nis progressively larger in the outer orbits. The lowest state\nof the atom, called the ground state, is that of the lowest\nenergy, with the electron revolving in the orbit of smallest\nradius, the Bohr radius, a\n\n0\n. The energy of this state (n = 1),\n\nE1 is –13.6 eV. Therefore, the minimum energy required to\nfree the electron from the ground state of the hydrogen atom\nis 13.6 eV. It is called the ionisation energy of the hydrogen\natom. This prediction of the Bohr’s model is in excellent\nagreement with the experimental value of ionisation energy.\n\nAt room temperature, most of the hydrogen atoms are\nin ground state. When a hydrogen atom receives energy\nby processes such as electron collisions, the atom may\nacquire sufficient energy to raise the electron to higher\nenergy states. The atom is then said to be in an excited\nstate. From Eq. (12.19), for n = 2; the energy E\n\n2\n is\n\n–3.40 eV. It means that the energy required to excite an\nelectron in hydrogen atom to its first excited state, is an\nenergy equal to E\n\n2\n – E\n\n1\n = –3.40 eV – (–13.6) eV = 10.2 eV.\n\nSimilarly, E\n3\n = –1.51 eV and E\n\n3\n – E\n\n1\n = 12.09 eV, or to excite\n\nthe hydrogen atom from its ground state (n = 1) to second\nexcited state (n = 3), 12.09 eV energy is required, and so\non. From these excited states the electron can then fall back\nto a state of lower energy, emitting a photon in the process.\nThus, as the excitation of hydrogen atom increases (that is\nas n increases) the value of minimum energy required to\nfree the electron from the excited atom decreases.\n\nThe energy level diagram* for the stationary states of a\nhydrogen atom, computed from Eq. (12.19), is given in\n\n* An electron can have any total energy above E = 0 eV. In such situations the\nelectron is free. Thus there is a continuum of energy states above E = 0 eV, as\nshown in Fig. 12.8.\n\nFIGURE 12.8 The energy level\ndiagram for the hydrogen atom.\nThe electron in a hydrogen atom\n\nat room temperature spends\nmost of its time in the ground\n\nstate. To ionise a hydrogen\natom an electron from the\n\nground state, 13.6 eV of energy\nmust be supplied. (The horizontal\n\nlines specify the presence of\nallowed energy states.)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n428\n\nFig. 12.8. The principal quantum number n labels the stationary\nstates in the ascending order of energy. In this diagram, the highest\nenergy state corresponds to n =∞ in Eq, (12.19) and has an energy\nof 0 eV. This is the energy of the atom when the electron is\ncompletely removed (r = ∞) from the nucleus and is at rest. Observe how\nthe energies of the excited states come closer and closer together as n\nincreases.\n\n12.5  THE LINE SPECTRA OF THE HYDROGEN ATOM\nAccording to the third postulate of Bohr’s model, when an atom makes a\ntransition from the higher energy state with quantum number n\n\ni\n to the\n\nlower energy state with quantum number n\nf\n (n\n\nf\n < n\n\ni\n), the difference of\n\nenergy is carried away by a photon of frequency ν\nif\n such that\n\nFRANCK – HERTZ EXPERIMENT\n\nThe existence of discrete energy levels in an atom was directly verified in 1914 by James\nFranck and Gustav Hertz. They studied the spectrum of mercury vapour when electrons\nhaving different kinetic energies passed through the vapour. The electron energy was\nvaried by subjecting the electrons to electric fields of varying strength. The electrons\ncollide with the mercury atoms and can transfer energy to the mercury atoms. This can\nonly happen when the energy of the electron is higher than the energy difference between\nan energy level of Hg occupied by an electron and a higher unoccupied level (see Figure).\nFor instance, the difference between an occupied energy level of Hg and a higher\nunoccupied level is 4.9 eV. If an electron of having an energy of 4.9 eV or more passes\nthrough mercury, an electron in mercury atom can absorb energy from the bombarding\nelectron and get excited to the higher level [Fig (a)]. The colliding electron’s kinetic energy\nwould reduce by this amount.\n\nThe excited electron would subsequently fall back to the ground state by emission of\nradiation [Fig. (b)]. The wavelength of emitted radiation is:\n\n34 8\n\n19\n\n6.625 10 3 10\n4.9 1.6 10\n\nhc\n\nE\nλ\n\n−\n\n−\n\n× × ×\n= =\n\n× ×\n = 253 nm\n\nBy direct measurement, Franck and Hertz found that the emission spectrum of\nmercury has a line corresponding to this wavelength. For this experimental verification\nof Bohr’s basic ideas of discrete energy levels in atoms and the process of photon emission,\nFrank and Hertz were awarded the Nobel prize in 1925.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n429\n\nAtoms\n\nhν\nif\n =  Eni – Enf (12.20)\n\nUsing Eq.

In this relation, if we take n\n\nf\n = 2 and n\n\ni\n = 3, 4, 5..., it\n\nreduces to a form similar to Eq. (12.10) for the Balmer series. The Rydberg\nconstant R is readily identified to be\n\nR =\n4\n\n2 38\nme\n\nh c0ε\n(12.23)\n\nIf we insert the values of various constants in Eq. (12.23), we get\nR  = 1.03 × 107 m–1\n\nThis is a value very close to the value (1.097 × 107 m–1) obtained from the\nempirical Balmer formula. This agreement between the theoretical and\nexperimental values of the Rydberg constant provided a direct and\nstriking confirmation of the Bohr’s model.\n\nSince both n\nf\n and n\n\ni\n are integers,\n\nthis immediately shows that  in\ntransitions between different atomic\nlevels, light is radiated in various\ndiscrete frequencies. For hydrogen\nspectrum, the Balmer formula\ncorresponds to n\n\nf\n = 2 and n\n\ni\n = 3, 4, 5,\n\netc. The results of the Bohr’s model\nsuggested the presence of other series\nspectra for hydrogen atom–those\ncorresponding to transitions resulting\nfrom n\n\nf\n = 1 and n\n\ni\n = 2, 3, etc.; n\n\nf\n = 3\n\nand n\ni\n = 4, 5, etc., and so on. Such\n\nseries were identified in the course of\nspectroscopic investigations and are\nknown as the Lyman, Balmer,\nPaschen, Brackett, and Pfund series.\nThe electronic transitions\ncorresponding to these series are\nshown in Fig. 12.9.\n\nThe various lines in the atomic\nspectra are produced when electrons\njump from higher energy state to a\nlower energy state and photons are\nemitted. These spectral lines are called\nemission lines. But when an atom\nabsorbs a photon that has precisely\n\nFIGURE 12.9 Line spectra originate in\ntransitions between energy levels.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n430\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n2\n.6\n\nthe same energy needed by the electron in a lower energy state to make\ntransitions to a higher energy state, the process is called absorption.\nThus if photons with a continuous range of frequencies pass through a\nrarefied gas and then are analysed with a spectrometer, a series of dark\nspectral absorption lines appear in the continuous spectrum. The dark\nlines indicate the frequencies that have been absorbed by the atoms of\nthe gas.\n\nThe explanation of the hydrogen atom spectrum provided by Bohr’s\nmodel was a brilliant achievement, which greatly stimulated progress\ntowards the modern quantum theory. In 1922, Bohr was awarded Nobel\nPrize in Physics.\n\nExample 12.6 Using the Rydberg formula, calculate the wavelengths\nof the first four spectral lines in the Lyman series of the hydrogen\nspectrum.\n\nSolution The Rydberg formula is\n\nhc/λ\nif\n  = \n\n4\n\n2 2 2 2\n\n1 1\n8 f i\n\nme\n\nh n n0ε\n\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n−\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\n\uf8ed \uf8f8\n\nThe wavelengths of the first four lines in the Lyman series correspond\nto transitions from n\n\ni\n = 2,3,4,5 to n\n\nf\n = 1.

It states that the angular\nmomentum of the electron orbiting around the nucleus is quantised (that\nis, L\n\nn\n = nh/2π; n  = 1, 2, 3 …). Why should the angular momentum have\n\nonly those values that are integral multiples of h/2π? The French physicist\nLouis de Broglie explained this puzzle in 1923, ten years after Bohr\nproposed his model.\n\nWe studied, in Chapter 11, about the de Broglie’s hypothesis that\nmaterial particles, such as electrons, also have a wave nature. C. J. Davisson\nand L. H. Germer later experimentally verified the wave nature of electrons\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n431\n\nAtoms\n\nin 1927. Louis de Broglie argued that the electron in its\ncircular orbit, as proposed by Bohr, must be seen as a particle\nwave. In analogy to waves travelling on a string, particle waves\ntoo can lead to standing waves under resonant conditions.\nFrom Chapter 15 of Class XI Physics  textbook, we know that\nwhen a string is plucked, a vast number of wavelengths are\nexcited. However only those wavelengths survive which have\nnodes at the ends and form the standing wave in the string. It\nmeans that in a string, standing waves are formed when the\ntotal distance travelled by a wave down the string and back is\none wavelength, two wavelengths, or any integral number of\nwavelengths. Waves with other wavelengths interfere with\nthemselves upon reflection and their amplitudes quickly drop\nto zero. For an electron moving in nth circular orbit of radius\nr\n\nn\n, the total distance is the circumference of the orbit, 2πr\n\nn\n.\n\nThus\n\n2π r\nn\n = nλ,      n = 1, 2, 3... (12.24)\n\nFigure 12.10 illustrates a standing particle wave on a\ncircular orbit for n = 4, i.e., 2πr\n\nn\n = 4λ, where λ is the de Broglie\n\nwavelength of the electron moving in nth orbit. From Chapter\n11, we have λ = h/p, where p is the magnitude of the electron’s\nmomentum. If the speed of the electron is much less than the speed of\nlight, the momentum is mv\n\nn\n. Thus, λ = h/mv\n\nn\n. From Eq. (12.24), we have\n\n2π r\nn\n =  n h/mv\n\nn\n      or     m v\n\nn \nr\n\nn  \n=  nh/2π\n\nThis is the quantum condition proposed by Bohr for the angular\nmomentum of the electron [Eq. (12.13)]. In Section 12.5, we saw that\nthis equation is the basis of explaining the discrete orbits and energy\nlevels in hydrogen atom. Thus de Broglie hypothesis provided an\nexplanation for Bohr’s second postulate for the quantisation of angular\nmomentum of the orbiting electron. The quantised electron orbits and\nenergy states are due to the wave nature of the electron and only resonant\nstanding waves can persist.\n\nBohr’s model, involving classical trajectory picture (planet-like electron\norbiting the nucleus), correctly predicts the gross features of the\nhydrogenic atoms*, in particular, the frequencies of the radiation emitted\nor selectively absorbed. This model however has many limitations.\nSome are:\n(i) The Bohr model is applicable to hydrogenic atoms. It cannot be\n\nextended even to mere two electron atoms such as helium. The analysis\nof atoms with more than one electron was attempted on the lines of\nBohr’s model for hydrogenic atoms but did not meet with any success.\nDifficulty lies in the fact that each electron interacts not only with the\npositively charged nucleus but also with all other electrons.\n\nFIGURE 12.10 A standing\nwave is shown on a circular\norbit where four de Broglie\n\nwavelengths fit into the\ncircumference of the orbit.\n\n* Hydrogenic atoms are the atoms consisting of a nucleus with positive charge\n+Ze and a single electron, where Z is the proton number. Examples are hydrogen\natom, singly ionised helium, doubly ionised lithium, and so forth. In these\natoms more complex electron-electron interactions are nonexistent.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n432\n\nThe formulation of Bohr model involves electrical force between\npositively charged nucleus and electron. It does not include the\nelectrical forces between electrons which necessarily appear in\nmulti-electron atoms.\n\n(ii) While the Bohr’s model correctly predicts the frequencies of the light\nemitted by hydrogenic atoms, the model is unable to explain the\nrelative intensities of the frequencies in the spectrum. In emission\nspectrum of hydrogen, some of the visible frequencies have weak\nintensity, others strong. Why? Experimental observations depict that\nsome transitions are more favoured than others. Bohr’s model is\nunable to account for the intensity variations.\n\nBohr’s model presents an elegant picture of an atom and cannot be\ngeneralised to complex atoms. For complex atoms we have to use a new\nand radical theory based on Quantum Mechanics, which provides a more\ncomplete picture of the atomic structure.\n\nLASER LIGHT\n\nImagine a crowded market place or a railway platform with people entering a gate and\ngoing towards all directions. Their footsteps are random and there is no phase correlation\nbetween them. On the other hand, think of a large number of soldiers in a regulated march.\nTheir footsteps are very well correlated. See figure here.\n\nThis is similar to the difference between light emitted by\nan ordinary source like a candle or a bulb and that emitted\nby a laser. The acronym LASER stands for Light Amplification\nby Stimulated Emission of Radiation. Since its development\nin 1960, it has entered into all areas of science and technology.\nIt has found applications in physics, chemistry, biology,\nmedicine, surgery, engineering, etc. There are low power\nlasers, with a power of 0.5 mW, called pencil lasers, which\nserve as pointers. There are also lasers of different power,\nsuitable for delicate surgery of eye or glands in the stomach.\nFinally, there are lasers which can cut or weld steel.\n\nLight is emitted from a source in the form of packets of\nwaves. Light coming out from an ordinary source contains a mixture of many wavelengths.\nThere is also no phase relation between the various waves. Therefore, such light, even if it is\npassed through an aperture, spreads very fast and the beam size increases rapidly with\ndistance. In the case of laser light, the wavelength of each packet is almost the same. Also\nthe average length of the packet of waves is much larger. This means that there is better\nphase correlation over a longer duration of time. This results in reducing the divergence of\na laser beam substantially.\n\nIf there are N atoms in a source, each emitting light with intensity I, then the total\nintensity produced by an ordinary source is proportional to NI, whereas in a laser source,\nit is proportional to N2I. Considering that N is very large, we see that the light from a laser\ncan be much stronger than that from an ordinary source.\n\nWhen astronauts of the Apollo missions visited the moon, they placed a mirror on its\nsurface, facing the earth. Then scientists on the earth sent a strong laser beam, which was\nreflected by the mirror on the moon and received back on the earth. The size of the reflected\nlaser beam and the time taken for the round trip were measured. This allowed a very\naccurate determination of (a) the extremely small divergence of a laser beam and (b) the\ndistance of the moon from the earth.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n433\n\nAtoms\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. Atom, as a whole, is electrically neutral and therefore contains equal\namount of positive and negative charges.\n\n2. In Thomson’s model, an atom is a spherical cloud of positive charges\nwith electrons embedded in it.\n\n3. In Rutherford’s model, most of the mass of the atom and all its positive\ncharge are concentrated in a tiny nucleus (typically one by ten thousand\nthe size of an atom), and the electrons revolve around it.\n\n4. Rutherford nuclear model has two main difficulties in explaining the\nstructure of atom: (a) It predicts that atoms are unstable because the\naccelerated electrons revolving around the nucleus must spiral into\nthe nucleus. This contradicts the stability of matter. (b) It cannot\nexplain the characteristic line spectra of atoms of different elements.\n\n5. Atoms of most of the elements are stable and emit characteristic\nspectrum. The spectrum consists of a set of isolated parallel lines\ntermed as line spectrum. It provides useful information about the\natomic structure.\n\n6. The atomic hydrogen emits a line spectrum consisting of various series.\nThe frequency of any line in a series can be expressed as a difference\nof two terms;\n\nLyman series: ν = −\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\nRc\n\nn\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n2 2\n\n; n = 2, 3, 4,...\n\nBalmer series: ν = −\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f7Rc\n\nn\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n2 2\n\n; n = 3, 4, 5,...\n\nPaschen series: ν = −\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\nRc\n\nn\n\n1\n\n3\n\n1\n2 2\n\n; n = 4, 5, 6,...\n\nBrackett series: ν = −\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\nRc\n\nn\n\n1\n\n4\n\n1\n2 2\n\n; n = 5, 6, 7,...\n\nPfund series: ν = −\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f7Rc\n\nn\n\n1\n\n5\n\n1\n2 2\n\n; n = 6, 7, 8,...\n\n7. To explain the line spectra emitted by atoms, as well as the stability\nof atoms, Niel’s Bohr proposed a model for hydrogenic (single elctron)\natoms. He introduced three postulates and laid the foundations of\nquantum mechanics:\n(a) In a hydrogen atom, an electron revolves in certain stable orbits\n\n(called stationary orbits) without the emission of radiant energy.\n(b) The stationary orbits are those for which the angular momentum\n\nis some integral multiple of h/2π. (Bohr’s quantisation condition.)\nThat is L = nh/2π, where n is an integer called the principal\nquantum number.\n\n(c) The third postulate states that an electron might make a transition\nfrom one of its specified non-radiating orbits to another of lower\nenergy. When it does so, a photon is emitted having energy equal\nto the energy difference between the initial and final states. The\nfrequency (ν) of the emitted photon is then given by\nhν  = E\n\ni\n – E\n\nf\n\nAn atom absorbs radiation of the same frequency the atom emits,\nin which case the electron is transferred to an orbit with a higher\nvalue of n.\n\nE\ni\n + hν  =  E\n\nf\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n434\n\n8. As a result of the quantisation condition of angular momentum, the\nelectron orbits the nucleus at only specific radii. For a hydrogen atom\nit is given by\n\n22\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n2n\n\nn h\nr\n\nm e\n\nε\uf8eb \uf8f6 π\uf8eb \uf8f6\n= \uf8ec \uf8f7\uf8ec \uf8f7 \uf8ed \uf8f8π\uf8ed \uf8f8\n\nThe total energy is also quantised:\n\n4\n\n2 2 2\n08\n\nn\n\nme\nE\n\nn hε\n= −\n\n     = –13.6 eV/n2\n\nThe n = 1 state is called ground state. In hydrogen atom the ground\nstate energy is  –13.6 eV. Higher values of n correspond to excited\nstates (n > 1). Atoms are excited to these higher states by collisions\nwith other atoms or electrons or by absorption of a photon of right\nfrequency.\n\n9. de Broglie’s hypothesis that electrons have a wavelength λ = h/mv gave\nan explanation for Bohr’s quantised orbits by bringing in the wave-\nparticle duality. The orbits correspond to circular standing waves in\nwhich the circumference of the orbit equals a whole number of\nwavelengths.\n\n10. Bohr’s model is applicable only to hydrogenic (single electron) atoms.\nIt cannot be extended to even two electron atoms such as helium.\nThis model is also unable to explain for the relative intensities of the\nfrequencies emitted even by hydrogenic atoms.\n\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n\n1. Both the Thomson’s as well as the Rutherford’s models constitute an\nunstable system. Thomson’s model is unstable electrostatically, while\nRutherford’s model is unstable because of electromagnetic radiation\nof orbiting electrons.\n\n2. What made Bohr quantise angular momentum (second postulate) and\nnot some other quantity? Note, h has dimensions of angular\nmomentum, and for circular orbits, angular momentum is a very\nrelevant quantity. The second postulate is then so natural!\n\n3. The orbital picture in Bohr’s model of the hydrogen atom was\ninconsistent with the uncertainty principle. It was replaced by modern\nquantum mechanics in which Bohr’s orbits are regions where the\nelectron may be found with large probability.\n\n4. Unlike the situation in the solar system, where planet-planet\ngravitational forces are very small as compared to the gravitational\nforce of the sun on each planet (because the mass of the sun is so\nmuch greater than the mass of any of the planets), the electron-electron\nelectric force interaction is comparable in magnitude to the electron-\nnucleus electrical force, because the charges and distances are of the\nsame order of magnitude. This is the reason why the Bohr’s model\nwith its planet-like electron is not applicable to many electron atoms.\n\n5. Bohr laid the foundation of the quantum theory by postulating specific\norbits in which electrons do not radiate. Bohr’s model include only\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n435\n\nAtoms\n\none quantum number n. The new theory called quantum mechanics\nsupportes Bohr’s postulate. However in quantum mechanics (more\ngenerally accepted), a given energy level may not correspond to just\none quantum state. For example, a state is characterised by four\nquantum numbers (n, l, m, and s), but for a pure Coulomb potential\n(as in hydrogen atom) the energy depends only on n.\n\n6. In Bohr model, contrary to ordinary classical expectation, the\nfrequency of revolution of an electron in its orbit is not connected to\nthe frequency of spectral line. The later is the difference between two\norbital energies divided by h. For transitions between large quantum\nnumbers (n to n – 1, n very large), however, the two coincide as expected.\n\n7. Bohr’s semiclassical model based on some aspects of classical physics\nand some aspects of modern physics also does not provide a true\npicture of the simplest hydrogenic atoms. The true picture is quantum\nmechanical affair which differs from Bohr model in a number of\nfundamental ways. But then if the Bohr model is not strictly correct,\nwhy do we bother about it? The reasons which make Bohr’s model\nstill useful are:\n\n(i) The model is based on just three postulates but accounts for almost\nall the general features of the hydrogen spectrum.\n\n(ii) The model incorporates many of the concepts we have learnt in\nclassical physics.\n\n(iii) The model demonstrates how a theoretical physicist occasionally\nmust quite literally ignore certain problems of approach in hopes\nof being able to make some predictions. If the predictions of the\ntheory or model agree with experiment, a theoretician then must\nsomehow hope to explain away or rationalise the problems that\nwere ignored along the way.\n\nEXERCISES\n\n12.1 Choose the correct alternative from the clues given at the end of\nthe each statement:\n\n(a) The size of the atom in Thomson’s model is .......... the atomic\nsize in Rutherford’s model.

Then what determines the typical atomic size? Why is an\natom not, say, thousand times bigger than its typical size? The\nquestion had greatly puzzled Bohr before he arrived at his famous\nmodel of the atom that you have learnt in the text. To simulate what\nhe might well have done before his discovery, let us play as follows\nwith the basic constants of nature and see if we can get a quantity\nwith the dimensions of length that is roughly equal to the known\nsize of an atom (~ 10–10m).\n\n(a) Construct a quantity with the dimensions of length from the\nfundamental constants e, m\n\ne\n, and c. Determine its numerical\n\nvalue.\n\n(b) You will find that the length obtained in (a) is many orders of\nmagnitude smaller than the atomic dimensions. Further, it\ninvolves c. But energies of atoms are mostly in non-relativistic\ndomain where c is not expected to play any role. This is what\nmay have suggested Bohr to discard c and look for ‘something\nelse’ to get the right atomic size. Now, the Planck’s constant h\nhad already made its appearance elsewhere. Bohr’s great insight\nlay in recognising that h, m\n\ne\n, and e will yield the right atomic\n\nsize. Construct a quantity with the dimension of length from h,\nme, and e and confirm that its numerical value has indeed the\ncorrect order of magnitude.\n\n12.15 The total energy of an electron in the first excited state of the\nhydrogen atom is about –3.4 eV.\n\n(a) What is the kinetic energy of the electron in this state?\n\n(b) What is the potential energy of the electron in this state?\n\n(c) Which of the answers above would change if the choice of the\nzero of potential energy is changed?\n\n12.16 If Bohr’s quantisation postulate (angular momentum = nh/2π) is a\nbasic law of nature, it should be equally valid for the case of planetary\nmotion also. Why then do we never speak of quantisation of orbits\nof planets around the sun?\n\n12.17 Obtain the first Bohr’s radius and the ground state energy of a\nmuonic hydrogen atom [i.e., an atom in which a negatively charged\nmuon (µ–) of mass about 207m\n\ne\n orbits around a proton].\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n\n')('status', 200)
