These currents do not change direction with time. But voltages\nand currents that vary with time are very common. The electric mains\nsupply in our homes and offices is a voltage that varies like a sine function\nwith time. Such a voltage is called alternating voltage (ac voltage) and\nthe current driven by it in a circuit is called the alternating current (ac\ncurrent)*. Today, most of the electrical devices we use require ac voltage.\nThis is mainly because most of the electrical energy sold by power\ncompanies is transmitted and distributed as alternating current. The main\nreason for preferring use of ac voltage over dc voltage is that ac voltages\ncan be easily and efficiently converted from one voltage to the other by\nmeans of transformers. Further, electrical energy can also be transmitted\neconomically over long distances. AC circuits exhibit characteristics which\nare exploited in many devices of daily use. For example, whenever we\ntune our radio to a favourite station, we are taking advantage of a special\nproperty of ac circuits – one of many that you will study in this chapter.\n\nChapter Seven\n\nALTERNATING\n\nCURRENT\n\n* The phrases ac voltage and ac current are contradictory and redundant,\nrespectively, since they mean, literally, alternating current voltage and alternating\n\ncurrent current. Still, the abbreviation ac to designate an electrical quantity\n\ndisplaying simple harmonic time dependance has become so universally accepted\n\nthat we follow others in its use. Further, voltage – another phrase commonly\n\nused means potential difference between two points.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n234\n\nN\nIC\n\nO\nL\nA\n\n T\nE\n\nS\nL\nA\n\n (\n1\n8\n5\n6\n –\n\n 1\n9\n\n4\n3\n\n)\n\nNicola Tesla  (1856 –\n1943) Serbian-American\nscientist, inventor and\n\ngenius. He conceived the\nidea of the rotating\nmagnetic field, which is the\n\nbasis of practically all\nalternating current\nmachinery, and which\n\nhelped usher in the age of\nelectric power. He also\ninvented among other\n\nthings the induction motor,\nthe polyphase system of ac\npower, and the high\n\nfrequency induction coil\n(the Tesla coil) used in radio\nand television sets and\n\nother electronic equipment.\nThe SI unit of magnetic field\nis named in his honour.\n\n7.2  AC VOLTAGE APPLIED TO A RESISTOR\nFigure 7.1 shows a resistor connected to a source ε of\nac voltage. The symbol for an ac source in a circuit\n\ndiagram is . We consider a source which produces\nsinusoidally varying potential difference across its\nterminals. Let this potential difference, also called ac\n\nvoltage, be given by\n\nsinmv v tω= (7.1)\nwhere v\n\nm\n is the amplitude of the oscillating potential\n\ndifference and ω  is its angular frequency.\n\nTo find the value of current through the resistor, we\n\napply Kirchhoff’s loop rule ε( )t =∑ 0 (refer to Section\n3.13), to the circuit shown in Fig. 7.1 to get\n\n=sinmv t i Rω\n\nor   sin\nmvi t\nR\n\nω=\n\nSince R is a constant, we can write this equation as\n\nsinmi i tω= (7.2)\nwhere the current amplitude i\n\nm\n is given by\n\nm\nm\n\nv\ni\n\nR\n= (7.3)\n\nEquation (7.3) is Ohm’s law, which for resistors, works equally\n\nwell for both ac and dc voltages. The voltage across a pure resistor\n\nand the current through it, given by Eqs. (7.1) and (7.2) are\n\nplotted as a function of time in Fig. 7.2. Note, in particular that\n\nboth v and i reach zero, minimum and maximum values at the\n\nsame time. Clearly, the voltage and current are in phase with\n\neach other.\n\nWe see that, like the applied voltage, the current varies\n\nsinusoidally and has corresponding positive and negative values\n\nduring each cycle. Thus, the sum of the instantaneous current\n\nvalues over one complete cycle is zero, and the average current\n\nis zero. The fact that the average current is zero, however, does\n\nFIGURE 7.1  AC voltage applied to a resistor.\n\nFIGURE 7.2 In a pure\nresistor, the voltage and\n\ncurrent are in phase.

Thus,\nhe came into conflict\n\nwith Thomas Alva Edison,\nan advocate of direct\ncurrent. Westinghouse\n\nwas convinced that the\ntechnology of alternating\ncurrent was the key to\n\nthe electrical future.\nHe founded the famous\nCompany named after him\n\nand enlisted the services\nof Nicola Tesla and\nother inventors in the\n\ndevelopment of alternating\ncurrent motors and\napparatus for the\n\ntransmission of high\ntension current, pioneering\nin large scale lighting.\n\nnot mean that the average power consumed is zero and\nthat there is no dissipation of electrical energy. As you\n\nknow, Joule heating is given by i2R and depends on i2\n\n(which is always positive whether i is positive or negative)\nand not on i. Thus, there is Joule heating and\n\ndissipation of electrical energy when an\nac current passes through a resistor.\nThe instantaneous power dissipated in the resistor is\n\n2 2 2\nsinmp i R i R tω= = (7.4)\n\nThe average value of p over a cycle is*\n\n2 2 2\nsinmp i R i R tω= < > = < >   [7.5(a)]\n\nwhere the bar over a letter (here, p) denotes its average\nvalue and <......> denotes taking average of the quantity\n\ninside the bracket. Since,  i2\nm \n\nand R are constants,\n\n2 2\nsinmp i R tω= < > [7.5(b)]\n\nUsing the trigonometric identity, sin2 ωt =\n1/2 (1– cos 2ωt ), we have < sin2 ωt > = (1/2) (1– < cos 2ωt >)\nand since < cos2ωt > = 0**, we have,\n\n2 1sin\n2\n\ntω< > =\n\nThus,\n\n21\n\n2\nmp i R= [7.5(c)]\n\nTo express ac power in the same form as dc power\n(P = I2R), a special value of current is defined and used.\nIt is called, root mean square (rms) or effective current\n\n(Fig. 7.3) and is denoted by I\nrms\n\n or I.\n\n* The average value of a function F (t ) over a period T is given by F t\nT\n\nF t t\n\nT\n\n( ) ( )= ∫\n1\n\n0\n\nd\n\n** < > = ∫ =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\uf8ef\n\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb\uf8fa\n\n= −[ ] =cos cos sin sin2 1 2 1 2\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n2 0 0\n\n0 0\n\nω ω\nω\n\nω ω\nωt\n\nT\nt dt\n\nT\n\nt\n\nT\nT\n\nTT\n\nFIGURE 7.3 The rms current I is related to the\n\npeak  current i\nm\n by I = / 2\n\nm\ni  = 0.707 i\n\nm\n.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n236\n\nIt is defined by\n\n2 21\n\n2 2\n\nm\nm\n\ni\nI i i= = =\n\n= 0.707 i\nm\n\n(7.6)\n\nIn terms of I, the average power, denoted by P is\n\n2 21\n\n2\nm\n\npP i R I R= = = (7.7)\n\nSimilarly, we define the rms voltage or effective voltage by\n\nV = \n2\n\nmv\n = 0.707 v\n\nm\n(7.8)\n\nFrom Eq.

This shows the advantage of\n\nintroducing the concept of rms values. In terms of rms values, the equation\nfor power [Eq. (7.7)] and relation between current and voltage in ac circuits\nare essentially the same as those for the dc case.\n\nIt is customary to measure and specify rms values for ac quantities. For\nexample, the household line voltage of 220 V is an rms value with a peak\nvoltage of\n\nv\nm\n = 2  V =  (1.414)(220 V) = 311 V\n\nIn fact, the I or rms current is the equivalent dc current that would\nproduce the same average power loss as the alternating current. Equation\n\n(7.7) can also be written as\nP = V2 / R = I V    (since V = I R )\n\nExample 7.1 A light  bulb is rated at 100W for a 220 V supply.

But this is not so in the case  of an inductor,\na capacitor or a combination  of these circuit elements. In order to show\n\nphase relationship between voltage and current\nin an ac circuit, we use the notion of phasors.\nThe analysis of an ac circuit is facilitated by the\n\nuse of a phasor diagram. A phasor* is a vector\nwhich rotates about the origin with angular\nspeed ω, as shown in Fig. 7.4. The vertical\ncomponents of phasors V and I represent the\nsinusoidally varying quantities v and i. The\nmagnitudes of phasors V and I represent  the\n\namplitudes or the peak values v\nm\n and i\n\nm\n of these\n\noscillating quantities. Figure 7.4(a) shows the\nvoltage and current phasors and their\n\nrelationship at time t\n1\n for the case of an ac source\n\nconnected to a resistor i.e., corresponding to the\ncircuit shown in Fig. 7.1. The projection of\n\nvoltage and current phasors on vertical axis, i.e., v\nm\n sinω t and i\n\nm\n sinω t,\n\nrespectively represent the value of voltage and current at that instant. As\nthey rotate with frequency ω, curves in Fig. 7.4(b) are generated.\nFrom Fig. 7.4(a) we see that phasors V and I for the case of a resistor are\nin the same direction. This is so for all times. This means that the phase\nangle between the voltage and the current is zero.\n\n7.4  AC VOLTAGE APPLIED TO AN INDUCTOR\nFigure 7.5 shows an ac source connected to an inductor. Usually,\ninductors have appreciable resistance in their windings, but we shall\n\nassume that this inductor has negligible resistance.\nThus, the circuit is a purely inductive ac circuit. Let\nthe voltage across the source be v = v\n\nm\n sinω t. Using\n\nthe Kirchhoff’s loop rule, ε ( )t =∑ 0 , and  since there\nis no resistor in the circuit,\n\nd\n0\n\nd\n\ni\nv L\n\nt\n− = (7.10)\n\nwhere the second term is the self-induced Faraday\nemf in the inductor; and L is the self-inductance of\n\nFIGURE 7.4 (a) A phasor diagram for the\ncircuit in Fig 7.1. (b) Graph of v and\n\ni versus ωt.\n\nFIGURE 7.5  An ac source\nconnected to an inductor.\n\n* Though voltage and current in ac circuit are represented by phasors – rotating\nvectors, they are not vectors themselves. They are scalar quantities. It so happens\n\nthat the amplitudes and phases of harmonically varying scalars combine\n\nmathematically in the same way as do the projections of rotating vectors of\n\ncorresponding magnitudes and directions. The rotating vectors that represent\n\nharmonically varying scalar quantities are introduced only to provide us with a\nsimple way of adding these quantities using a rule that we already know.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n238\n\nthe inductor. The negative sign follows from Lenz’s law (Chapter 6).\nCombining Eqs. (7.1) and (7.10), we have\n\nd\nsin\n\nd\nmvi v t\n\nt L L\nω= = (7.11)\n\nEquation (7.11) implies that the equation for i(t), the current as a\nfunction of time, must be such that its slope di/dt is a sinusoidally varying\n\nquantity, with the same phase as the source voltage and an amplitude\ngiven by v\n\nm\n/L. To obtain the current, we integrate di/dt with respect to\n\ntime:\n\nd\n\nd\nd d\n\ni\n\nt\nt\n\nv\n\nL\nt tm∫ ∫= sin( )ω\n\nand get,\n\ncos( ) constantm\nv\n\ni t\nL\n\n= − ω +\nω\n\nThe integration constant has the dimension of current and is time-\nindependent. Since the source has an emf which oscillates symmetrically\nabout zero, the current it sustains also oscillates symmetrically about\n\nzero, so that no constant or time-independent component of the current\nexists. Therefore, the integration constant is zero.\n\nUsing\n\n− = −\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\ncos( ) sinω ωt t\nπ\n2\n\n, we have\n\ni i tm= −\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\nsin ω\nπ\n2\n\n(7.12)\n\nwhere  \nm\n\nm\n\nv\ni\n\nL\n=\n\nω\nis the amplitude of the current. The quantity ω L is\n\nanalogous to the resistance and is called inductive reactance, denoted\nby X\n\nL\n:\n\nX\nL\n = ω L (7.13)\n\nThe amplitude of the current is, then\n\nm\nm\n\nL\n\nv\ni\n\nX\n= (7.14)\n\nThe dimension of inductive reactance is the same as that of resistance\nand its SI unit is ohm (Ω). The inductive reactance limits the current in a\npurely inductive circuit in the same way as the resistance limits the\ncurrent in a purely resistive circuit. The inductive reactance is directly\nproportional to the inductance and to the frequency of the current.\n\nA comparison of Eqs. (7.1) and (7.12) for the source voltage and the\ncurrent in an inductor shows that the current lags the voltage by π/2 or\none-quarter (1/4) cycle. Figure 7.6 (a) shows the voltage and the current\nphasors in the present case at instant t\n\n1\n. The current phasor I is π/2\n\nbehind the voltage phasor V. When rotated with frequency ω counter-\nclockwise, they generate the voltage and current given by Eqs. (7.1) and\n(7.12), respectively and as shown in Fig. 7.6(b).\n\nIn\nte\n\nra\nc\nti\n\nv\ne\n a\n\nn\nim\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n o\nn\n\n P\nh\n\na\ns\no\n\nr \nd\n\nia\ng\n\nra\nm\n\ns\n o\n\nf \na\nc\n c\n\nir\nc\nu\n\nit\ns\n c\n\no\nn\n\nta\nin\n\nin\ng\n\n, \nR\n\n, \nL\n, \n\nC\n a\n\nn\nd\n\n R\nL\nC\n\n s\ne\nri\n\ne\ns\n c\n\nir\nc\nu\n\nit\ns\n:\n\nh\ntt\np\n:/\n/w\n\nw\nw\n\n.a\nn\nim\n\na\nti\no\nn\ns.\n\np\nh\ny\nsi\n\nc\ns.\n\nu\nn\nsw\n\n.e\nd\nu\n.a\n\nu\n//\njw\n\n/A\nC\n\n.h\ntm\n\nl\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n239\n\nAlternating Current\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 7\n\n.2\n\nWe see that the current reaches its maximum value later than the\n\nvoltage by one-fourth of a period \nT\n\n4\n\n2\n=\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f0\uf8ef\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb\uf8fa\n\nπ/\nω\n\n.

(b) Graph of v and i versus ωt.\n\nThe dimension of capacitive reactance is the\nsame as that of resistance and its SI unit is\n\nohm (Ω). The capacitive reactance limits the\namplitude of the current in a purely capacitive\ncircuit in the same way as the resistance limits\n\nthe current in a purely resistive circuit. But it\nis inversely proportional to the frequency and\nthe capacitance.\n\nA comparison of Eq. (7.16) with the\nequation of source voltage, Eq. (7.1) shows that\nthe current is π/2 ahead of voltage.\n\nFigure 7.9(a) shows the phasor diagram at an instant t\n1\n. Here the current\n\nphasor I is π/2 ahead of the voltage phasor V as they rotate\ncounterclockwise. Figure 7.9(b) shows the variation of voltage and current\n\nwith time. We see that the current reaches its maximum value earlier than\nthe voltage by one-fourth of a period.\n\nThe instantaneous power supplied to the capacitor is\n\np\nc\n = i v = i\n\nm\n cos(ωt)v\n\nm\n sin(ωt)\n\n    = i\nm\nv\n\nm\n cos(ωt) sin(ωt)\n\n    sin(2 )\n2\n\nm mi v tω= (7.19)\n\nSo, as in the case of an inductor, the average power\n\nsin(2 ) sin(2 ) 0\n2 2\n\nm m m m\nC\n\ni v i v\nP t tω ω= = =\n\nsince <sin (2ωt)> = 0 over a complete cycle. Figure 7.10 explains it in detail.\nThus, we see that in the case of an inductor, the current lags the voltage\nby π/2 and in the case of a capacitor, the current leads the voltage by π/2.\n\nExample 7.3 A lamp is connected in series with a capacitor. Predict\n\nyour observations for dc and ac connections. What happens in each\ncase if the capacitance of the capacitor is reduced?\n\nSolution When a dc source is connected to a capacitor, the capacitor\n\ngets charged and after charging no current flows in the circuit and\nthe lamp will not glow. There will be no change even if C is reduced.\nWith ac source, the capacitor offers capacitative reactance (1/ωC )\nand the current flows in the circuit. Consequently, the lamp will shine.\nReducing C will increase reactance and the lamp will shine less brightly\nthan before.\n\nExample 7.4 A 15.0 µF capacitor is connected to a 220 V, 50 Hz source.\nFind the capacitive reactance and the current (rms and peak) in the\ncircuit.

The glow of the light bulb (a) increases; (b)\n\ndecreases; (c) is unchanged, as the iron rod is inserted. Give your\n\nanswer with reasons.\n\nSolution  As the iron rod is inserted, the magnetic field inside the coil\n\nmagnetizes the iron increasing the magnetic field inside it. Hence,\n\nthe inductance of the coil increases. Consequently, the inductive\n\nreactance of the coil increases. As a result, a larger fraction of the\n\napplied ac voltage appears across the inductor, leaving less voltage\n\nacross the bulb. Therefore, the glow of the light bulb decreases.\n\n7.6  AC VOLTAGE APPLIED TO A SERIES  LCR CIRCUIT\nFigure 7.12 shows a series LCR circuit connected to an ac source ε. As\nusual, we take the voltage of the source to be v = v\n\nm \nsin ωt.\n\nIf q is the charge on the capacitor and i the\ncurrent, at time t, we have, from Kirchhoff’s loop\nrule:\n\nd\n\nd\n\ni q\nL i R v\n\nt C\n+ + = (7.20)\n\nWe want to determine the instantaneous\ncurrent i and its phase relationship to the applied\n\nalternating voltage v. We shall solve this problem\nby two methods. First, we use the technique of\nphasors and in the second method, we solve\n\nEq. (7.20) analytically to obtain the time–\ndependence of i .\n\nFIGURE 7.12 A series LCR circuit\nconnected to an ac source.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n245\n\nAlternating Current\n\n7.6.1  Phasor-diagram solution\n\nFrom the circuit shown in Fig. 7.12, we see that the resistor, inductor\nand capacitor are in series. Therefore, the ac current in each element is\nthe same at any time, having the same amplitude and phase. Let it be\n\ni = i\nm\n sin(ωt+φ ) (7.21)\n\nwhere φ is the phase difference between the voltage across the source and\nthe current in the circuit. On the basis of what we have learnt in the previous\n\nsections, we shall construct a phasor diagram for the present case.\nLet I be the phasor representing the current in the circuit as given by\n\nEq. (7.21). Further, let V\nL\n, V\n\nR\n, V\n\nC\n, and V represent the voltage across the\n\ninductor, resistor, capacitor and the source, respectively. From previous\nsection, we know that V\n\nR\n is parallel to I, V\n\nC\n is π/2\n\nbehind I and V\nL\n is  π/2 ahead of I. V\n\nL\n, V\n\nR\n, V\n\nC\n and I\n\nare shown in Fig. 7.13(a) with apppropriate phase-\nrelations.\n\nThe length of these phasors or the amplitude\n\nof V\nR\n, V\n\nC\n and V\n\nL\n are:\n\nv\nRm\n\n = i\nm\n\n R, v\nCm\n\n = i\nm\n\n X\nC\n,\n \nv\n\nLm \n=\n\n \ni\nm \n\nX\nL\n\n(7.22)\n\nThe voltage Equation (7.20) for the circuit can\n\nbe written as\n\nv\nL\n + v\n\nR\n + v\n\nC\n = v (7.23)\n\nThe phasor relation whose vertical component\n\ngives the above equation is\n\nV\nL\n + V\n\nR\n + V\n\nC\n = V (7.24)\n\nThis relation is represented in Fig. 7.13(b). Since\n\nV\nC\n  and V\n\nL\n are always along the same line and in\n\nopposite directions, they can be combined into a single phasor (V\nC\n + V\n\nL\n)\n\nwhich has a magnitude \uf8e6v\nCm\n\n – v\nLm\n\n\uf8e6. Since V is represented as the\nhypotenuse of a right-triangle whose sides are V\n\nR\n and (V\n\nC\n + V\n\nL\n), the\n\npythagorean theorem gives:\n\n( )22 2m Rm Cm Lmv v v v= + −\nSubstituting the values of v\n\nRm\n, v\n\nCm\n, and v\n\nLm\n from Eq. (7.22) into the above\n\nequation, we have\n\n2 2 2\n( ) ( )m m m C m Lv i R i X i X= + −\n\n     = + −\uf8ee\uf8f0 \uf8f9\uf8fbi R X Xm C L\n2 2 2\n\n( )\n\nor,  \n2 2\n\n( )\n\nm\nm\n\nC L\n\nv\ni\n\nR X X\n=\n\n+ −\n[7.25(a)]\n\nBy analogy to the resistance in a circuit, we introduce the impedance Z\n\nin an ac circuit:\n\nm\nm\n\nv\ni\n\nZ\n= [7.25(b)]\n\nwhere 2 2( )C LZ R X X= + − (7.26)\n\nFIGURE 7.13 (a) Relation between the\nphasors V\n\nL\n, V\n\nR\n, V\n\nC\n, and I, (b) Relation\n\nbetween the  phasors V\nL\n, V\n\nR\n, and (V\n\nL\n + V\n\nC\n)\n\nfor the circuit in Fig. 7.12.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n246\n\nSince phasor I is always parallel to phasor V\nR\n, the phase angle φ\n\nis the angle between V\nR\n and V and can be determined from\n\nFig. 7.14:\n\ntan Cm Lm\n\nRm\n\nv v\n\nv\nφ\n\n−\n=\n\nUsing Eq. (7.22), we have\n\ntan C L\nX X\n\nR\nφ\n\n−\n= (7.27)\n\nEquations (7.26) and (7.27) are graphically shown in Fig. (7.14).\n\nThis is called Impedance diagram which is a right-triangle with\nZ as its hypotenuse.\n\nEquation 7.25(a) gives the amplitude of the current and Eq. (7.27)\n\ngives the phase angle. With these, Eq. (7.21) is completely specified.\nIf X\n\nC\n > X\n\nL\n, φ is positive and the circuit is predominantly capacitive.\n\nConsequently, the current in the circuit leads the source voltage. If\n\nX\nC\n < X\n\nL\n, φ is negative and the circuit is predominantly inductive.\n\nConsequently, the current in the circuit lags  the source voltage.\nFigure 7.15 shows the phasor diagram and variation of v and i with ω t\n\nfor the case X\nC\n > X\n\nL\n.\n\nThus, we have obtained the amplitude\nand phase of current for an LCR series circuit\n\nusing the technique of phasors. But this\nmethod of analysing ac circuits suffers from\ncertain disadvantages. First, the phasor\n\ndiagram say nothing about the initial\ncondition. One can take any arbitrary value\nof t (say, t\n\n1\n, as done throughout this chapter)\n\nand draw different phasors which show the\nrelative angle between different phasors.\nThe solution so obtained is called the\n\nsteady-state solution. This is not a general\nsolution. Additionally, we do have a\ntransient solution which exists even for\n\nv = 0. The general solution is the sum of the\ntransient solution and the steady-state\n\nsolution. After a sufficiently long time, the effects of the transient solution\n\ndie out and the behaviour of the circuit is described by the steady-state\nsolution.\n\n7.6.2  Analytical solution\n\nThe voltage equation for the circuit is\n\nd\n\nd\n\ni q\nL R i v\n\nt C\n+ + =\n\n                 = v\nm\n sin ωt\n\nWe know that i = dq/dt. Therefore, di/dt = d2q/dt2. Thus, in terms of q,\n\nthe voltage equation becomes\n\nFIGURE 7.14  Impedance\n\ndiagram.\n\nFIGURE 7.15 (a) Phasor diagram of V and I.\n(b) Graphs of v and i versus ω t for a series LCR\n\ncircuit where X\nC\n > X\n\nL\n.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n247\n\nAlternating Current\n\n2\n\n2\n\nd d\nsin\n\ndd\nm\n\nq q q\nL R v t\n\nt Ct\nω+ + = (7.28)\n\nThis is like the equation for a forced, damped oscillator, [see Eq. {14.37(b)}\nin Class XI Physics Textbook].

The phenomenon of resonance is common among systems\nthat have a tendency to oscillate at a particular frequency. This frequency\n\nis called the system’s natural frequency. If such a system is driven by an\nenergy source at a frequency that is near the natural frequency, the\namplitude of oscillation is found to be large. A familiar example of this\n\nphenomenon is a child on a swing. The swing has a natural frequency\nfor swinging back and forth like a pendulum. If the child pulls on the\nrope at regular intervals and the frequency of the pulls is almost the\n\nsame as the frequency of swinging, the amplitude of the swinging will be\nlarge (Chapter 14, Class XI).\n\nFor an RLC circuit driven with voltage of amplitude v\nm\n and frequency\n\nω, we found that the current amplitude is given by\n\n2 2( )\n\nm m\nm\n\nC L\n\nv v\ni\n\nZ R X X\n= =\n\n+ −\n\nwith X\nc\n = 1/ωC and X\n\nL\n = ω L . So if ω is varied, then at a particular frequency\n\nω\n0\n, X\n\nc\n = X\n\nL\n, and the impedance is minimum ( )2 20Z R R= + = . This\n\nfrequency is called the resonant frequency:\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\norc LX X L\n\nC\nω\n\nω\n= =\n\nor   0\n1\n\nLC\nω = (7.35)\n\nAt resonant frequency, the current amplitude is maximum; i\nm\n = v\n\nm\n/R.\n\nFigure 7.16 shows the variation of i\nm\n with ω  in\n\na RLC series circuit with L = 1.00 mH, C =\n\n1.00 nF for two values of R: (i) R = 100 Ω\nand (ii) R = 200 Ω. For the source applied v\n\nm\n =\n\n100 V. ω\n0\n for this case is \n\n1\n\nLC\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n\n = 1.00×106\n\nrad/s.\n\nWe see that the current amplitude is maximum\n\nat the resonant frequency. Since i\nm \n\n= v\nm \n\n/ R at\n\nresonance, the current amplitude for case (i) is\n\ntwice to that for case (ii).\n\nResonant circuits have a variety of\n\napplications, for example, in the tuning\n\nmechanism of a radio or a TV set. The antenna of\n\na radio accepts signals from many broadcasting\n\nstations. The signals picked up in the antenna acts as a source in the\n\ntuning circuit of the radio, so the circuit can be driven at many frequencies.\n\nFIGURE 7.16 Variation of i\nm\n with ω for two\n\ncases: (i) R = 100 Ω, (ii) R = 200 Ω,\nL = 1.00 mH.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n249\n\nAlternating Current\n\nBut to hear one particular radio station, we tune the radio. In tuning, we\nvary the capacitance of a capacitor in the tuning circuit such that the\n\nresonant frequency of the circuit becomes nearly equal to the frequency\nof the radio signal received. When this happens, the amplitude of the\ncurrent with the frequency of the signal of the particular radio station in\n\nthe circuit is maximum.\nIt is important to note that resonance phenomenon is exhibited by a\n\ncircuit only if both L and C are present in the circuit. Only then do the\n\nvoltages across L and C cancel each other (both being out of phase)\n\nand the current amplitude is v\nm\n/R, the total source voltage appearing\n\nacross R. This means that we cannot have resonance in a RL or\n\nRC circuit.\n\nSharpness of resonance\n\nThe amplitude of the current in the series LCR circuit is given by\n\ni\nv\n\nR L\nC\n\nm\nm=\n\n+ −\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n2\n\n2\n1\n\nω\nω\n\nand is maximum when \n0 1/ .L Cω ω= =  The maximum value is\n\nmax\n/m mi v R= .\n\nFor values of ω other than ω\n0\n, the amplitude of the current is less\n\nthan the maximum value. Suppose we choose a value of ω  for which the\n\ncurrent amplitude is 1/ 2  times its maximum value. At this value, the\n\npower dissipated by the circuit becomes half. From the curve in\nFig. (7.16), we see that there are two such values of ω, say, ω\n\n1\n and ω\n\n2\n,\n\none greater and the other smaller than ω\n0\n and symmetrical about ω\n\n0\n. We\n\nmay write\n\nω\n1\n = ω\n\n0\n + ∆ω\n\nω\n2\n = ω\n\n0\n – ∆ω\n\nThe difference ω\n1\n – ω\n\n2\n = 2∆ω is often called the bandwidth of the\n\ncircuit. The quantity (ω\n0\n / 2∆ω) is regarded as a measure of the sharpness\n\nof resonance.

How to resolve this paradox?\nAs you have learnt in the text, the two voltages are not in the same\nphase. Therefore, they cannot be added like ordinary numbers. The\n\ntwo voltages are out of phase by ninety degrees. Therefore, the total\nof these voltages must be obtained using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n2 2\nR C R CV V V+ = +\n\n= 220 V\nThus, if the phase difference between two voltages is properly taken\n\ninto account, the total voltage across the resistor and the capacitor is\nequal to the voltage of the source.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n252  E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 7\n\n.7\n\n7.7  POWER IN AC CIRCUIT: THE POWER FACTOR\nWe have seen that a voltage v = v\n\nm\n sinωt applied to a series RLC circuit\n\ndrives a current in the circuit given by i = i\nm\n sin(ωt + φ) where\n\nm\nm\n\nv\ni\n\nZ\n=   and φ =\n\n−\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n−\ntan\n\n1 X X\n\nR\n\nC L\n\nTherefore, the instantaneous power p supplied by the source is\n\n( ) [ ]sin sin( )m mp v i v t i tω ω φ= = × +\n\n[ ]cos cos(2 )\n2\n\nm mv i tφ ω φ= − + (7.37)\n\nThe average power over a cycle is given by the average of the two terms in\nR.H.S. of Eq. (7.37). It is only the second term which is time-dependent.\nIts average is zero (the positive half of the cosine cancels the negative\n\nhalf). Therefore,\n\ncos\n2\n\nm mv iP φ= cos\n2 2\n\nm mv i φ=\n\ncosV I φ= [7.38(a)]\n\nThis can also be written as,\n\n2\ncosP I Z φ= [7.38(b)]\n\nSo, the average power dissipated depends not only on the voltage and\ncurrent but also on the cosine of the phase angle φ between them. The\nquantity cosφ is called the power factor. Let us discuss the following\ncases:\n\nCase (i) Resistive circuit: If the circuit contains only pure R, it is called\nresistive. In that case φ = 0, cos φ = 1. There is maximum power dissipation.\nCase (ii) Purely inductive or capacitive circuit: If the circuit contains\nonly an inductor or capacitor, we know that the phase difference between\n\nvoltage and current is π/2. Therefore, cos φ = 0, and no power is dissipated\neven though a current is flowing in the circuit. This current is sometimes\nreferred to as wattless current.\n\nCase (iii) LCR series circuit: In an LCR series circuit, power dissipated is\ngiven by Eq. (7.38) where φ = tan–1 (X\n\nc \n– X\n\nL \n)/ R. So,  φ may be non-zero  in\n\na RL or RC or RCL circuit. Even in such cases, power is dissipated only in\nthe resistor.\n\nCase (iv) Power dissipated at resonance in LCR circuit: At resonance\nX\n\nc\n – X\n\nL\n= 0, and φ = 0. Therefore, cosφ = 1 and P = I 2Z = I 2 R. That is,\n\nmaximum power is dissipated in a circuit (through R) at resonance.\n\nExample 7.7 (a) For circuits used for transporting electric power, a\nlow power factor implies large power loss in transmission. Explain.\n\n(b) Power factor can often be improved by the use of a capacitor of\n\nappropriate capacitance in the circuit.

But this will lead to large power loss\n(I2R) in transmission.\n\n(b)Suppose in a circuit, current I lags the voltage by an angle φ. Then\npower factor cosφ =R/Z.\nWe can improve the power factor (tending to 1) by making Z tend to R.\nLet us understand, with the help of a phasor diagram (Fig. 7.17) how\n\nthis can be achieved. Let us resolve I into two components. I\np\n along\n\nthe applied voltage V and I\nq\n perpendicular to the applied voltage. I\n\nq\n\nas you have learnt in Section 7.7, is called the wattless component\n\nsince corresponding to this component of current, there is no power\n\nloss. I\nP\n  is known as the power component because it is in phase with\n\nthe voltage and corresponds to power loss in the circuit.\n\nIt’s clear from this analysis that if we want to improve power factor,\n\nwe must completely neutralize the lagging wattless current I\nq\n by an\n\nequal leading wattless current I′\nq\n. This can be done by connecting a\n\ncapacitor of appropriate value in parallel so that I\nq\n and I′\n\nq\n cancel\n\neach other and P is effectively I\np\n V.\n\nExample 7.8 A sinusoidal voltage of peak value 283 V and frequency\n\n50 Hz is applied to a series LCR circuit in which\nR = 3 Ω, L = 25.48 mH, and C = 796 µF.

If she/he is carrying\n\nanything made of metal, the metal detector emits a sound. On what\n\nprinciple does this detector work?\n\nSolution  The metal detector works on the principle of resonance in\n\nac circuits. When you walk through a metal detector, you are,\n\nin fact, walking through a coil of many turns. The coil is connected to\n\na capacitor tuned so that the circuit is in resonance. When\n\nyou walk through with metal in your pocket, the impedance of the\n\ncircuit changes – resulting in significant change in current in the\n\ncircuit. This change in current is detected and the electronic circuitry\n\ncauses a sound to be emitted as an alarm.\n\n7.8  LC OSCILLATIONS\nWe know that a capacitor and an inductor can store electrical and\nmagnetic energy, respectively. When a capacitor (initially charged) is\n\nconnected to an inductor, the charge on the capacitor and\nthe current in the circuit exhibit the phenomenon of\nelectrical oscillations similar to oscillations in mechanical\n\nsystems (Chapter 14, Class XI).\nLet a capacitor be charged q\n\nm\n (at t = 0) and connected\n\nto an inductor as shown in Fig. 7.18.\n\nThe moment the circuit is completed, the charge on\nthe capacitor starts decreasing, giving rise to current in\nthe circuit. Let q and i be the charge and current in the\n\ncircuit at time t. Since  di/dt is positive, the induced emf\nin L will have polarity as shown, i.e., v\n\nb \n< v\n\na\n. According to\n\nKirchhoff’s loop rule,\n\nd\n0\n\nd\n\nq i\nL\n\nC t\n− = (7.39)\n\ni = – (dq/dt ) in the present case (as q decreases, i increases).\nTherefore, Eq. (7.39) becomes:\n\n2\n\n2\n\nd 1\n0\n\nd\n\nq\nq\n\nLCt\n+ = (7.40)\n\nThis equation has the form \n2\n\n2\n02\n\nd\n0\n\nd\n\nx\nx\n\nt\nω+ =  for a simple harmonic\n\noscillator. The charge on the capacitor, therefore, oscillates with a natural\nfrequency\n\n0\n\n1\n\nLC\nω = (7.41)\n\nand varies sinusoidally with time as\n\n( )0cosmq q tω φ= + (7.42)\nwhere q\n\nm\n is the maximum value of q and φ is a phase constant. Since\n\nq = q\nm\n at t = 0, we have  cos φ =1 or φ = 0. Therefore, in the present case,\n\nFIGURE 7.18 At the\ninstant shown, the current\n\nis increasing; so the\npolarity of induced emf in\nthe inductor is as shown.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n256\n\n0cos( )mq q tω= (7.43)\n\nThe current i\nq\n\nt\n= −\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\nd\n\nd\n is given by\n\n0sin( )mi i tω= (7.44)\n\nwhere 0m mi qω=\nLet us now try to visualise how this oscillation takes place in the\n\ncircuit.\nFigure 7.19(a) shows a capacitor with initial charge q\n\nm\n connected to\n\nan ideal inductor. The electrical energy stored in the charged capacitor is\n\n2\n1\n\n2\nm\n\nE\n\nq\nU\n\nC\n= . Since, there is no current in the circuit, energy in the inductor\n\nis zero. Thus, the total energy of LC circuit is,\n\n2\n1\n\n2\nm\n\nE\n\nq\nU U\n\nC\n= =\n\nFIGURE 7.19 The oscillations in an LC circuit are analogous to the oscillation of a\n\nblock at the end of a spring. The figure depicts one-half of a cycle.\n\nAt t = 0, the switch is closed and the capacitor starts to discharge\n\n[Fig. 7.19(b)]. As  the current increases, it sets up a magnetic field in the\n\ninductor and thereby, some energy gets stored in the inductor in the\n\nform of magnetic energy: U\nB\n = (1/2) Li2. As the current reaches its\n\nmaximum value i\nm\n, (at t = T/4) as in Fig. 7.19(c), all the energy is stored\n\nin the magnetic field: U\nB\n = (1/2) Li2\n\nm\n. You can easily check that the\n\nmaximum electrical energy equals the maximum magnetic energy. The\n\ncapacitor now has no charge and hence no energy. The current now\n\nstarts charging the  capacitor, as in Fig. 7.19(d). This process continues\n\ntill the capacitor is fully charged (at t = T/2) [Fig. 7.19(e)]. But it is charged\n\nwith a polarity opposite to its initial state in Fig. 7.19(a). The whole process\n\njust described will now repeat itself till the system reverts to its original\n\nstate. Thus, the energy in the system oscillates between the capacitor\n\nand the inductor.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n257\n\nAlternating Current\n\nThe LC oscillation is similar to the mechanical oscillation of a block\nattached to a spring. The lower part of each figure in Fig. 7.19 depicts\n\nthe corresponding stage of a mechanical system (a block attached to a\nspring). As noted earlier, for a block of a mass m oscillating with frequency\nω\n\n0\n, the equation is\n\n2\n2\n\n2 0\n\nd\n0\n\nd\n\nx\nx\n\nt\nω+ =\n\nHere, \n0 /k mω = , and k is the spring constant. So, x corresponds to q.\n\nIn case of a mechanical system F = ma = m (dv/dt) = m (d2x/dt2). For an\nelectrical system, ε = –L (di/dt ) = –L (d2q/dt2). Comparing these two\nequations, we see that L is analogous to mass m: L is a measure of\n\nresistance to change in current. In case of LC circuit, 0 1/ LCω =  and\n\nfor mass on a spring, \n0 /k mω = . So,  1/C is analogous to k. The constant\n\nk (=F/x) tells us the (external) force required to produce a unit\n\ndisplacement whereas 1/C (=V/q ) tells us the potential difference required\nto store a unit charge. Table 7.1 gives the analogy between mechanical\nand electrical quantities.\n\nTABLE 7.1 ANALOGIES BETWEEN MECHANICAL AND\nELECTRICAL QUANTITIES\n\nMechanical system Electrical system\n\nMass m Inductance L\n\nForce constant k Reciprocal capacitance\n1/C\n\nDisplacement x Charge q\n\nVelocity v = dx/dt Current i = dq/dt\n\nMechanical energy Electromagnetic energy\n\n2 21 1\n\n2 2\nE kx mv= +\n\n2\n21 1\n\n2 2\n\nq\nU L i\n\nC\n= +\n\nNote that the above discussion of LC oscillations is not realistic for two\n\nreasons:\n(i) Every inductor has some resistance. The effect of this resistance is to\n\nintroduce a damping effect on the charge and current in the circuit\nand the oscillations finally die away.\n\n(ii) Even if the resistance were zero, the total energy of the system would\n\nnot remain constant. It is radiated away from the system in the form\nof electromagnetic waves (discussed in the next chapter). In fact, radio\nand TV transmitters depend on this radiation.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n258\n\nTWO DIFFERENT PHENOMENA, SAME MATHEMATICAL TREATMENT\n\nYou may like to compare the treatment of a forced damped oscillator discussed in Section\n14.10 of Class XI physics textbook, with that of an LCR circuit when an ac voltage is\napplied in it.

Why it is\nso? Think!\n\n7.9  TRANSFORMERS\nFor many purposes, it is necessary to change (or transform) an alternating\n\nvoltage from one to another of greater or smaller value. This is done with\n\na device called transformer using the principle of mutual induction.\n\nA transformer consists of two sets of coils, insulated from each other.\n\nThey are wound on a soft-iron core, either one on top of the other as in\n\nFig. 7.20(a) or on separate limbs of the core as in Fig. 7.20(b). One of the\n\ncoils called the primary coil has N\np\n turns. The other coil is called the\n\nsecondary coil; it has N\ns\n turns. Often the primary coil is the input coil\n\nand the secondary coil is the output coil of the transformer.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n260\n\nWhen an alternating voltage is applied to the  primary, the resulting\ncurrent produces an alternating magnetic flux which links the secondary\n\nand induces an emf in it. The value of this emf depends on the number of\nturns in the secondary. We consider an ideal transformer in which the\nprimary has negligible resistance and all the flux in the core links both\n\nprimary and secondary windings. Let φ be the flux in each turn in the\ncore at time t due to current in the primary when a voltage v\n\np\n is applied\n\nto it.\n\nThen the induced emf or voltage ε\ns\n, in the secondary with N\n\ns\n turns is\n\nd\n\nd\ns sN\n\nt\n\nφ\nε = − (7.45)\n\nThe alternating flux φ also induces an emf, called back emf in the\nprimary. This is\n\nd\n\nd\np pN\n\nt\n\nφ\nε = − (7.46)\n\nBut ε\np\n = v\n\np\n. If this were not so, the primary current would be infinite\n\nsince the  primary has zero resistance (as assumed). If the secondary is\n\nan open circuit or the current taken from it is small, then to a good\napproximation\n\nε\ns\n = v\n\ns\n\nwhere  v\ns\n is the voltage across the secondary. Therefore, Eqs. (7.45) and\n\n(7.46) can be written as\n\ns s\n\nd\nv N\n\nd t\n\nφ\n= − [7.45(a)]\n\np p\n\nd\nv N\n\nd t\n\nφ\n= − [7.46(a)]\n\nFrom Eqs. [7.45 (a)] and [7.46 (a)], we have\n\ns s\n\np p\n\nv N\n\nv N\n= (7.47)\n\nFIGURE 7.20 Two arrangements for winding of primary and secondary coil in a transformer:\n(a) two coils on top of each other, (b) two coils on separate limbs of the core.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n261\n\nAlternating Current\n\nNote that the above relation has been obtained using three\nassumptions: (i) the primary resistance and current are small; (ii) the\n\nsame flux links both the primary and the secondary as very little flux\nescapes from the core, and (iii) the secondary current is small.\n\nIf the transformer is assumed to be 100% efficient (no energy losses),\n\nthe power input is equal to the power output, and since p = i v,\n\ni\np\nv\n\np\n = i\n\ns\nv\n\ns\n(7.48)\n\nAlthough some energy is always lost, this is a good approximation,\nsince a well designed transformer may have an efficiency of more than\n\n95%. Combining Eqs. (7.47) and (7.48), we have\n\np s s\n\ns p p\n\ni v N\n\ni v N\n= = (7.49)\n\nSince i and v both oscillate with the same frequency as the ac source,\nEq. (7.49) also gives the ratio of the amplitudes or rms values of\ncorresponding quantities.\n\nNow, we can see how a transformer affects the voltage and current.\nWe have:\n\nV\nN\n\nN\nVs\n\ns\n\np\n\np=\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f7    and  I\n\nN\n\nN\nIs\n\np\n\ns\n\np=\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7 (7.50)\n\nThat is, if the secondary coil has a greater number of turns than the\n\nprimary (N\ns\n > N\n\np\n), the voltage is stepped up (V\n\ns\n > V\n\np\n). This type of\n\narrangement is called a step-up transformer. However, in this arrangement,\nthere is less current in the secondary than in the primary (N\n\np\n/N\n\ns\n < 1 and I\n\ns\n\n< I\np\n). For example, if the primary coil of a transformer has 100 turns and\n\nthe secondary has 200 turns,  N\ns\n/N\n\np\n = 2 and N\n\np\n/N\n\ns\n=1/2. Thus, a 220V\n\ninput at 10A will step-up to 440 V output at 5.0 A.\n\nIf the secondary coil has less turns than the primary (N\ns\n < N\n\np\n), we\n\nhave a step-down transformer. In this case, V\ns\n < V\n\np\n and I\n\ns\n > I\n\np\n. That is, the\n\nvoltage is stepped down, or reduced, and the current is increased.\n\nThe equations obtained above apply to ideal transformers (without\nany energy losses). But in actual transformers, small energy losses do\noccur due to the following reasons:\n\n(i) Flux Leakage: There is always some flux leakage; that is, not all of\nthe flux due to primary passes through the secondary due to poor\ndesign of the core or the air gaps in the core. It can be reduced by\n\nwinding the primary and secondary coils one over the other.\n\n(ii) Resistance of the windings: The wire used for the windings has some\n\nresistance and so, energy is lost due to heat produced in the wire\n(I 2R). In high current, low voltage windings, these are minimised by\nusing thick wire.\n\n(iii) Eddy currents: The alternating magnetic flux induces eddy currents\nin the iron core and causes heating. The effect is reduced by using a\nlaminated core.\n\n(iv) Hysteresis: The magnetisation of the core is repeatedly reversed by\nthe alternating magnetic field. The resulting expenditure of energy in\n\nthe core appears as heat and is kept to a minimum by using a magnetic\nmaterial which has a low hysteresis loss.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n262\n\nThe large scale transmission and distribution of electrical energy over\nlong distances is done with the use of transformers. The voltage output\n\nof the generator is stepped-up (so that current is reduced and\nconsequently, the I 2R loss is cut down). It is then transmitted over long\ndistances to an area sub-station near the consumers. There the voltage\n\nis stepped down. It is further stepped down at distributing sub-stations\nand utility poles before a power supply of 240 V reaches our homes.\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. An alternating voltage sin= ω\nm\n\nv v t  applied to a resistor R drives a\n\ncurrent i = i\nm\n sinωt in the resistor, \n\nm\nm\n\nv\ni\n\nR\n= . The current is in phase with\n\nthe applied voltage.\n\n2. For an alternating current i = i\nm\n sin ωt passing through a resistor R, the\n\naverage power loss P (averaged over a cycle) due to joule heating is\n( 1/2 )i\n\n2\nm\nR. To express it in the same form as the dc power (P = I\n\n2\nR), a\n\nspecial value of current is used. It is called root mean square (rms)\ncurrent and is donoted by I:\n\n0.707\n2\n\nm\nm\n\ni\nI i= =\n\nSimilarly, the rms voltage is defined by\n\n0.707\n2\n\nm\nm\n\nv\nV v= =\n\nWe have P = IV = I\n2\nR\n\n3. An ac voltage v = v\nm\n sin ωt applied to a pure inductor L, drives a current\n\nin the inductor i = i\nm\n sin (ωt – π/2), where i\n\nm\n = v\n\nm\n/X\n\nL\n. X\n\nL\n = ωL is called\n\ninductive reactance. The current in the inductor lags the voltage by\nπ/2. The average power supplied to an inductor over one complete cycle\nis zero.\n\n4. An ac voltage v = v\nm\n sinωt applied to a capacitor drives a current in the\n\ncapacitor: i = i\nm\n sin (ωt + π/2). Here,\n\n1\n,mm C\n\nC\n\nv\ni X\n\nX Cω\n= =  is called capacitive reactance.\n\nThe current through the capacitor is π/2 ahead of the applied voltage.\nAs in the case of inductor, the average power supplied to a capacitor\nover one complete cycle is zero.\n\n5. For a series RLC circuit driven by voltage v = v\nm\n sin ωt, the current is\n\ngiven by i = i\nm\n sin (ωt + φ )\n\nwhere\n\n( )22\nm\n\nm\n\nC L\n\nv\ni\n\nR X X\n=\n\n+ −\n\nand 1tan C L\nX X\n\nR\nφ −\n\n−\n=\n\n( )22 C LZ R X X= + −  is called the impedance of the circuit.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n263\n\nAlternating Current\n\nThe average power loss over a complete cycle is given by\n\nP = V I cosφ\nThe term cosφ is called the power factor.\n\n6. In a purely inductive or capacitive circuit, cosφ = 0 and no power is\ndissipated even though a current is flowing in the circuit. In such cases,\ncurrent is referred to as a wattless current.\n\n7. The phase relationship between current and voltage in an ac circuit\ncan be shown conveniently by representing voltage and current by\nrotating vectors called phasors. A phasor is a vector which rotates\nabout the origin with angular speed ω. The magnitude of a phasor\nrepresents the amplitude or peak value of the quantity (voltage or\ncurrent) represented by the phasor.\n\nThe analysis of an ac circuit is facilitated by the use of a phasor\ndiagram.\n\n8. An interesting characteristic of a series RLC circuit is the\nphenomenon of resonance. The circuit exhibits resonance, i.e.,\nthe amplitude of the current is maximum at the resonant\n\nfrequency, \n0\n\n1\n\nLC\nω = . The quality factor Q defined by\n\n0LQ\nR\n\nω\n=\n\n0\n\n1\n\nCRω\n=  is an indicator of the sharpness of the resonance,\n\nthe higher value of Q indicating sharper peak in the current.\n\n9. A circuit containing an inductor L and a capacitor C (initially\ncharged) with no ac source and no resistors exhibits free\noscillations. The charge q of the capacitor satisfies the equation\nof simple harmonic motion:\n\n2\n\n2\n\nd 1\n0\n\nq\nq\n\nLCdt\n+ =\n\nand therefore, the frequency ω of free oscillation is 0\n1\n\nLC\nω = . The\n\nenergy in the system oscillates between the capacitor and the\ninductor but their sum or the total energy is constant in time.\n\n10. A transformer consists of an iron core on which are bound a\nprimary coil of N\n\np\n turns and a secondary coil of N\n\ns\n turns. If the\n\nprimary coil is connected to an ac source, the primary and\nsecondary voltages are related by\n\nV\nN\n\nN\nVs\n\ns\n\np\n\np=\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f7\n\nand the currents are related by\n\nI\nN\n\nN\nIs\n\np\n\ns\n\np=\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\nIf the secondary coil has a greater number of turns than the primary, the\nvoltage is stepped-up (V\n\ns\n > V\n\np\n). This type of arrangement is called a step-\n\nup transformer. If the secondary coil has turns less than the primary, we\nhave a step-down transformer.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n264\n\n Physical quantity Symbol Dimensions Unit Remarks\n\nrms voltage V [M L\n2 \nT\n\n–3 \nA\n\n–1\n] V V = \n\n2\n\nmv\n, v\n\nm\n is the\n\namplitude of the ac voltage.\n\nrms current I [\n \nA] A I = \n\n2\n\nmi\n, i\n\nm\n is the amplitude of\n\nthe ac current.\n\nReactance:\n     Inductive X\n\nL\n[M\n\n \nL\n\n2 \nT\n\n–3 \nA\n\n–2\n] X\n\nL\n = ω L\n\n     Capacitive X\nC\n\n[M\n \nL\n\n2 \nT\n\n–3 \nA\n\n–2\n] X\n\nC\n = 1/ω C\n\nImpedance Z [M\n \nL\n\n2 \nT\n\n–3 \nA\n\n–2\n] Depends on elements\n\npresent in the circuit.\n\nResonant ω\nr\n or ω\n\n0\n[T\n\n–1\n] Hz ω\n\n0 \nLC\n\n1\n=  for a\n\nfrequency\nseries RLC circuit\n\nQuality factor Q Dimensionless\n0\n\n0\n\n1L\nQ\n\nR C R\n\nω\nω\n\n= =  for a series\n\nRLC circuit.\n\nPower factor Dimensionless = cosφ, φ is the phase\ndifference between voltage\napplied and current in\n\nthe circuit.\n\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n\n1. When a value is given for ac voltage or current, it is ordinarily the rms\n\nvalue. The voltage across the terminals of an outlet in your room is\n\nnormally 240 V. This refers to the rms value of the voltage. The amplitude\n\nof this voltage is\n\nV2 2(240) 340mv V= = =\n\n2. The power rating of an element used in ac circuits refers to its average\n\npower rating.\n\n3. The power consumed in an ac circuit is never negative.\n\n4. Both alternating current and direct current are measured in amperes.\n\nBut how is the ampere defined for an alternating current? It cannot be\n\nderived from the mutual attraction of two parallel wires carrying ac\n\ncurrents, as the dc ampere is derived. An ac current changes direction\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n265\n\nAlternating Current\n\nwith the source frequency and the attractive force would average to\n\nzero. Thus, the ac ampere must be defined in terms of some property\n\nthat is independent of the direction of the current. Joule heating\n\nis such a property, and there is one ampere of rms value of\n\nalternating current in a circuit if the current produces the same\n\naverage heating effect as one ampere of dc current would produce\n\nunder the same conditions.\n\n5. In an ac circuit, while adding voltages across different elements, one\n\nshould take care of their phases properly. For example, if V\nR\n and V\n\nC\n\nare voltages across R and C, respectively in an RC circuit, then the\n\ntotal voltage across RC combination is 2 2\nRC R CV V V= +  and not\n\nV\nR\n + V\n\nC\n since V\n\nC\n is π/2 out of phase of V\n\nR\n.\n\n6. Though in a phasor diagram, voltage and current are represented by\nvectors, these quantities are not really vectors themselves. They are\nscalar quantities. It so happens that the amplitudes and phases of\nharmonically varying scalars combine mathematically in the same\nway as do the projections of rotating vectors of corresponding\nmagnitudes and directions. The ‘rotating vectors’ that represent\nharmonically varying scalar quantities are introduced only to provide\nus with a simple way of adding these quantities using a rule that\nwe already know as the law of vector addition.\n\n7. There are no power losses associated with pure capacitances and pure\ninductances in an ac circuit. The only element that dissipates energy\nin an ac circuit is the resistive element.\n\n8. In a RLC circuit, resonance phenomenon occur when X\nL\n = X\n\nC\n or\n\n0\n\n1\n\nLC\nω = . For resonance to occur, the presence of both L and C\n\nelements in the circuit is a must. With only one of these (L or C )\nelements, there is no possibility of voltage cancellation and hence,\nno resonance is possible.\n\n9. The power factor in a RLC circuit is a measure of how close the\ncircuit is to expending the maximum power.\n\n10. In generators and motors, the roles of input and output are\nreversed. In a motor, electric energy is the input and mechanical\nenergy is the output. In a generator, mechanical energy is the\ninput and electric energy is the output. Both devices simply\ntransform energy from one form to another.\n\n11. A transformer (step-up) changes a low-voltage into a high-voltage.\nThis does not violate the law of conservation of energy. The\ncurrent is reduced by the same proportion.\n\n12. The choice of whether the description of an oscillatory motion is\nby means of sines or cosines or by their linear combinations is\nunimportant, since changing the zero-time position transforms\nthe one to the other.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n266\n\nEXERCISES\n\n7.1 A 100 Ω resistor is connected to a 220 V, 50 Hz ac supply.\n(a) What is the rms value of current in the circuit?\n(b) What is the net power consumed over a full cycle?\n\n7.2 (a) The peak voltage of an ac supply is 300 V.

If the turbine\n\ngenerator efficiency is 60%, estimate the electric power available\nfrom the plant (g = 9.8 ms\n\n–2\n).\n\n7.25 A small town with a demand of 800 kW of electric power at 220 V is\nsituated 15 km away from an electric plant generating power at 440 V.\nThe resistance of the two wire line carrying power is 0.5 Ω per km.\nThe town gets power from the line through a 4000-220 V step-down\ntransformer at a sub-station in the town.\n\n(a) Estimate the line power loss in the form of heat.\n\n(b) How much power must the plant supply, assuming there is\nnegligible power loss due to leakage?\n\n(c) Characterise the step up transformer at the plant.\n\n7.26 Do the same exercise as above with the replacement of the earlier\ntransformer by a 40,000-220 V step-down transformer (Neglect, as\nbefore, leakage losses though this may not be a good assumption\nany longer because of the very high voltage transmission involved).\nHence, explain why high voltage transmission is preferred?\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n\n')('status', 200)
