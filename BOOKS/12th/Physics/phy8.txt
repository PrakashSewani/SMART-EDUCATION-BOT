Is the converse also true? Does an\nelectric field changing with time give rise to a magnetic field? James Clerk\nMaxwell (1831-1879), argued that this was indeed the case – not only\nan electric current but also a time-varying electric field generates magnetic\nfield. While applying the Ampere’s circuital law to find magnetic field at a\npoint outside a capacitor connected to a time-varying current, Maxwell\nnoticed an inconsistency in the Ampere’s circuital law. He suggested the\nexistence of an additional current, called by him, the displacement\ncurrent to remove this inconsistency.\n\nMaxwell formulated a set of equations involving electric and magnetic\nfields, and their sources, the charge and current densities. These\nequations are known as Maxwell’s equations. Together with the Lorentz\nforce formula (Chapter 4), they mathematically express all the basic laws\nof electromagnetism.\n\nThe most important prediction to emerge from Maxwell’s equations\nis the existence of electromagnetic waves, which are (coupled) time-\nvarying electric and magnetic fields that propagate in space. The speed\nof the waves,  according to these equations, turned out to be very close to\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n270\n\nthe speed of light( 3 ×108 m/s), obtained from optical\nmeasurements. This led to the remarkable conclusion\nthat light is an electromagnetic wave. Maxwell’s work\nthus unified the domain of electricity, magnetism and\nlight. Hertz, in 1885, experimentally demonstrated the\nexistence of electromagnetic waves. Its technological use\nby Marconi and others led in due course to the\nrevolution in communication that we are witnessing\ntoday.\n\nIn this chapter, we first discuss the need for\ndisplacement current and its consequences. Then we\npresent a descriptive account of electromagnetic waves.\nThe broad spectrum of electromagnetic waves,\nstretching from γ rays (wavelength ~10–12 m) to long\nradio waves (wavelength ~106 m) is described. How the\nelectromagnetic waves are sent and received for\ncommunication is discussed in Chapter 15.\n\n8.2  DISPLACEMENT CURRENT\nWe have seen in Chapter 4 that an electrical current\nproduces a magnetic field around it. Maxwell showed\nthat for logical consistency, a changing electric field must\nalso produce a magnetic field. This effect is of great\nimportance because it explains the existence of radio\nwaves, gamma rays and visible light, as well as all other\nforms of electromagnetic waves.\n\nTo see how a changing electric field gives rise to\na magnetic field, let us consider the process of\ncharging of a capacitor and apply Ampere’s circuital\nlaw given by (Chapter 4)\n\n“B.dl = µ\n0 \n\ni (t )           (8.1)\n\nto find magnetic  field at a point outside the capacitor.\nFigure 8.1(a)  shows a parallel plate capacitor C which\nis a part of circuit through which a time-dependent\ncurrent i (t ) flows . Let us find the magnetic field at a\npoint such as P, in a region outside the parallel plate\ncapacitor.  For this, we consider a plane circular loop of\nradius r whose plane is perpendicular to the direction\nof the current-carrying wire, and which is centred\nsymmetrically with respect to the wire [Fig. 8.1(a)]. From\nsymmetry, the magnetic field is directed along the\ncircumference of the circular loop and is the same in\nmagnitude at all points on the loop so that if B is the\nmagnitude of the field, the left side of Eq. (8.1) is B (2π r).\nSo we have\n\nB (2πr) = µ\n0\ni (t )    (8 .2)\n\nJ\nA\n\nM\nE\n\nS\n C\n\nL\nE\n\nR\nK\n\n M\nA\n\nX\nW\n\nE\nL\nL\n (\n1\n8\n3\n1\n–1\n\n8\n7\n9\n)\n\nJames Clerk Maxwell\n(1831 – 1879) Born in\nEdinburgh, Scotland,\nwas among the greatest\nphysicists of the\nnineteenth century. He\nderived the thermal\nvelocity distribution of\nmolecules in a gas and\nwas among the first to\nobtain reliable\nestimates of molecular\nparameters from\nmeasurable quantities\nlike viscosity, etc.\nMaxwell’s greatest\nacheivement was the\nunification of the laws of\nelectricity and\nmagnetism (discovered\nby Coulomb, Oersted,\nAmpere and Faraday)\ninto a consistent set of\nequations now called\nMaxwell’s equations.\nFrom these he arrived at\nthe most important\nconclusion that light is\nan electromagnetic\nwave. Interestingly,\nMaxwell did not agree\nwith the idea (strongly\nsuggested by the\nFaraday’s laws of\nelectrolysis) that\nelectricity was\nparticulate in nature.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n271\n\nElectromagnetic\n\nWaves\n\nNow, consider a different surface, which has the same boundary. This\nis a pot like surface [Fig. 8.1(b)] which nowhere touches the current, but\nhas its bottom between the capacitor plates; its mouth is the circular\nloop mentioned above. Another such surface is shaped like a tiffin box\n(without the lid) [Fig. 8.1(c)]. On applying Ampere’s circuital law to such\nsurfaces with the same perimeter, we find that the left hand side of\nEq. (8.1) has not changed but the right hand side is zero and not µ\n\n0\ni,\n\nsince no current passes through the surface of Fig. 8.1(b) and (c). So we\nhave a contradiction; calculated one way, there is a magnetic field at a\npoint P; calculated another way, the magnetic field at P is zero.\nSince the contradiction arises from our use of Ampere’s circuital law,\nthis law must be missing something. The missing term must be such\nthat one gets the same magnetic field at point P,  no matter what surface\nis used.\n\nWe can actually guess the missing term by looking carefully at\nFig. 8.1(c). Is there anything passing through the surface S between the\nplates of the capacitor? Yes, of course, the electric field! If the plates of the\ncapacitor have an area A, and a total charge Q, the magnitude of the\nelectric field E between the plates is (Q/A)/ε\n\n0\n (see Eq. 2.41). The field is\n\nperpendicular to the surface S of Fig. 8.1(c). It has the same magnitude\nover the area A of the capacitor plates, and vanishes outside it. So what\nis the electric flux Φ\n\nE\n through the surface S ? Using Gauss’s law, it is\n\nE\n0 0\n\n1\n= =\n\nQ Q\nA A\n\nA\nΦ\n\nε ε\n=E (8.3)\n\nNow if the charge Q on the capacitor plates changes with time, there is a\ncurrent i = (dQ/dt), so that using Eq. (8.3), we have\n\nd\nd\n\nd\nd\n\nd\nd\n\nΦE\nt t\n\nQ Q\n\nt\n=\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n=\nε ε0 0\n\n1\n\nThis implies that for consistency,\n\nε0\nd\nd\nΦE\nt\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n = i (8.4)\n\nThis is the missing term in Ampere’s circuital law. If we generalise\nthis law by adding to the total current carried by conductors through\nthe surface, another term which is ε\n\n0\n times the rate of change of electric\n\nflux through the same surface, the total has the same value of current i\nfor all surfaces. If this is done, there is no contradiction in the value of B\nobtained anywhere using the generalised Ampere’s law. B at the point P\nis non-zero no matter which surface is used for calculating it. B at a\npoint P outside the plates [Fig. 8.1(a)] is the same as at a point M just\ninside, as it should be. The current carried by conductors due to flow of\ncharges is called conduction current. The current, given by Eq. (8.4), is a\nnew term, and is due to changing electric field (or electric displacement,\nan old term still used sometimes). It is, therefore, called displacement\ncurrent or Maxwell’s displacement current. Figure 8.2 shows the electric\nand magnetic fields inside the parallel plate capacitor discussed above.\n\nThe generalisation made by Maxwell then is the following. The source\nof a magnetic field is not just the conduction electric current due to flowing\n\nFIGURE 8.1 A\nparallel plate\n\ncapacitor C, as part of\na circuit through\n\nwhich a time\ndependent current\n\ni (t) flows,  (a) a loop of\nradius r, to determine\n\nmagnetic field at a\npoint P on the loop;\n\n(b) a pot-shaped\nsurface passing\n\nthrough the interior\nbetween the capacitor\n\nplates with the loop\nshown in (a) as its\n\nrim; (c) a tiffin-\nshaped surface with\nthe circular loop as\n\nits rim and a flat\ncircular bottom S\n\nbetween the capacitor\nplates. The arrows\n\nshow uniform electric\nfield between the\ncapacitor plates.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n272\n\ncharges, but also the time rate of change of electric field. More\nprecisely, the total current i is the sum of the conduction current\ndenoted by i\n\nc\n, and the displacement current denoted by id (= ε0 (dΦE/\n\ndt)). So we have\n\n0\n\nd\nd\n\nE\nc d ci i i i\n\nt\n\nΦ\nε= + = + (8.5)\n\nIn explicit terms, this means that outside the capacitor plates,\nwe have only conduction current i\n\nc\n = i, and no displacement\n\ncurrent, i.e., i\nd\n = 0. On the other hand, inside the capacitor, there is\n\nno conduction current, i.e., ic = 0, and there is only displacement\ncurrent, so that i\n\nd\n = i.\n\nThe generalised (and correct) Ampere’s circuital law has the same\nform as Eq. (8.1), with one difference: “the total current passing\nthrough any surface of which the closed loop is the perimeter” is\nthe sum of the conduction current and the displacement current.\nThe generalised law is\n\nB liÑ d =\nd\nd\n\n0µ µ ε0 0i\nt\n\nc\nE+∫\n\nΦ\n(8.6)\n\nand is known as Ampere-Maxwell law.\nIn all respects, the displacement current has the same physical\n\neffects as the conduction current. In some cases, for example, steady\nelectric fields in a conducting wire, the displacement current may\nbe zero since the electric field E does not change with time. In other\ncases, for example, the charging capacitor above, both conduction\nand displacement currents may be present in different regions of\nspace. In most of the cases, they both may be present in the same\nregion of space, as there exist no perfectly conducting or perfectly\ninsulating medium. Most interestingly, there may be large regions\nof space where there is no conduction current, but there is only a\ndisplacement current due to time-varying electric fields. In such a\nregion, we expect a magnetic field, though there is no (conduction)\n\ncurrent source nearby! The prediction of such a displacement current\ncan be verified experimentally. For example, a magnetic field (say at point\nM) between the plates of the capacitor in Fig. 8.2(a) can be measured and\nis seen to be the same as that just outside (at P).\n\nThe displacement current has (literally) far reaching consequences.\nOne thing we immediately notice is that the laws of electricity and\nmagnetism are now more symmetrical*. Faraday’s law of induction states\nthat there is an induced emf equal to the rate of change of magnetic flux.\nNow, since the emf between two points 1 and 2 is the work done per unit\ncharge in taking it from 1 to 2, the existence of an emf implies the existence\nof an electric field. So, we can rephrase Faraday’s law of electromagnetic\ninduction by saying that a magnetic field, changing with time, gives rise\nto an electric field. Then, the fact that an electric field changing with\ntime gives rise to a magnetic field, is the symmetrical counterpart, and is\n\nFIGURE 8.2 (a) The\nelectric and magnetic\nfields E and B between\nthe capacitor plates, at\nthe point M. (b) A cross\nsectional view of Fig. (a).\n\n* They are still not perfectly symmetrical; there are no known sources of magnetic\nfield (magnetic monopoles) analogous to electric charges which are sources of\nelectric field.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n273\n\nElectromagnetic\n\nWaves\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\n\nE\n 8\n\n.1\n\na consequence of the displacement current being a source of a magnetic\nfield. Thus, time- dependent electric and magnetic fields give rise to each\nother! Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction and Ampere-Maxwell\nlaw give a quantitative expression of this statement, with the current\nbeing the total current, as in Eq. (8.5). One very important consequence\nof this symmetry is the existence of electromagnetic waves, which we\ndiscuss qualitatively in the next section.\n\nMAXWELL’S EQUATIONS IN VACUUM\n\n1.

Neither stationary charges\nnor charges in uniform motion (steady currents) can be sources of\nelectromagnetic waves. The former produces only electrostatic fields, while\nthe latter produces magnetic fields that, however, do not vary with time.\nIt is an important result of Maxwell’s theory that accelerated charges\nradiate electromagnetic waves. The proof of this basic result is beyond\nthe scope of this book, but we can accept it on the basis of rough,\nqualitative reasoning. Consider a charge oscillating with some frequency.\n(An oscillating charge is an example of accelerating charge.)   This\nproduces an oscillating electric field in space, which produces an oscillating\nmagnetic field, which in turn, is a source of oscillating electric field, and\nso on. The oscillating electric and magnetic fields thus regenerate each\nother, so to speak, as the wave propagates through the space.\nThe frequency of the electromagnetic wave naturally equals the\nfrequency of oscillation of the charge. The energy associated with the\npropagating wave comes at the expense of the energy of the source – the\naccelerated charge.\n\nFrom the preceding discussion, it might appear easy to test the\nprediction that light is an electromagnetic wave. We might think that all\nwe needed to do was to set up an ac circuit in which the current oscillate\nat the frequency of visible light, say, yellow light. But, alas, that is not\npossible. The frequency of yellow light is about 6 × 1014 Hz, while the\nfrequency that we get even with modern electronic circuits is hardly about\n1011 Hz. This is why the experimental demonstration of electromagnetic\nwave had to come in the low frequency region (the radio wave region), as\nin the Hertz’s experiment (1887).\n\nHertz’s successful experimental test of Maxwell’s theory created a\nsensation and sparked off other important works in this field. Two\nimportant achievements in this connection deserve mention.

It appears reasonable, say from our\ndiscussion of the displacement current. Consider\nFig. 8.2. The electric field inside the plates of the capacitor\nis directed perpendicular to the plates. The magnetic\nfield this gives rise to via the displacement current is\nalong the perimeter of a circle parallel to the capacitor\nplates. So B and E are perpendicular in this case. This\nis a general feature.\n\nIn Fig. 8.4, we show a typical example of a plane\nelectromagnetic wave propagating along the z direction\n(the fields are shown as a function of the z coordinate,\nat a given time t). The electric field E\n\nx\n is along the x-axis,\n\nand varies sinusoidally with z, at a given time. The\nmagnetic field B\n\ny\n is along the y-axis, and again varies\n\nsinusoidally with z. The electric and magnetic fields E\nx\n\nand B\ny\n are perpendicular to each other, and to the\n\ndirection z of propagation. We can write E\nx\n and B\n\ny\n as\n\nfollows:\n\nE\nx\n= E\n\n0\n sin (kz–ωt ) [8.7(a)]\n\nB\ny\n= B\n\n0\n sin (kz–ωt ) [8.7(b)]\n\nHere k is related to the wave length λ of the wave by the\nusual equation\n\n2\nk\n\nλ\nπ\n\n= (8.8)\n\nand ω   is the angular frequency.\nk is the magnitude of the wave\nvector (or propagation vector) k\nand its direction describes the\ndirection of propagation of the\nwave. The speed of propagation\nof the wave is (ω/k ). Using\nEqs. [8.7(a) and (b)] for E\n\nx\n and B\n\ny\n\nand Maxwell’s equations, one\nfinds that\n\nHeinrich Rudolf Hertz\n\n(1857 – 1894) German\nphysicist who was the\nfirst to broadcast and\nreceive radio waves. He\nproduced electro-\nmagnetic waves, sent\nthem through space, and\nmeasured their wave-\nlength and speed. He\nshowed that the nature\nof their vibration,\nreflection and refraction\nwas the same as that of\nlight and heat waves,\nestablishing their\nidentity for the first time.\nHe also pioneered\nresearch on discharge of\nelectricity through gases,\nand discovered the\nphotoelectric effect.\n\nH\nE\n\nIN\nR\n\nIC\nH\n\n R\nU\n\nD\nO\n\nL\nF\n H\n\nE\nR\n\nT\nZ\n (1\n\n8\n5\n7\n–1\n\n8\n9\n4\n)\n\nFIGURE 8.4 A linearly polarised electromagnetic wave,\npropagating in the z-direction with the oscillating electric field E\nalong the x-direction and the oscillating magnetic field B along\n\nthe y-direction.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n276\n\nω = ck, where, c = 1/ 0 0µ ε [8.9(a)]\nThe relation ω = ck is the standard one for waves (see for example,\n\nSection 15.4 of class XI Physics textbook).

They differ from all the other waves we have studied\nso far, in respect that no material medium is involved in the vibrations of\nthe electric and magnetic fields. Sound waves in air are longitudinal waves\nof compression and rarefaction. Transverse elastic (sound) waves can\nalso propagate in a solid, which is rigid and that resists shear. Scientists\nin the nineteenth century were so much used to this mechanical picture\nthat they thought that there must be some medium pervading all space\nand all matter, which responds to electric and magnetic fields just as any\nelastic medium does. They called this medium ether. They were so\nconvinced of the reality of this medium, that there is even a novel called\nThe Poison Belt by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (the creator of the famous\ndetective Sherlock Holmes) where the solar system is supposed to pass\nthrough a poisonous region of ether! We now accept that no such physical\nmedium is needed. The famous experiment of Michelson and Morley in\n1887 demolished conclusively the hypothesis of ether. Electric and\nmagnetic fields, oscillating in space and time, can sustain each other in\nvacuum.\n\nBut what if a material medium is actually there? We know that light,\nan electromagnetic wave, does propagate through glass, for example. We\nhave seen earlier that the total electric and magnetic fields inside a\nmedium are described in terms of a permittivity ε and a magnetic\npermeability µ (these describe the factors  by which the total fields differ\nfrom the external fields). These replace ε\n\n0\n and µ\n\n0\n in the description to\n\nelectric and magnetic fields in Maxwell’s equations with the result that in\na material medium of permittivity ε and magnetic permeability µ, the\nvelocity of light becomes,\n\n1\nv\n\nµε\n= (8.11)\n\nThus, the velocity of light depends on electric and magnetic properties of\nthe medium. We shall see in the next chapter that the refractive index of\none medium with respect to the other is equal to the ratio of velocities of\nlight in the two media.\n\nThe velocity of electromagnetic waves in free space or vacuum is an\nimportant fundamental constant. It has been shown by experiments on\nelectromagnetic waves of different wavelengths that this velocity is the\n\nS\nim\n\nu\nla\n\nte\n \np\n\nro\np\n\na\ng\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n \no\n\nf \ne\nle\n\nc\ntr\n\no\nm\n\na\ng\n\nn\ne\nti\n\nc\n \nw\n\na\nv\ne\ns\n\n(i\n)\n\nh\ntt\np\n:/\n/w\n\nw\nw\n\n.a\nm\n\na\nn\no\ng\na\nw\n\na\n.c\n\no\nm\n\n/w\na\nv\ne\ns.\n\nh\ntm\n\nl\n(i\ni)\n\nh\ntt\np\n:/\n/w\n\nw\nw\n\n.p\nh\ny\ns.\n\nh\na\nw\n\na\nii\n.e\n\nd\nu\n/~\n\nte\nb\n/j\na\nv\na\n/n\n\ntn\nu\nja\n\nv\na\n/e\n\nm\nW\n\na\nv\ne\n/e\n\nm\nW\n\na\nv\ne\n.h\n\ntm\nl\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n277\n\nElectromagnetic\n\nWaves\n\nsame (independent of wavelength) to within a few metres per second, out\nof a value of 3×108 m/s. The constancy of the velocity of em waves in\nvacuum is so strongly supported by experiments and the actual value is\nso well known now that this is used to define a standard of length.\nNamely, the metre is now defined as the distance travelled by light in\nvacuum in a time (1/c) seconds = (2.99792458 × 108)–1 seconds. This\nhas come about for the following reason. The basic unit of time can be\ndefined very accurately in terms of some atomic frequency, i.e., frequency\nof light emitted by an atom in a particular process. The basic unit of length\nis harder to define as accurately in a direct way. Earlier measurement of c\nusing earlier units of length (metre rods, etc.) converged to a value of about\n2.9979246 × 108 m/s. Since c is such a strongly fixed number, unit of\nlength can be defined in terms of c and the unit of time!\n\nHertz not only showed the existence of electromagnetic waves, but\nalso demonstrated that the waves, which had wavelength ten million times\nthat of the light waves, could be diffracted, refracted and polarised. Thus,\nhe conclusively established the wave nature of the radiation. Further, he\nproduced stationary electromagnetic waves and determined their\nwavelength by measuring the distance between two successive nodes.\nSince the frequency of the wave was known (being equal to the frequency\nof the oscillator), he obtained the speed of the wave using the formula\nv = νλ and found that the waves travelled with the same speed as the\nspeed of light.\n\nThe fact that electromagnetic waves are polarised can be easily seen\nin the response of a portable AM radio to a broadcasting station. If an\nAM radio has a telescopic antenna, it responds to the electric part of the\nsignal. When the antenna is turned horizontal, the signal will be greatly\ndiminished. Some portable radios have horizontal antenna (usually inside\nthe case of radio), which are sensitive to the magnetic component of the\nelectromagnetic wave. Such a radio must remain horizontal in order to\nreceive the signal. In such cases, response also depends on the orientation\nof the radio with respect to the station.\n\nDo electromagnetic waves carry energy and momentum like other\nwaves? Yes, they do. We have seen in chapter 2 that in a region of free\nspace with electric field E, there is an energy density (ε0E\n\n2/2). Similarly,\nas seen in Chapter 6, associated with a magnetic field B is a magnetic\nenergy density (B2/2µ\n\n0\n). As electromagnetic wave contains both electric\n\nand magnetic fields, there is a non-zero energy density associated with\nit. Now consider a plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation of\nthe electromagnetic wave (Fig. 8.4). If there are, on this plane, electric\ncharges, they will be set and sustained in motion by the electric and\nmagnetic fields of the electromagnetic wave. The charges thus acquire\nenergy and momentum from the waves. This just illustrates the fact that\nan electromagnetic wave (like other waves) carries energy and momentum.\nSince it carries momentum, an electromagnetic wave also exerts pressure,\ncalled radiation pressure.\nIf the total energy transferred to a surface in time t is U, it can be shown\nthat the magnitude of the total momentum delivered to this surface (for\ncomplete absorption) is,\n\nU\np\n\nc\n= (8.12)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n278  E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 8\n\n.3\n E\n\nX\nA\n\nM\nP\n\nL\nE\n 8\n\n.2\n\nWhen the sun shines on your hand, you feel the energy being\nabsorbed from the electromagnetic waves (your hands get warm).\nElectromagnetic waves also transfer momentum to your hand but\nbecause c is very large, the amount of momentum transferred is extremely\nsmall and you do not feel the pressure. In 1903, the American scientists\nNicols and Hull succeeded in measuring radiation pressure of\nvisible light and verified Eq. (8.12). It was found to be of the order of\n7 × 10–6 N/m2. Thus, on a surface of area 10 cm2, the force due to radiation\nis only about 7 × 10–9 N.\n\nThe great technological importance of electromagnetic waves stems\nfrom their capability to carry energy from one place to another. The\nradio and TV signals from broadcasting stations carry energy. Light\ncarries energy from the sun to the earth, thus making life possible on\nthe earth.\n\nExample 8.2 A plane electromagnetic wave of frequency\n25 MHz travels in free space along the x-direction.

Therefore, B should be in a direction\nperpendicular to both x- and y-axes. Using vector algebra, E × B should\nbe along  x-direction. Since, (+ ĵ ) × (+ k̂ ) = î , B is along the z-direction.\nThus, B = 2.1 × 10–8 k̂ T\n\nExample 8.3 The magnetic field in a plane electromagnetic wave is\ngiven by B\n\ny\n = (2 × 10–7) T sin (0.5×103x+1.5×1011t).\n\n(a) What is the wavelength and frequency of the wave?\n\n(b) Write an expression for the electric field.\n\nSolution\n\n(a) Comparing the given equation with\n\nB\ny\n = B0 sin \n\n2π\nλ\n\nx t\n\nT\n+\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ef\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8fb\n\uf8fa\n\nWe get, 3\n2\n\n0.5 10\nπ\n\nλ =\n×\n\n m = 1.26 cm,\n\nand   ( )111 1.5 10 /2 23.9 GHz\nT\n\nν= = × π =\n\n(b) E0 = B0c = 2×10\n–7 T × 3 × 108 m/s = 6 × 101 V/m\n\nThe electric field component is perpendicular to the direction of\npropagation and the direction of magnetic field.

The existence\nof ultraviolet and infrared waves was barely established. By the end of the\nnineteenth century, X-rays and gamma rays had also been discovered.  We\nnow know that, electromagnetic waves include visible light waves, X-rays,\ngamma rays, radio waves, microwaves, ultraviolet and infrared waves. The\nclassification of em waves according to frequency is the electromagnetic\nspectrum (Fig. 8.5). There is no sharp division between one kind of wave\nand the next. The classification is based roughly on how the waves are\nproduced and/or detected.\n\nFIGURE 8.5 The electromagnetic spectrum, with common names for various\npart of it.

They are used in radio and television communication systems. They\nare generally in the frequency range from 500 kHz to about 1000 MHz.\nThe AM (amplitude modulated) band is from 530 kHz to 1710 kHz. Higher\nfrequencies upto 54 MHz are used for short wave bands. TV waves range\nfrom 54 MHz to 890 MHz. The FM (frequency modulated) radio band\nextends from 88 MHz to 108 MHz. Cellular phones use radio waves to\ntransmit voice communication in the ultrahigh frequency (UHF) band. How\nthese waves are transmitted and received is described in Chapter 15.\n\n8.4.2  Microwaves\n\nMicrowaves (short-wavelength radio waves), with frequencies in the\ngigahertz (GHz) range, are produced by special vacuum tubes (called\nklystrons, magnetrons and Gunn diodes). Due to their short wavelengths,\nthey are suitable for the radar systems used in aircraft navigation. Radar\nalso provides the basis for the speed guns used to time fast balls, tennis-\nserves, and automobiles. Microwave ovens are an interesting domestic\napplication of these waves. In such ovens, the frequency of the microwaves\nis selected to match the resonant frequency of water molecules so that\nenergy from the waves is transferred efficiently to the kinetic energy of\nthe molecules. This raises the temperature of any food containing water.\n\nMICROWAVE OVEN\n\nThe spectrum of electromagnetic radiation contains a part known as microwaves. These\nwaves have frequency and energy smaller than visible light and wavelength larger than it.\nWhat is the principle of a microwave oven and how does it work?\n\nOur objective is to cook food or warm it up. All food items such as fruit, vegetables,\nmeat, cereals, etc., contain water as a constituent. Now, what does it mean when we say that\na certain object has become warmer? When the temperature of a body rises, the energy of\nthe random motion of atoms and molecules increases and the molecules travel or vibrate or\nrotate with higher energies. The frequency of rotation of water molecules is about\n2.45 gigahertz (GHz). If water receives microwaves of this frequency, its molecules absorb\nthis radiation, which is equivalent to heating up water. These molecules share this energy\nwith neighbouring food molecules, heating up the food.\n\nOne should use porcelain vessels and not metal containers in a microwave oven because\nof the danger of getting a shock from accumulated electric charges. Metals may also melt\nfrom heating. The porcelain container remains unaffected and cool, because its large\nmolecules vibrate and rotate with much smaller frequencies, and thus cannot absorb\nmicrowaves. Hence, they do not get heated up.\n\nThus, the basic principle of a microwave oven is to generate microwave radiation of\nappropriate frequency in the working space of the oven where we keep food. This way\nenergy is not wasted in heating up the vessel. In the conventional heating method, the vessel\non the burner gets heated first, and then the food inside gets heated because of transfer of\nenergy from the vessel. In the microwave oven, on the other hand, energy is directly  delivered\nto water molecules which is shared by the entire food.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n282\n\n8.4.3 Infrared waves\n\nInfrared waves are produced by hot bodies and molecules. This band\nlies adjacent to the low-frequency or long-wave length end of the visible\nspectrum. Infrared waves are sometimes referred to as heat waves. This\nis because water molecules present in most materials readily absorb\ninfrared waves (many other molecules, for example, CO\n\n2\n, NH\n\n3\n, also absorb\n\ninfrared waves). After absorption, their thermal motion increases, that is,\nthey heat up and heat their surroundings. Infrared lamps are used in\nphysical therapy. Infrared radiation also plays an important role in\nmaintaining the earth’s warmth or average temperature through the\ngreenhouse effect. Incoming visible light (which passes relatively easily\nthrough the atmosphere) is absorbed by the earth’s surface and re-\nradiated as infrared (longer wavelength) radiations. This radiation is\ntrapped by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and water vapour.\nInfrared detectors are used in Earth satellites, both for military purposes\nand to observe growth of crops. Electronic devices (for example\nsemiconductor light emitting diodes) also   emit infrared and are widely\nused in the remote switches of household electronic systems such as TV\nsets, video recorders and hi-fi systems.\n\n8.4.4 Visible rays\n\nIt is the most familiar form of electromagnetic waves. It is the part of the\nspectrum that is detected by the human eye. It runs from about\n4 × 1014 Hz to about 7 × 1014 Hz or a wavelength range of about 700 –\n400 nm. Visible light emitted or reflected from objects around us provides\nus information about the world. Our eyes are sensitive to this range of\nwavelengths. Different animals are sensitive to different range of\nwavelengths. For example, snakes can detect infrared waves, and the\n‘visible’ range of many insects extends well into the utraviolet.\n\n8.4.5 Ultraviolet rays\n\nIt covers wavelengths ranging from about 4 × 10–7 m (400 nm) down to\n6 × 10–10m (0.6 nm). Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is produced by special\nlamps and very hot bodies. The sun is an important source of ultraviolet\nlight. But fortunately, most of it is absorbed in the ozone layer in the\natmosphere at an altitude of about 40 – 50 km. UV light in large quantities\nhas harmful effects on humans. Exposure to UV radiation induces the\nproduction of more melanin, causing tanning of the skin. UV radiation is\nabsorbed by ordinary glass. Hence, one cannot get tanned or sunburn\nthrough glass windows.\n\nWelders wear special glass goggles or face masks with glass windows\nto protect their eyes from large amount of UV produced by welding arcs.\nDue to its  shorter wavelengths, UV radiations  can be focussed into very\nnarrow beams for high precision applications such as  LASIK (Laser-\nassisted in situ keratomileusis) eye surgery. UV lamps are used to kill\ngerms  in water purifiers.\n\nOzone layer in the atmosphere plays a protective role, and hence its\ndepletion by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) gas (such as freon) is a matter\nof international concern.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n283\n\nElectromagnetic\n\nWaves\n\n8.4.6 X-rays\n\nBeyond the UV region of the electromagnetic spectrum lies the X-ray\nregion. We are familiar with X-rays because of its medical applications. It\ncovers wavelengths from about 10–8 m (10 nm) down to 10–13 m\n(10–4 nm). One common way to generate X-rays is to bombard a metal\ntarget by high energy electrons. X-rays are used as a diagnostic tool in\nmedicine and as a treatment for certain forms of cancer. Because X-rays\ndamage or destroy living tissues and organisms, care must be taken to\navoid unnecessary or over exposure.\n\n8.4.7 Gamma rays\n\nThey lie in the upper frequency range of the electromagnetic spectrum\nand have wavelengths of from about 10–10m to less than 10–14m. This\nhigh frequency radiation is produced in nuclear reactions and\nalso emitted by radioactive nuclei. They are used in medicine to destroy\ncancer cells.\n\nTable 8.1 summarises different types of electromagnetic waves, their\nproduction and detections. As mentioned earlier, the demarcation\nbetween different regions is not sharp and there are overlaps.\n\nTABLE 8.1 DIFFERENT TYPES OF ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES\n\nType Wavelength range Production Detection\n\nRadio > 0.1 m Rapid  acceleration and Receiver’s aerials\ndecelerations of electrons\nin aerials\n\nMicrowave 0.1m to 1 mm Klystron valve or Point contact diodes\nmagnetron valve\n\nInfra-red 1mm to 700 nm Vibration of atoms Thermopiles\nand molecules Bolometer, Infrared\n\nphotographic film\n\nLight 700 nm to 400 nm Electrons in atoms emit The eye\nlight when they move from Photocells\none energy level to a Photographic film\nlower energy level\n\nUltraviolet 400 nm to 1nm Inner shell electrons in Photocells\natoms moving from one Photographic film\nenergy level  to a lower level\n\nX-rays 1nm to 10–3 nm X-ray tubes or inner shell Photographic film\nelectrons Geiger tubes\n\nIonisation chamber\n\nGamma rays  <10–3 nm Radioactive decay of the -do-\nnucleus\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n284\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. Maxwell found an inconsistency in the Ampere’s law and suggested the\nexistence of an additional current, called displacement current, to remove\nthis inconsistency. This displacement current is due to time-varying electric\nfield and is given by\n\n0\nd\ndd\n\ni\nt\n\nΦ\nε Ε=\n\nand acts as a source of magnetic field in exactly the same way as conduction\ncurrent.\n\n2. An accelerating charge produces electromagnetic waves. An electric charge\noscillating harmonically with frequency ν, produces electromagnetic waves\nof the same frequency ν. An electric dipole is a basic source of\nelectromagnetic waves.\n\n3. Electromagnetic waves with wavelength of the order of a few metres were\nfirst produced and detected in the laboratory by Hertz in 1887. He thus\nverified a basic prediction of Maxwell’s equations.\n\n4. Electric and magnetic fields oscillate sinusoidally in space and time in an\nelectromagnetic wave. The oscillating electric and magnetic fields, E and\nB are perpendicular to each other, and to the direction of propagation of\nthe electromagnetic wave. For a wave of frequency ν, wavelength λ,\npropagating along z-direction, we have\n\nE\n \n = E\n\nx\n (t) = E0 sin (kz – ω t )\n\n   = E0 sin    \n2 20π π\n\nz\nt E\n\nz t\n\nTλ\nν\n\nλ\n−\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ef\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8fb\n\uf8fa = −\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ef\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8fb\n\uf8fasin\n\nB = B\ny\n(t) = B\n\n0\n sin (kz – ω t)\n\n   = B\nz\n\nt B\nz t\n\nT\n0 02 2sin sinπ π\n\nλ\nν\n\nλ\n−\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ef\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8fb\n\uf8fa = −\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ef\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8fb\n\uf8fa\n\nThey are related by E0/B0 = c.\n\n5. The speed c of electromagnetic wave in vacuum is related to µ\n0\n and ε\n\n0\n (the\n\nfree space permeability and permittivity constants) as follows:\n\n0 01/c µ ε= . The value of c equals the speed of light obtained from\n\noptical measurements.\n\nLight is an electromagnetic wave; c is, therefore, also the speed of light.\nElectromagnetic waves other than light also have the same velocity c in\nfree space.\n\nThe speed of light, or of electromagnetic waves in a material medium is\n\ngiven by 1/v µ ε=\n\nwhere µ is the permeability of the medium and ε its permittivity.\n6. Electromagnetic waves carry energy as they travel through space and this\n\nenergy is shared equally by the electric and magnetic fields.\n\nElectromagnetic waves transport momentum as well. When these waves\nstrike a surface, a pressure is exerted on the surface. If total energy\ntransferred to a surface in time t is U, total momentum delivered to this\nsurface is p = U/c.\n\n7. The spectrum of electromagnetic waves stretches, in principle, over an\ninfinite range of wavelengths. Different regions are known by different\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n285\n\nElectromagnetic\n\nWaves\n\nnames; γ-rays, X-rays, ultraviolet rays, visible rays, infrared rays,\nmicrowaves and radio waves in order of increasing wavelength  from 10–2 Å\nor 10–12 m to 106 m.\n\nThey interact with matter via their electric and magnetic fields which set\nin oscillation charges present in all matter. The detailed interaction and\nso the mechanism of absorption, scattering, etc., depend on the wavelength\nof the electromagnetic wave, and the nature of the atoms and molecules\nin the medium.\n\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n\n1. The basic difference between various types of electromagnetic waves\nlies in their wavelengths or frequencies since all of them travel through\nvacuum with the same speed. Consequently, the waves differ\nconsiderably in their mode of interaction with matter.\n\n2. Accelerated charged particles radiate electromagnetic waves. The\nwavelength of the electromagnetic wave is often correlated with the\ncharacteristic size of the system that radiates. Thus, gamma radiation,\nhaving wavelength of 10–14 m to 10–15 m, typically originate from an\natomic nucleus. X-rays are emitted from heavy atoms. Radio waves\nare produced by accelerating electrons in a circuit. A transmitting\nantenna can most efficiently radiate waves having a wavelength of\nabout the same size as the antenna. Visible radiation emitted by atoms\nis, however, much longer in wavelength than atomic size.\n\n3. The oscillating fields of an electromagnetic wave can accelerate charges\nand can produce oscillating currents. Therefore, an apparatus designed\nto detect electromagnetic waves is based on this fact. Hertz original\n‘receiver’ worked in exactly this way. The same basic principle is utilised\nin practically all modern receiving devices. High frequency\nelectromagnetic waves are detected by other means based on the\nphysical effects they produce on interacting with matter.\n\n4. Infrared waves, with frequencies lower than those of visible light,\nvibrate not only the electrons, but entire atoms or molecules of a\nsubstance. This vibration increases the internal energy and\nconsequently, the temperature of the substance. This is why infrared\nwaves are often called heat waves.\n\n5. The centre of sensitivity of our eyes coincides with the centre of the\nwavelength distribution of the sun. It is because humans have evolved\nwith visions most sensitive to the strongest wavelengths from\nthe sun.\n\nEXERCISES\n\n8.1 Figure 8.6 shows a capacitor made of two circular plates each of\nradius 12 cm, and separated by 5.0 cm.
