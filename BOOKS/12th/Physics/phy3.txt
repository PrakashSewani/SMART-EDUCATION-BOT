Charges in motion constitute an electric current. Such currents occur\n\nnaturally in many situations. Lightning is one such phenomenon in\n\nwhich charges flow from the clouds to the earth through the atmosphere,\n\nsometimes with disastrous results. The flow of charges in lightning is not\n\nsteady, but in our everyday life we see many devices where charges flow\n\nin a steady manner, like water flowing smoothly in a river. A torch and a\n\ncell-driven clock are examples of such devices. In the present chapter, we\n\nshall study some of the basic laws concerning steady electric currents.\n\n3.2  ELECTRIC CURRENT\nImagine a small area held normal to the direction of flow of charges. Both\n\nthe positive and the negative charges may flow forward and backward\n\nacross the area. In a given time interval t, let q\n+\n be the net amount (i.e.,\n\nforward minus backward) of positive charge that flows in the forward\n\ndirection across the area. Similarly, let q\n–\n be the net amount of negative\n\ncharge flowing across the area in the forward direction. The net amount\n\nof charge flowing across the area in the forward direction in the time\n\ninterval t, then, is q = q\n+\n– q\n\n–\n. This is proportional to t for steady current\n\nChapter Three\n\nCURRENT\n\nELECTRICITY\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n94\n\nand the quotient\n\nq\nI\n\nt\n= (3.1)\n\nis defined to be the current across the area in the forward direction. (If it\nturn out to be a negative number, it implies a current in the backward\ndirection.)\n\nCurrents are not always steady and hence more generally, we define\nthe current as follows. Let ∆Q be the net charge flowing across a cross-\nsection of a conductor during the time interval ∆t [i.e., between times t\nand (t + ∆t)]. Then, the current at time t across the cross-section of the\nconductor is defined as the value of the ratio of ∆Q to ∆t in the limit of ∆t\ntending to zero,\n\n( )\n0\n\nlim\nt\n\nQ\nI t\n\nt∆ →\n\n∆\n≡\n\n∆\n(3.2)\n\nIn SI units, the unit of current is ampere. An ampere is defined\nthrough magnetic effects of currents that we will study in the following\nchapter. An ampere is typically the order of magnitude of currents in\n\ndomestic appliances. An average lightning carries currents of the order\nof tens of thousands of amperes and at the other extreme, currents in\nour nerves are in microamperes.\n\n3.3 ELECTRIC CURRENTS IN CONDUCTORS\nAn electric charge will experience a force if an electric field is applied. If it is\nfree to move, it will thus move contributing to a current. In nature, free\n\ncharged particles do exist like in upper strata of atmosphere called the\nionosphere. However, in atoms and molecules, the negatively charged\nelectrons and the positively charged nuclei are bound to each other and\n\nare thus not free to move. Bulk matter is made up of many molecules, a\ngram of water, for example, contains approximately 10\n\n22\n molecules. These\n\nmolecules are so closely packed that the electrons are no longer attached\n\nto individual nuclei. In some materials, the electrons will still be bound,\ni.e., they will not accelerate even if an electric field is applied. In other\nmaterials, notably metals, some of the electrons are practically free to move\n\nwithin the bulk material. These materials, generally called conductors,\ndevelop electric currents in them when an electric field is applied.\n\nIf we consider solid conductors, then of course the atoms are tightly\nbound to each other so that the current is carried by the negatively\ncharged electrons. There are, however, other types of conductors like\nelectrolytic solutions where positive and negative charges both can move.\nIn our discussions, we will focus only on solid conductors so that the\ncurrent is carried by the negatively charged electrons in the background\nof fixed positive ions.\n\nConsider first the case when no electric field is present. The electrons\nwill be moving due to thermal motion during which they collide with the\nfixed ions. An electron colliding with an ion emerges with the same speed\n\nas before the collision. However, the direction of its velocity after the\ncollision is completely random. At a given time, there is no preferential\ndirection for the velocities of the electrons. Thus on the average, the\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nCurrent\n\nElectricity\n\n95\n\nnumber of electrons travelling in any direction will be equal to the number\nof electrons travelling in the opposite direction. So, there will be no net\n\nelectric current.\nLet us now see what happens to such a\n\npiece of conductor if an electric field is applied.\n\nTo focus our thoughts, imagine the conductor\nin the shape of a cylinder of radius R (Fig. 3.1).\nSuppose we now take two thin circular discs\n\nof a dielectric of the same radius and put\npositive charge +Q distributed over one disc\nand similarly –Q at the other disc. We attach\n\nthe two discs on the two flat surfaces of the\ncylinder. An electric field will be created and\nis directed from the positive towards the\n\nnegative charge. The electrons will be accelerated due to this field towards\n+Q. They will thus move to neutralise the charges. The electrons, as long\nas they are moving, will constitute an electric current. Hence in the\n\nsituation considered, there will be a current for a very short while and no\ncurrent thereafter.\n\nWe can also imagine a mechanism where the ends of the cylinder are\n\nsupplied with fresh charges to make up for any charges neutralised by\nelectrons moving inside the conductor. In that case, there will be a steady\nelectric field in the body of the conductor. This will result in a continuous\n\ncurrent rather than a current for a short period of time. Mechanisms,\nwhich maintain a steady electric field are cells or batteries that we shall\nstudy  later in this chapter. In the next sections, we shall study the steady\n\ncurrent that results from a steady electric field in conductors.\n\n3.4  OHM’S LAW\nA basic law regarding flow of currents was discovered by G.S. Ohm in\n\n1828, long before the physical mechanism responsible for flow of currents\nwas discovered. Imagine a conductor through which a current I is flowing\nand let V be the potential difference between the ends of the conductor.\n\nThen Ohm’s law states that\n\n     V ∝ I\n\nor, V = R I (3.3)\n\nwhere the constant of proportionality R is called the resistance of the\n\nconductor. The SI units of resistance is ohm, and is denoted by the symbol\n\nΩ. The resistance R not only depends on the material of the conductor\nbut also on the dimensions of the conductor. The dependence of R on the\n\ndimensions of the conductor can easily be determined as follows.\n\nConsider a conductor satisfying Eq. (3.3) to be in the form of a slab of\nlength l and cross sectional area A [Fig. 3.2(a)]. Imagine placing two such\nidentical slabs side by side [Fig. 3.2(b)], so that the length of the\n\ncombination is 2l. The current flowing through the  combination is the\nsame as that flowing through either of the slabs. If V is the potential\ndifference across the ends of the first slab, then V is also the potential\n\ndifference across the ends of the second slab since the second slab is\n\nFIGURE 3.1 Charges +Q and –Q put at the ends\nof a metallic cylinder. The electrons will drift\n\nbecause of the electric field created to\n\nneutralise the charges. The current thus\nwill stop after a while unless the charges +Q\n\nand –Q are continuously replenished.\n\nFIGURE 3.2\nIllustrating the\n\nrelation R = ρl/A for\na rectangular slab\nof length l and area\n\nof cross-section A.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n96\n\nidentical to the first and the same current I flows through\nboth. The potential difference across the ends of the\n\ncombination is clearly sum of the potential difference\nacross the two individual slabs and hence equals 2V. The\ncurrent through the combination is I and the resistance\n\nof the combination R\nC\n is [from Eq. (3.3)],\n\n2\n2C\n\nV\nR R\n\nI\n= = (3.4)\n\nsince V/I = R, the resistance of either of the slabs. Thus,\n\ndoubling the length of a conductor doubles the\nresistance. In general, then resistance is proportional to\nlength,\n\nR l∝ (3.5)\nNext, imagine dividing the slab into two by cutting it\n\nlengthwise so that the slab can be considered as a\n\ncombination of two identical slabs of length l , but each\nhaving a cross sectional  area of A/2 [Fig. 3.2(c)].\n\nFor a given voltage V across the slab, if I is the current\n\nthrough the entire slab, then clearly the current flowing\nthrough each of the two half-slabs is I/2. Since the\npotential difference across the ends of the half-slabs is V,\n\ni.e., the same as across the full slab, the resistance of each\nof the half-slabs R\n\n1\n is\n\n1 2 2 .\n( /2)\n\nV V\nR R\n\nI I\n= = = (3.6)\n\nThus, halving the area of the cross-section of a conductor doubles\nthe resistance. In general, then the resistance R is inversely proportional\nto the cross-sectional area,\n\n1\nR\n\nA\n∝ (3.7)\n\nCombining Eqs. (3.5) and (3.7), we have\n\nl\nR\n\nA\n∝ (3.8)\n\nand hence for a given conductor\n\nl\nR\n\nA\nρ= (3.9)\n\nwhere the constant of proportionality ρ depends on the material of the\nconductor but not on its dimensions. ρ is called resistivity.\n\nUsing the last equation, Ohm’s law reads\n\nI l\nV I R\n\nA\n\nρ\n= × = (3.10)\n\nCurrent per unit area (taken normal to the current), I/A, is called\ncurrent density and is denoted by j. The SI units of the current density\n\nare A/m\n2\n. Further, if E is the magnitude of uniform electric field in the\n\nconductor whose length is l, then the potential difference V across its\nends is El. Using these, the last equation reads\n\nG\nE\n\nO\nR\n\nG\n S\n\nIM\nO\n\nN\n O\n\nH\nM\n\n (\n1\n7\n8\n7\n–\n1\n\n8\n5\n4\n)\n\nGeorg Simon Ohm  (1787–\n\n1854) German physicist,\nprofessor at Munich. Ohm\nwas led to his law by an\n\nanalogy between the\nconduction of heat: the\nelectric field is analogous to\n\nthe temperature gradient,\nand the electric current is\nanalogous to the heat flow.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nCurrent\n\nElectricity\n\n97\n\n        E l = j ρ l\n\nor,    E = j ρ (3.11)\nThe above relation for magnitudes E and j can indeed be cast in a\n\nvector  form. The current density, (which we have defined as the current\nthrough unit area normal to the current) is also directed along E, and is\n\nalso a vector j (≡≡≡≡≡ j E/E). Thus, the last equation can be written as,\n        E = jρ (3.12)\n\nor,   j = σ E (3.13)\nwhere σ ≡1/ρ is called the conductivity. Ohm’s law is often stated in an\nequivalent form, Eq. (3.13) in addition to Eq.(3.3). In the next section, we\nwill try to understand the origin of the Ohm’s law as arising from the\n\ncharacteristics of the drift of electrons.\n\n3.5 DRIFT OF ELECTRONS AND THE ORIGIN\nOF RESISTIVITY\n\nAs remarked before, an electron will suffer collisions with the heavy fixed\nions, but after collision, it will emerge with the same speed but in random\ndirections. If we consider all the electrons, their average velocity will be\n\nzero since their directions are random. Thus, if there are N electrons and\nthe velocity of the i\n\nth\n electron (i = 1, 2, 3, ... N ) at a given time is v\n\ni\n, then\n\n1\n0\n\n1N\ni\n\ni\n\nv =\n=\n∑\nN\n\n(3.14)\n\nConsider now the situation when an electric field is\n\npresent. Electrons will be accelerated due to this\nfield by\n\n=\n– E\n\na\ne\n\nm\n(3.15)\n\nwhere –e is the charge and m is the mass of an electron.\nConsider again the i\n\nth\n electron at a given time t. This\n\nelectron would have had its last collision some time\n\nbefore t, and let t\ni\n be the time elapsed after its last\n\ncollision. If v\ni\n was its velocity immediately after the last\n\ncollision, then its velocity V\ni\n at time t is\n\n−  = +     \nE\n\nV v\ni i i\n\ne\nt\n\nm\n(3.16)\n\nsince starting with its last collision it was accelerated\n(Fig. 3.3) with an acceleration given by Eq. (3.15) for a\ntime interval t\n\ni\n. The average velocity of the electrons at\n\ntime t is the average of all the V\ni\n’s. The average of v\n\ni\n’s is\n\nzero [Eq. (3.14)] since immediately after any collision,\nthe direction of the velocity of an electron is completely\n\nrandom. The collisions of the electrons do not occur at\nregular intervals but at random times. Let us denote by\nτ, the average time between successive collisions. Then\nat a given time, some of the electrons would have spent\n\nFIGURE 3.3 A schematic picture of\n\nan electron moving from a point A to\nanother point B through repeated\ncollisions, and straight line travel\n\nbetween collisions (full lines). If an\nelectric field is applied as shown, the\nelectron ends up at point B′ (dotted\nlines). A slight drift in a direction\n\nopposite the electric field is visible.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n98\n\ntime more than τ and some less than τ. In other words, the time t\ni\n in\n\nEq. (3.16) will be less than τ for some and more than τ for others as we go\nthrough the values of i = 1, 2 ..... N. The average value of t\n\ni\n then is τ\n\n(known as relaxation time). Thus, averaging Eq. (3.16) over the\nN-electrons at any given time t gives us for the average velocity v\n\nd\n\n( ) ( ) ( )≡ = − Ev V vd i i iaverage average average\ne\n\nt\nm\n\n0 – τ τ= = −\nE Ee e\n\nm m\n(3.17)\n\nThis last result is surprising. It tells us that the\n\nelectrons move with an average velocity which is\nindependent of time, although electrons are\naccelerated. This is the phenomenon of drift and the\n\nvelocity v\nd\n in Eq. (3.17) is called the drift velocity.\n\nBecause of the drift, there will be net transport of\ncharges across any area perpendicular to E. Consider\n\na planar area A, located inside the conductor such that\nthe normal to the area is parallel to E (Fig. 3.4). Then\nbecause of the drift, in an infinitesimal amount of time\n\n∆t, all electrons to the left of the area at distances upto\n|v\n\nd\n|∆t would have crossed the area. If n is the number\n\nof free electrons per unit volume in the metal, then\n\nthere are n ∆t |v\nd\n|A such electrons. Since each\n\nelectron carries a charge –e, the total charge transported across this area\nA to the right in time ∆t is –ne A|v\n\nd\n|∆t. E is directed towards the left and\n\nhence the total charge transported along E across the area is negative of\nthis. The amount of charge crossing the area A in time ∆t is by definition\n[Eq. (3.2)] I ∆t, where I is the magnitude of the current. Hence,\n\nv∆ = + ∆dI t n e A t (3.18)\n\nSubstituting the value of |v\nd\n| from Eq. (3.17)\n\n2\n\nEτ∆ = ∆\ne A\n\nI t n t\nm\n\n(3.19)\n\nBy definition I is related to the magnitude |j| of the current density by\n\nI = |j|A (3.20)\n\nHence, from Eqs.(3.19) and (3.20),\n\n2\n\nj Eτ=\nne\n\nm\n(3.21)\n\nThe vector j is parallel to E and hence we can write Eq. (3.21) in the\n\nvector form\n\n2\n\nτ=j E\nne\n\nm\n(3.22)\n\nComparison with Eq. (3.13) shows that Eq. (3.22) is exactly the Ohm’s\nlaw, if we identify the conductivity σ  as\n\nFIGURE 3.4 Current in a metallic\n\nconductor. The magnitude of current\ndensity in a metal is the magnitude of\ncharge contained in a cylinder of unit\n\narea and length v\nd\n.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nCurrent\n\nElectricity\n\n99\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 3\n\n.1\n\n2\nne\n\nm\nσ τ= (3.23)\n\nWe thus see that a very simple picture of electrical conduction\nreproduces Ohm’s law. We have, of course, made assumptions that τ\nand n are constants, independent of E. We shall, in the next section,\ndiscuss the limitations of Ohm’s law.\n\nExample 3.1 (a) Estimate the average drift speed of conduction\nelectrons in a copper wire of cross-sectional area 1.0 × 10\n\n–7\n m\n\n2 \ncarrying\n\na current of 1.5 A. Assume that each copper atom contributes roughly\n\none conduction electron. The density of copper is 9.0 × 10\n3 \n\nkg/m\n3\n,\n\nand its atomic mass is 63.5 u. (b) Compare the drift speed obtained\nabove with, (i) thermal speeds of copper atoms at ordinary\n\ntemperatures, (ii) speed of propagation of electric field along the\nconductor which causes the drift motion.\n\nSolution\n\n(a) The direction of drift velocity of conduction electrons is opposite\nto the electric field direction, i.e., electrons drift in the direction\nof increasing potential. The drift speed v\n\nd\n is given by Eq. (3.18)\n\nv\nd\n  = (I/neA)\n\nNow, e = 1.6 × 10\n–19\n\n C, A = 1.0 × 10\n–7\n\nm\n2\n, I = 1.5 A. The density of\n\nconduction electrons, n is equal to the number of atoms per cubic\n\nmetre (assuming one conduction electron per Cu atom as is\nreasonable from its valence electron count of one). A cubic metre\nof copper has a mass of 9.0 × 103 kg. Since 6.0 × 1023 copper\n\natoms have a mass of 63.5 g,\n\n23\n66.0 10\n\n9.0 10\n63.5\n\nn\n×\n\n= × ×\n\n   = 8.5 × 10\n28\n\n m\n–3\n\nwhich gives,\n\n28 –19 –7\n\n1.5\n\n8.5 10 1.6 10 1.0 10\n=\n\n× × × × ×d\nv\n\n    = 1.1 × 10–3 m s–1  = 1.1 mm s–1\n\n(b) (i) At a temperature T, the thermal speed* of a copper atom of\n\nmass M is obtained from [<(1/2) Mv\n2\n > = (3/2) k\n\nB\nT ] and is thus\n\ntypically of the order of /Bk T M , where kB is the Boltzmann\n\nconstant. For copper at 300 K, this is about 2 × 10\n2\n m/s. This\n\nfigure indicates the random vibrational speeds of copper atoms\nin a conductor. Note that the drift speed of electrons is much\n\nsmaller, about 10\n–5\n\n times the typical thermal speed at ordinary\ntemperatures.\n(ii) An electric field travelling along the conductor has a speed of\n\nan electromagnetic wave, namely equal to 3.0 × 10\n8\n m s\n\n–1\n\n(You will learn about this in Chapter 8). The drift speed is, in\n\ncomparison, extremely small; smaller by a factor of 10\n–11\n\n.\n\n* See Eq. (13.23) of Chapter 13 from Class XI book.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n100\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 3\n\n.2\n\nExample 3.2\n\n(a) In Example 3.1, the electron drift speed is estimated to be only a\nfew mm s\n\n–1\n for currents in the range of a few amperes? How then\n\nis current established almost the instant a circuit is closed?\n\n(b) The electron drift arises due to the force experienced by electrons\nin the electric field inside the conductor. But force should cause\nacceleration. Why then do the electrons acquire a steady average\n\ndrift speed?\n(c) If the electron drift speed is so small, and the electron’s charge is\n\nsmall, how can we still obtain large amounts of current in a\n\nconductor?\n(d) When electrons drift in a metal from lower to higher potential,\n\ndoes it mean that all the ‘free’ electrons of the metal are moving\n\nin the same direction?\n(e) Are the paths of electrons straight lines between successive\n\ncollisions (with the positive ions of the metal) in the (i) absence of\n\nelectric field, (ii) presence of electric field?\n\nSolution\n(a) Electric field is established throughout the circuit, almost instantly\n\n(with the speed of light) causing at every point a local electron\ndrift. Establishment of a current does not have to wait for electrons\nfrom one end of the conductor travelling to the other end. However,\n\nit does take a little while for the current to reach its steady value.\n(b) Each ‘free’ electron does accelerate, increasing its drift speed until\n\nit collides with a positive ion of the metal. It loses its drift speed\n\nafter collision but starts to accelerate and increases its drift speed\nagain only to suffer a collision again and so on. On the average,\ntherefore, electrons acquire only a drift speed.\n\n(c) Simple, because the electron number density is enormous,\n~10\n\n29\n m\n\n–3\n.\n\n(d) By no means. The drift velocity is superposed over the large\n\nrandom velocities of electrons.\n(e) In the absence of electric field, the paths are straight lines; in the\n\npresence of electric field, the paths are, in general, curved.\n\n3.5.1  Mobility\n\nAs we have seen, conductivity arises from mobile charge carriers. In\n\nmetals, these mobile charge carriers are electrons; in an ionised gas, they\nare electrons and positive charged ions; in an electrolyte, these can be\nboth positive and negative ions.\n\nAn important quantity is the mobility µ defined as the magnitude of\nthe drift velocity per unit electric field:\n\n| |d\n\nE\nµ =\n\nv\n(3.24)\n\nThe SI unit of mobility is m2/Vs and is 104 of the mobility in practical\n\nunits (cm\n2\n/Vs). Mobility is positive. From Eq. (3.17), we have\n\nv\nd\n = \n\nτe E\nm\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nCurrent\n\nElectricity\n\n101\n\nHence,\n\nτ\nµ = =d\n\nv e\n\nE m\n(3.25)\n\nwhere τ is the average collision time for electrons.\n\n3.6  LIMITATIONS OF OHM’S LAW\nAlthough Ohm’s law has been found valid over a large class\n\nof materials, there do exist materials and devices used in\nelectric circuits where the proportionality of V and I does not\nhold. The deviations broadly are one or more of the following\n\ntypes:\n(a) V ceases to be proportional to I (Fig. 3.5).\n(b) The relation between V and I depends on the sign of V. In\n\nother words, if I is the current for a certain V, then reversing\nthe direction of V keeping its magnitude fixed, does not\nproduce a current of the same magnitude as I in the opposite direction\n\n(Fig. 3.6). This happens, for example, in a diode which we will study\nin Chapter 14.\n\n(c) The relation between V and I is not unique, i.e., there is more than\n\none value of V for the same current I (Fig. 3.7). A material exhibiting\nsuch behaviour is GaAs.\nMaterials and devices not obeying Ohm’s law in the form of Eq. (3.3)\n\nare actually widely used in electronic circuits. In this and a few\nsubsequent chapters, however, we will study the electrical currents in\nmaterials that obey Ohm’s law.\n\n3.7  RESISTIVITY OF VARIOUS MATERIALS\nThe resistivities of various common materials are listed in Table 3.1. The\nmaterials are classified as conductors, semiconductors and insulators\n\nFIGURE 3.5 The dashed line\nrepresents the linear Ohm’s\n\nlaw. The solid line is the voltage\n\nV versus current I for a good\nconductor.\n\nFIGURE 3.6 Characteristic curve\nof a diode.

At the\nother end are insulators like ceramic, rubber and plastics having\n\nresistivities 10\n18\n\n times greater than metals or more. In between the two\n\nare the semiconductors. These, however, have resistivities\n\ncharacteristically decreasing with a rise in temperature. The resistivities\n\nof semiconductors can be decreased by adding small amount of suitable\n\nimpurities. This last feature is exploited in use of semiconductors for\n\nelectronic devices.\n\nTABLE 3.1 RESISTIVITIES OF SOME MATERIALS\n\nMaterial Resistivity, ρ Temperature coefficient\n(Ω m) at 0°C of resistivity, α (°C) –1\n\n1 d\n   at  0 C\n\nd\n\nρ\nρ\n\n  °    T\n\nConductors\n\nSilver 1.6 × 10\n–8\n\n0.0041\nCopper 1.7 × 10\n\n–8\n0.0068\n\nAluminium 2.7 × 10–8 0.0043\n\nTungsten 5.6 × 10\n–8\n\n0.0045\nIron 10 × 10\n\n–8\n0.0065\n\nPlatinum 11 × 10\n–8\n\n0.0039\n\nMercury 98 × 10\n–8\n\n0.0009\nNichrome ~100 × 10\n\n–8\n0.0004\n\n(alloy of Ni, Fe, Cr)\n\nManganin (alloy) 48 × 10\n–8\n\n0.002 × 10\n–3\n\nSemiconductors\n\nCarbon (graphite) 3.5 × 10\n–5\n\n– 0.0005\nGermanium 0.46 – 0.05\nSilicon 2300 – 0.07\n\nInsulators\n\nPure Water 2.5 × 10\n5\n\nGlass 10\n10\n\n – 10\n14\n\nHard Rubber 10\n13\n\n – 10\n16\n\nNaCl ~10\n14\n\nFused Quartz ~10\n16\n\nCommercially produced resistors for domestic use or in laboratories\n\nare of two major types: wire bound resistors and carbon resistors. Wire\n\nbound resistors are made by winding the wires of an alloy, viz., manganin,\n\nconstantan, nichrome or similar ones. The choice of these materials is\n\ndictated mostly by the fact that their resistivities are relatively insensitive\n\nto temperature. These resistances are typically in the range of a fraction\n\nof an ohm to a few hundred ohms.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nCurrent\n\nElectricity\n\n103\n\nResistors in the higher range are made mostly from carbon. Carbon\nresistors are compact, inexpensive and thus find extensive use in electronic\n\ncircuits. Carbon resistors are small in size and hence their values are\ngiven using a colour code.\n\nTABLE 3.2 RESISTOR COLOUR CODES\n\nColour Number Multiplier Tolerance (%)\n\nBlack 0 1\n\nBrown 1 10\n1\n\nRed 2 102\n\nOrange 3 10\n3\n\nYellow 4 10\n4\n\nGreen 5 10\n5\n\nBlue 6 10\n6\n\nViolet 7 107\n\nGray 8 10\n8\n\nWhite 9 109\n\nGold 10\n–1\n\n5\n\nSilver 10\n–2\n\n10\n\nNo colour 20\n\nThe resistors have a set of co-axial coloured rings\n\non them whose significance are listed in Table 3.2.

The last band stands for tolerance or possible\n\nvariation in percentage about the indicated values.\n\nSometimes, this last band is absent and that indicates\na tolerance of 20% (Fig. 3.8). For example, if the four\n\ncolours are orange, blue, yellow and gold, the resistance\n\nvalue is 36 × 10\n4\n Ω, with a tolerence value of 5%.\n\n3.8 TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE OF\nRESISTIVITY\n\nThe resistivity of a material is found to be dependent on\nthe temperature. Different materials do not exhibit the\n\nsame dependence on temperatures. Over a limited range\nof temperatures, that is not too large, the resistivity of a\nmetallic conductor is approximately given by,\n\nρ\nT\n = ρ\n\n0\n [1 + α (T–T\n\n0\n)] (3.26)\n\nwhere ρ\nT\n is the resistivity at a temperature T and ρ\n\n0\n is the same at a\n\nreference temperature T\n0\n. α is called the temperature co-efficient of\n\nresistivity, and from Eq. (3.26), the dimension of α is (Temperature)–1.\n\nFIGURE 3.8 Colour coded resistors\n(a) (22 × 10\n\n2\n Ω) ± 10%,\n\n(b) (47 × 10 Ω) ± 5%.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n104\n\nFor  metals, α is positive and values of α for some metals at  T\n0\n = 0°C are\n\nlisted in Table 3.1.\n\nThe relation of Eq. (3.26) implies that a graph of ρ\nT\n plotted against T\n\nwould be a straight line. At temperatures much lower than 0°C, the graph,\n\nhowever, deviates considerably from a straight line (Fig. 3.9).\n\nEquation (3.26) thus, can be used approximately over a limited range\nof T around any reference temperature T\n\n0\n, where the graph can be\n\napproximated as a straight line.\n\nSome materials like Nichrome (which is an alloy of nickel, iron and\n\nchromium) exhibit a very weak dependence of resistivity with temperature\n\n(Fig. 3.10). Manganin and constantan have similar properties. These\n\nmaterials are thus widely used in wire bound standard resistors since\n\ntheir resistance values would change very little with temperatures.\n\nUnlike metals, the resistivities of semiconductors decrease with\n\nincreasing temperatures. A typical dependence is shown in Fig. 3.11.\n\nWe can qualitatively understand the temperature dependence of\n\nresistivity, in the light of our derivation of Eq. (3.23). From this equation,\n\nresistivity of a material is given by\n\n2\n\n1 m\n\nn e\nρ\n\nσ τ\n= = (3.27)\n\nρ thus depends inversely both on the number n of free electrons per unit\nvolume and on the average time τ between collisions. As we increase\ntemperature, average speed of the electrons, which act as the carriers of\n\ncurrent, increases resulting in more frequent collisions. The average time\n\nof collisions τ, thus decreases with temperature.\nIn a metal, n is not dependent on temperature to any appreciable\n\nextent and thus the decrease in the value of τ with rise in temperature\ncauses ρ to increase as we have observed.\n\nFor insulators and semiconductors, however, n increases with\n\ntemperature. This increase more than compensates any decrease in τ in\nEq.(3.23) so that for such materials, ρ decreases with temperature.\n\nFIGURE 3.9\nResistivity ρ\n\nT\n of\n\ncopper as a function\n\nof temperature T.\n\nFIGURE 3.10 Resistivity\nρ\n\nT\n of nichrome as a\n\nfunction of absolute\n\ntemperature T.\n\nFIGURE 3.11\n\nTemperature dependence\nof resistivity for a typical\n\nsemiconductor.\n\nρ\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nCurrent\n\nElectricity\n\n105\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 3\n\n.4\n\nExample 3.3 An electric toaster uses nichrome for its heating\nelement. When a negligibly small current passes through it, its\n\nresistance at room temperature (27.0 °C) is found to be 75.3 Ω. When\nthe toaster is connected to a 230 V supply, the current settles, after\na few seconds, to a steady value of 2.68 A. What is the steady\n\ntemperature of the nichrome element? The temperature coefficient\nof resistance of nichrome averaged over the temperature range\ninvolved, is 1.70 × 10–4 °C–1.\n\nSolution  When the current through the element is very small, heating\neffects can be ignored and the temperature T\n\n1\n of the element is the\n\nsame as room temperature. When the toaster is connected to the\n\nsupply, its initial current will be slightly higher than its steady value\nof 2.68 A. But due to heating effect of the current, the temperature\nwill rise. This will cause an increase in resistance and a slight\n\ndecrease in current. In a few seconds, a steady state will be reached\nwhen temperature will rise no further, and both the resistance of the\nelement and the current drawn will achieve steady values. The\n\nresistance R\n2\n at the steady temperature T\n\n2\n is\n\nR\n2\n \n\n230 V\n85.8\n\n2.68 A\n= = Ω\n\nUsing the relation\n\nR\n2\n = R\n\n1\n [1 + α (T\n\n2\n – T\n\n1\n)]\n\nwith α = 1.70 × 10–4 °C–1, we get\n\nT\n2\n – T\n\n1 –4\n\n(85.8 – 75.3)\n\n(75.3) 1.70 10\n=\n\n× ×\n  = 820 °C\n\nthat is,  T\n2 \n= (820 + 27.0) °C = 847 °C\n\nThus, the steady temperature of the heating element (when heating\neffect due to the current equals heat loss to the surroundings) is\n847 °C.\n\nExample 3.4 The resistance of the platinum wire of a platinum\nresistance thermometer at the ice point is 5 Ω and at steam point is\n5.23 Ω.

The electric potential at A and B are denoted by V (A)\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 3\n\n.3\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n106\n\nand V (B) respectively. Since current is flowing from A to B, V (A) > V (B)\nand the potential difference across  AB is V = V(A) – V(B) > 0.\n\nIn a time interval ∆t, an amount of charge ∆Q = I ∆t travels from A to\nB. The potential energy of the charge at A, by definition, was Q V (A) and\nsimilarly at B, it is Q V(B). Thus, change in its potential energy ∆U\n\npot\n is\n\n∆U\npot\n\n = Final potential energy – Initial potential energy\n         = ∆Q[(V (B) – V (A)] = –∆Q V\n         = –I V∆t < 0 (3.28)\nIf charges moved without collisions through the conductor, their\n\nkinetic energy would also change so that the total energy is unchanged.\nConservation of total energy would then imply that,\n\n∆K =  –∆U\npot\n\n(3.29)\n\nthat is,\n\n∆K = I V∆t > 0 (3.30)\nThus, in case charges were moving freely through the conductor under\n\nthe action of electric field, their kinetic energy would increase as they\nmove. We have, however, seen earlier that on the average, charge carriers\n\ndo not move with acceleration but with a steady drift velocity. This is\nbecause of the collisions with ions and atoms during transit. During\ncollisions, the energy gained by the charges thus is shared with the atoms.\n\nThe atoms vibrate more vigorously, i.e., the conductor heats up. Thus,\nin an actual conductor, an amount of energy dissipated as heat in the\nconductor during the time interval ∆t is,\n\n∆W = I V∆t (3.31)\nThe energy dissipated per unit time is the power dissipated\n\nP = ∆W/∆t  and we have,\nP = I V (3.32)\n\nUsing Ohm’s law V = IR, we get\n\nP = I \n2\n R = V \n\n2\n/R (3.33)\n\nas the power loss (“ohmic loss”) in a conductor of resistance R carrying a\ncurrent I. It is this power which heats up, for example, the coil of an\n\nelectric bulb to incandescence, radiating out heat and\n\nlight.\nWhere does the power come from? As we have\n\nreasoned before, we need an external source to keep\n\na steady current through the conductor. It is clearly\nthis source which must supply this power. In the\nsimple circuit shown with a cell (Fig.3.12), it is the\n\nchemical energy of the cell which supplies this power\nfor as long as it can.\n\nThe expressions for power, Eqs. (3.32) and (3.33),\n\nshow the dependence of the power dissipated in a\nresistor R on the current through it and the voltage\nacross it.\n\nEquation (3.33) has an important application to\npower transmission. Electrical power is transmitted\nfrom power stations to homes and factories, which\n\nFIGURE 3.12 Heat is produced in the\nresistor R which is connected across\n\nthe terminals of a cell. The energy\n\ndissipated in the resistor R comes from\nthe chemical energy of the electrolyte.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nCurrent\n\nElectricity\n\n107\n\nmay be hundreds of miles away, via transmission cables. One obviously\nwants to minimise the power loss in the transmission cables connecting\n\nthe power stations to homes and factories. We shall  see now how this\ncan be achieved. Consider a device R, to which a power P is to be delivered\nvia transmission cables having a resistance R\n\nc\n to be dissipated by it finally.\n\nIf V is the voltage across R and I the current through it, then\nP = V I (3.34)\nThe connecting wires from the power station to the device has a finite\n\nresistance R\nc\n. The power dissipated in the connecting wires, which is\n\nwasted is P\nc\n  with\n\nP\nc\n = I\n\n2\n R\n\nc\n\n   \n2\n\n2\n\ncP R\n\nV\n= (3.35)\n\nfrom Eq. (3.32). Thus, to drive a device of power P, the power wasted in the\n\nconnecting wires is inversely proportional to V \n2\n. The  transmission cables\n\nfrom power stations are hundreds of miles long and their resistance R\nc\n is\n\nconsiderable. To reduce P\nc\n, these wires carry current at enormous values\n\nof V and this is the reason for the high voltage danger signs on transmission\nlines — a common sight as we move away from populated areas. Using\nelectricity at such voltages is not safe and hence at the other end, a device\n\ncalled a transformer lowers the voltage to a value suitable for use.\n\n3.10 COMBINATION OF RESISTORS – SERIES AND\nPARALLEL\n\nThe current through a single resistor R across which there is a potential\n\ndifference V is given by Ohm’s law I = V/R. Resistors are sometimes joined\ntogether and there are simple rules for calculation of equivalent resistance\nof such combination.\n\nFIGURE 3.13 A series combination of two resistors R\n1\n and R\n\n2\n.\n\nTwo resistors are said to be in series if only one of their end points is\njoined (Fig. 3.13). If a third resistor is joined with the series combination\nof the two (Fig. 3.14), then all three are said to be in series. Clearly, we\n\ncan extend this definition to series combination of any number of resistors.\n\nFIGURE 3.14 A series combination of three resistors R\n1\n, R\n\n2\n, R\n\n3\n.\n\nTwo or more resistors are said to be in parallel if one end of all the\nresistors is joined together and similarly the other ends joined together\n\n(Fig. 3.15).\n\nFIGURE 3.15 Two resistors R\n1\n and R\n\n2\n connected in parallel.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n108\n\nConsider two resistors R\n1\n and R\n\n2\n in series. The charge which leaves R\n\n1\n\nmust be entering R\n2\n. Since current measures the rate of flow of charge,\n\nthis means that the same current I flows through R\n1\n and R\n\n2\n. By Ohm’s law:\n\nPotential difference across R\n1\n = V\n\n1\n = I R\n\n1\n, and\n\nPotential difference across R\n2\n = V\n\n2\n = I R\n\n2\n.\n\nThe potential difference V across the combination is V\n1\n+V\n\n2\n. Hence,\n\nV = V\n1\n+ V\n\n2\n = I (R\n\n1\n + R\n\n2\n) (3.36)\n\nThis is as if the combination had an equivalent resistance R\neq\n\n, which\n\nby Ohm’s law is\n\nR\neq\n\n \nV\n\nI\n≡  = (R\n\n1\n + R\n\n2\n) (3.37)\n\nIf we had three resistors connected in series, then similarly\n\nV = I R\n1\n + I R\n\n2\n + I R\n\n3\n = I (R\n\n1\n+ R\n\n2\n+ R\n\n3\n). (3.38)\n\nThis obviously can be extended to a series combination of any number\nn of resistors R\n\n1\n, R\n\n2\n ....., R\n\nn\n. The equivalent resistance R\n\neq\n is\n\nR\neq\n\n = R\n1\n + R\n\n2\n + . . . + R\n\nn\n(3.39)\n\nConsider now the parallel combination of two resistors (Fig. 3.15).\nThe charge that flows in at A from the left flows out partly through R\n\n1\n\nand partly through R\n2\n. The currents I, I\n\n1\n, I\n\n2\n shown in the figure are the\n\nrates of flow of charge at the points indicated. Hence,\n\nI = I\n1\n + I\n\n2\n(3.40)\n\nThe potential difference between A and B is given by the Ohm’s law\napplied to R\n\n1\n\nV = I\n1\n R\n\n1\n(3.41)\n\nAlso, Ohm’s law applied to R\n2\n gives\n\nV = I\n2\n R\n\n2\n(3.42)\n\n∴ I = I\n1\n + I\n\n2\n = \n\nV\n\nR\n\nV\n\nR\nV\n\nR R1 2 1 2\n\n1 1\n+ = +\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7 (3.43)\n\nIf the combination was replaced by an equivalent resistance R\neq\n\n, we\nwould have, by Ohm’s law\n\neq\n\nV\nI\n\nR\n= (3.44)\n\nHence,\n\n1 2\n\n1 1 1\n\neqR R R\n= + (3.45)\n\nWe can easily see how this extends to three resistors in parallel\n(Fig. 3.16).\n\nFIGURE 3.16 Parallel combination of three resistors R\n1\n, R\n\n2\n and R\n\n3\n.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nCurrent\n\nElectricity\n\n109\n\nExactly as before\n\nI = I\n1\n + I\n\n2\n + I\n\n3\n(3.46)\n\nand applying Ohm’s law to R\n1\n, R\n\n2\n and R\n\n3\n we get,\n\nV = I\n1\n R\n\n1\n, V = I\n\n2\n R\n\n2\n, V = I\n\n3\n R\n\n3\n(3.47)\n\nSo that\n\nI = I\n1\n + I\n\n2\n + I\n\n3\n =V\n\nR R R\n\n1 1 1\n\n1 2 3\n\n+ +\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n(3.48)\n\nAn equivalent resistance R\neq\n\n that replaces the combination, would be\nsuch that\n\neq\n\nV\nI\n\nR\n= (3.49)\n\nand hence\n\n1 2 3\n\n1 1 1 1\n\neqR R R R\n= + + (3.50)\n\nWe can reason similarly for any number of resistors in parallel.

Basically a cell has\n\ntwo electrodes, called the positive (P) and the negative (N), as shown in\nFig. 3.18. They are immersed in an electrolytic solution. Dipped in the\n\nsolution, the electrodes exchange charges with the electrolyte. The\n\npositive electrode has a potential difference V\n+\n (V\n\n+\n > 0) between\n\nitself and the electrolyte solution immediately adjacent to it marked\nA in the figure. Similarly, the negative electrode develops a negative\n\npotential  – (V\n–\n ) (V\n\n–\n ≥  0) relative to the electrolyte adjacent to it,\n\nmarked as B in the figure. When there is no current, the electrolyte\nhas the same potential throughout, so that the potential difference\nbetween P and N is V\n\n+\n – (–V\n\n–\n) = V\n\n+\n + V\n\n–\n . This difference is called the\n\nelectromotive force (emf) of the cell and is denoted by ε. Thus\nε = V\n\n+\n+V\n\n–\n > \n\n \n0 (3.55)\n\nNote that ε is, actually, a potential difference and not a force. The\nname emf, however, is used because of historical reasons, and was\ngiven at a time when the phenomenon was not understood properly.\n\nTo understand the significance of ε, consider a resistor R\nconnected across the cell (Fig. 3.18). A current I flows across R\nfrom C to D. As explained before, a steady current is maintained\nbecause current flows from N to P through the electrolyte. Clearly,\n\nacross the electrolyte the same current flows through the electrolyte\nbut from N to P, whereas through R, it flows from P to N.\n\nThe electrolyte through which a current flows has a finite\n\nresistance r, called the internal resistance. Consider first the\nsituation when R is infinite so that I = V/R = 0, where V is the\npotential difference between P and N. Now,\n\nV = Potential difference between P and A\n       + Potential difference between A and B\n       + Potential  difference between B and N\n\n   = ε (3.56)\nThus, emf ε is the potential difference between the positive and\nnegative electrodes in an open circuit, i.e., when no current is\n\nflowing through the cell.\nIf however R is finite, I is not zero. In that case the potential\n\ndifference between P and N is\n\nV = V\n+\n+ V\n\n–\n – I r\n\n   = ε – I r (3.57)\nNote the negative sign in the expression (I r ) for the potential difference\n\nbetween A and B. This is because the current I flows from B to A in the\n\nelectrolyte.\n\nIn  practical calculations, internal resistances of cells in the circuit\nmay be neglected when the  current I is such that ε >> I r. The actual\nvalues of the internal resistances of cells vary from cell to cell. The internal\n\nresistance of dry cells, however, is much higher than the common\n\nelectrolytic cells.\n\nFIGURE 3.18 (a) Sketch of\nan electrolyte cell with\n\npositive terminal P and\nnegative terminal N.

(3.57) and (3.58), we get\n\nI  R   =  ε – I  r\n\nOr, I\nR r\n\n=\n+\nε\n\n(3.59)\n\nThe maximum current that can be drawn from a cell is for R = 0 and\nit is I\n\nmax\n = ε/r. However, in most cells the maximum allowed current is\n\nmuch lower than this to prevent permanent damage to the cell.\n\nCHARGES IN CLOUDS\n\nIn olden days lightning was considered as an atmospheric flash of supernatural origin.\n\nIt was believed to be the great weapon of Gods. But today the phenomenon of lightning\ncan be explained scientifically by elementary principles of physics.\n\nAtmospheric electricity arises due to the separation of electric charges. In the\n\nionosphere and magnetosphere strong electric current is generated from the solar-\nterrestrial interaction. In the lower atmosphere, the current is weaker and is maintained\nby thunderstorm.\n\nThere are ice particles in the clouds, which grow, collide, fracture and break apart.\nThe smaller particles acquire positive charge and the larger ones negative charge. These\ncharged particles get separated by updrifts in the clouds and gravity. The upper portion\n\nof the cloud becomes positively charged and the middle negatively charged, leading to\ndipole structure. Sometimes a very weak positive charge is found near the base of the\ncloud. The ground is positively charged at the time of thunderstorm development. Also,\n\ncosmic and radioactive radiations ionise air into positive and negative ions and the air\nbecomes (weakly) electrically conductive. The separation of charges produce tremendous\namount of electrical potential within the cloud, as well, as between the cloud and ground.\n\nThis can amount to millions of volts and eventually the electrical resistance in the air\nbreaks down and lightning flash begins and thousands of amperes of current flows. The\nelectric field is of the order of 10\n\n5\n V/m. A lightning flash is composed of a series of\n\nstrokes with an average of about four and the duration of each flash is about 30 seconds.\nThe average peak power per stroke is about 10\n\n12\n watts.\n\nDuring fair weather also there is charge in the atmosphere. The fair weather electric\n\nfield arises due to the existence of a surface charge density at ground and an atmospheric\nconductivity, as well as, due to the flow of current from the ionosphere to the earth’s\nsurface, which is of the order of picoampere / square metre. The surface charge density\n\nat ground is negative; the electric field is directed downward. Over land the average\nelectric field is about 120 V/m, which corresponds to a surface charge density of\n–1.2 × 10\n\n–9\n C/m\n\n2\n. Over the entire earth’s surface, the total negative charge amount to\n\nabout 600 kC. An equal positive charge exists in the atmosphere. This electric field is not\nnoticeable in daily life. The reason why it is not noticed is that virtually everything, including\nour bodies, is conductor compared to air.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n112  E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 3\n\n.5\n\nExample 3.5 A network of resistors is connected to a 16 V battery\n\nwith internal resistance of 1Ω, as shown in Fig. 3.19: (a) Compute\nthe equivalent resistance of the network.

(c) Obtain the voltage drops V\n\nAB\n, V\n\nBC\n and V\n\nCD\n.\n\nFIGURE 3.19\n\nSolution\n(a) The network is a simple series and parallel combination of\n\nresistors. First the two 4Ω resistors in parallel are equivalent to a\nresistor = [(4 × 4)/(4 + 4)] Ω = 2 Ω.\nIn the same way, the 12 Ω and 6 Ω resistors in parallel are\nequivalent to a resistor of\n\n[(12 × 6)/(12 + 6)] Ω = 4 Ω.\nThe equivalent resistance R of the network is obtained by\ncombining these resistors (2 Ω and 4 Ω) with 1 Ω in series,\nthat is,\nR = 2 Ω + 4 Ω + 1 Ω = 7 Ω.\n\n(b) The total current I in the circuit is\n\n16\n2 A\n\n(7 1)\n\nε\n= = =\n\n+ + Ω\n\nV\nI\n\nR r\n\nConsider the resistors between A and B. If I\n1\n is the current in one\n\nof the 4 Ω resistors and I\n2\n the current in the other,\n\nI\n1\n × 4 = I\n\n2\n × 4\n\nthat is, I\n1\n = I\n\n2\n, which is otherwise obvious from the symmetry of\n\nthe two arms. But I\n1\n + I\n\n2\n = I = 2 A. Thus,\n\nI\n1\n = I\n\n2\n = 1 A\n\nthat is, current in each 4 Ω resistor is 1 A. Current in 1 Ω resistor\nbetween B and C would be 2 A.\nNow, consider the resistances between C and D. If I\n\n3\n is the current\n\nin the 12 Ω resistor, and I\n4\n in the 6 Ω resistor,\n\nI\n3\n × 12 = I\n\n4\n × 6, i.e., I\n\n4\n = 2I\n\n3\n\n      But, I\n3\n + I\n\n4\n = I = 2 A\n\n      Thus, I\n3\n =\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7  A, I4 =  \n\n4\n\n3\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7  A\n\nthat is, the current in the 12 Ω resistor is (2/3) A, while the current\nin the 6 Ω resistor is (4/3) A.\n\n(c) The voltage drop across AB is\n\nV\nAB\n\n = I\n1\n × 4 = 1 A × 4 Ω = 4 V,\n\nThis can also be obtained by multiplying the total current between\n\nA and B by the equivalent resistance between A and B, that is,\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nCurrent\n\nElectricity\n\n113\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 3\n\n.5\n\nV\nAB\n\n = 2 A × 2 Ω = 4 V\n\nThe voltage drop across BC is\n\nV\nBC\n\n = 2 A × 1 Ω = 2 V\n\nFinally, the voltage drop across CD is\n\nV\nCD\n\n = 12 Ω × I\n3\n = 12 Ω × \n\n2\n\n3\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7  A = 8 V.\n\nThis can alternately be obtained by multiplying total current\nbetween C and D by the equivalent resistance between C and D,\n\nthat is,\n\nV\nCD\n\n = 2 A × 4 Ω = 8 V\nNote that the total voltage drop across AD is 4 V + 2 V + 8 V = 14 V.\n\nThus, the terminal voltage of the battery is 14 V, while its emf is 16 V.\nThe loss of the voltage (= 2 V) is accounted for by the internal resistance\n\n1 Ω of the battery [2 A × 1 Ω = 2 V].\n\n3.12  CELLS IN SERIES AND IN PARALLEL\nLike resistors, cells can be combined together in an electric circuit. And\nlike resistors, one can, for calculating currents and voltages in a circuit,\nreplace a combination of cells by an equivalent cell.\n\nFIGURE 3.20 Two cells of emf’s ε\n1\n and ε\n\n2\n in the series. r\n\n1\n, r\n\n2\n are their\n\ninternal resistances. For connections across A and C, the combination\n\ncan be considered as one cell of emf ε\neq\n\n and an internal resistance r\neq\n\n.\n\nConsider first  two cells in series (Fig. 3.20), where one terminal of the\ntwo cells is joined together leaving the other terminal in either cell free.\nε\n\n1\n, ε\n\n2\n are the emf’s of the two cells and r\n\n1\n, r\n\n2\n their internal resistances,\n\nrespectively.\n\nLet V (A), V (B), V (C) be the potentials at points A, B and C shown in\n\nFig. 3.20. Then V (A) – V (B) is the potential difference between the positive\n\nand negative terminals of the first cell. We have already calculated it in\n\nEq. (3.57) and hence,\n\nAB 1 1(A) – (B) –V V V I rε≡ = (3.60)\n\nSimilarly,\n\nBC 2 2(B) – (C) –V V V I rε≡ = (3.61)\n\nHence, the potential difference between the terminals A and C of the\n\ncombination is\n\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( )AC (A) – (C) A – B B – CV V V V V V V≡ = +        \n       ( ) ( )1 2 1 2– I r rε ε= + + (3.62)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n114\n\nIf we wish to replace the combination by a single cell between A and\nC of emf ε\n\neq\n and internal resistance r\n\neq\n, we would have\n\nV\nAC\n\n = ε\neq\n\n– I r\neq\n\n(3.63)\n\nComparing the last two equations, we get\n\n  ε\neq\n\n = ε\n1\n + ε\n\n2\n(3.64)\n\nand  r\neq\n\n = r\n1\n + r\n\n2\n(3.65)\n\nIn Fig.3.20, we had connected the negative electrode of the first to the\npositive electrode of the second. If instead we connect the two negatives,\n\nEq. (3.61) would change to V\nBC\n\n = –ε\n2\n–Ir\n\n2\n and we will get\n\nε\neq\n\n = ε\n1\n – ε2         (ε1 > ε2) (3.66)\n\nThe rule for series combination clearly can be extended to any number\n\nof cells:\n(i) The equivalent emf of a series combination of n cells is just the sum of\n\ntheir individual emf’s, and\n\n(ii) The equivalent internal resistance of a series combination of n cells is\njust the sum of their internal resistances.\n\nThis is so, when the current leaves each cell from the positive\n\nelectrode. If in the combination, the current leaves any cell from\nthe negative electrode, the emf of the cell enters the expression\nfor ε\n\neq\n with a negative sign, as in Eq. (3.66).\n\nNext, consider a parallel combination of the cells (Fig. 3.21).\nI\n1\n and I\n\n2\n are the currents leaving the positive electrodes of the\n\ncells. At the point B\n1\n, I\n\n1\n and I\n\n2\n flow in whereas the current I flows\n\nout. Since as much charge flows in as out, we have\n\nI = I\n1\n + I\n\n2\n(3.67)\n\nLet V (B\n1\n) and V (B\n\n2\n) be the potentials at B\n\n1\n and B\n\n2\n, respectively.\n\nThen, considering the first cell, the potential difference across its\nterminals is V (B\n\n1\n) – V (B\n\n2\n). Hence, from Eq. (3.57)\n\n( ) ( )1 2 1 1 1– –V V B V B I rε≡ = (3.68)\nPoints B\n\n1\n and B\n\n2\n are connected exactly similarly to the second\n\ncell. Hence considering the second cell, we also have\n\n( ) ( )1 2 2 2 2– –V V B V B I rε≡ = (3.69)\nCombining the last three equations\n\n1 2    I I I= +\n\n    = + = +\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n+\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\nε ε ε ε1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2 1 2\n\n1 1– –\n–\n\nV\n\nr\n\nV\n\nr r r\nV\n\nr r\n(3.70)\n\nHence, V is given by,\n\n1 2 2 1 1 2\n\n1 2 1 2\n\n–\nr r r r\n\nV I\nr r r r\n\nε ε+\n=\n\n+ + (3.71)\n\nIf we want to replace the combination by a single cell, between B\n1\n and\n\nB\n2\n, of emf ε\n\neq\n and internal resistance r\n\neq\n, we would have\n\nV = ε\neq \n\n– I r\neq\n\n(3.72)\n\nFIGURE 3.21 Two cells in\n\nparallel.

The formulae we have\nderived earlier for series and parallel combinations of resistors are not\n\nalways sufficient to determine all the currents and potential differences\nin the circuit. Two rules, called Kirchhoff’s rules, are very useful for\nanalysis of electric circuits.\n\nGiven a circuit, we start by labelling currents in each resistor by a\nsymbol, say I, and a directed arrow to indicate that a current I flows\nalong the resistor in the direction indicated. If ultimately I is determined\n\nto be positive, the actual current in the resistor is in the direction of the\narrow. If I turns out to be negative, the current actually flows in a direction\nopposite to the arrow. Similarly, for each source (i.e., cell or some other\n\nsource of electrical power) the positive and negative electrodes are labelled,\nas well as, a directed arrow with a symbol for the current flowing through\nthe cell. This will tell us the potential difference, V = V (P) – V (N) = ε – I r\n\nGustav Robert Kirchhoff\n(1824 – 1887) German\nphysicist, professor at\n\nHeidelberg and at\nBerlin. Mainly known for\nhis development of\n\nspectroscopy, he also\nmade many important\ncontributions to mathe-\n\nmatical physics, among\nthem, his first and\nsecond rules for circuits.\n\nG\nU\n\nS\nT\nA\nV\n\n R\nO\n\nB\nE\n\nR\nT\n K\n\nIR\nC\n\nH\nH\n\nO\nF\nF\n (1\n\n8\n2\n4\n –\n\n 1\n8\n8\n7\n)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n116  \nE\n\nX\nA\n\nM\nP\nL\nE\n 3\n\n.6\n\n[Eq. (3.57) between the positive terminal P and the negative terminal N; I\nhere is the current flowing from N to P through the cell]. If, while labelling\n\nthe current I through the cell one goes from P to N,\nthen of course\n\nV = ε + I r (3.79)\nHaving clarified labelling, we now state the rules\n\nand the proof:\n(a) Junction rule: At any junction, the sum of the\n\ncurrents entering the junction is equal to the\n\nsum of currents leaving the junction (Fig. 3.22).\nThis applies equally well if instead of a junction of\nseveral lines, we consider a point in a line.\n\nThe proof of this rule follows from the fact that\nwhen currents are steady, there is no accumulation\nof charges at any junction or at any point in a line.\n\nThus, the total current flowing in, (which is the rate\nat which charge flows into the junction), must equal\nthe total current flowing out.\n\n(b) Loop rule: The algebraic sum of changes in\npotential around any closed loop involving\n\nresistors and cells in the loop is zero (Fig. 3.22).\n\nThis rule is also obvious, since electric potential is\ndependent on the location of the point. Thus starting with any point if we\ncome back to the same point, the total change must be zero. In a closed\n\nloop, we do come back to the starting point and hence the rule.\n\nExample 3.6 A battery of 10 V and negligible internal resistance is\nconnected across the diagonally opposite corners of a cubical network\n\nconsisting of 12 resistors each of resistance 1 Ω (Fig. 3.23). Determine\nthe equivalent resistance of the network and the current along each\nedge of the cube.\n\nFIGURE 3.23\n\nFIGURE 3.22 At junction a the current\n\nleaving is I\n1\n + I\n\n2\n and current entering is I\n\n3\n.\n\nThe junction rule says I\n3\n = I\n\n1\n + I\n\n2\n. At point\n\nh current entering is I\n1\n. There is only one\n\ncurrent leaving h and by junction rule\nthat will also be I\n\n1\n.

There is, however, a clear symmetry in the\n\nproblem which we can exploit to obtain the equivalent resistance of\nthe network.\nThe paths AA′, AD and AB are obviously symmetrically placed in the\nnetwork. Thus, the current in each must be the same, say, I. Further,\nat the corners A′, B and D, the incoming current I must split equally\ninto the two outgoing branches. In this manner, the current in all\n\nthe 12 edges of the cube are easily written down in terms of I, using\nKirchhoff’s first rule and the symmetry in the problem.\nNext take a closed loop, say, ABCC′EA, and apply Kirchhoff’s second\nrule:\n\n–IR – (1/2)IR – IR + ε = 0\nwhere R is the resistance of each edge and ε the emf of battery. Thus,\n\nε = \n5\n\n2\nI R\n\nThe equivalent resistance R\neq\n\n of the network is\n\n5\n\n3 6\neq\n\nR R\nI\n\nε\n= =\n\nFor R = 1 Ω, R\neq\n\n = (5/6) Ω and for ε = 10 V, the total current (= 3I ) in\nthe network is\n\n3I = 10 V/(5/6) Ω = 12 A, i.e., I = 4 A\nThe current flowing in each edge can now be read off from the\n\nFig. 3.23.\n\nIt should be noted that because of the symmetry of the network, the\ngreat power of Kirchhoff’s rules has not been very apparent in Example 3.6.\nIn a general network, there will be no such simplification due to\n\nsymmetry, and only by application of Kirchhoff’s rules to junctions and\nclosed loops (as many as necessary to solve the unknowns in the network)\ncan we handle the problem. This will be illustrated in Example 3.7.\n\nExample 3.7 Determine the current in each branch of the network\nshown in Fig. 3.24.\n\nFIGURE 3.24\n\nS\nim\n\nila\ntio\n\nn\n \nfo\n\nr\n \na\n\np\np\n\nlic\na\n\ntio\nn\n\n \no\n\nf \nK\n\nir\nc\nh\n\nh\no\n\nff\n’s\n\n \nr\nu\n\nle\ns\n:\n\nh\nttp\n\n://w\nw\n\nw\n.p\n\nh\ny\ns.h\n\na\nw\n\na\nii.e\n\nd\nu\n/~\n\nte\nb\n/o\n\np\ntic\n\ns/ja\nv\na\n/k\n\nirc\nh\n3\n/\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 3\n\n.7\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n118\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 3\n\n.7\n\nSolution  Each branch of the network is assigned an unknown current\nto be determined by the application of Kirchhoff’s rules. To reduce\n\nthe number of unknowns at the outset, the first rule of Kirchhoff is\nused at every junction to assign the unknown current in each branch.\nWe then have three unknowns I\n\n1\n, I\n\n2\n and I\n\n3\n which can be found by\n\napplying the second rule of Kirchhoff to three different closed loops.\nKirchhoff’s second rule for the closed loop ADCA gives,\n\n10 – 4(I\n1\n– I\n\n2\n) + 2(I\n\n2\n + I\n\n3\n – I\n\n1\n) – I\n\n1\n = 0 [3.80(a)]\n\nthat is, 7I\n1\n– 6I\n\n2\n – 2I\n\n3\n = 10\n\nFor the closed loop ABCA, we get\n\n10 – 4I\n2\n– 2 (I\n\n2\n + I\n\n3\n) – I\n\n1\n = 0\n\nthat is, I\n1\n + 6I\n\n2\n + 2I\n\n3\n =10 [3.80(b)]\n\nFor the closed loop BCDEB, we get\n\n5 – 2 (I\n2\n + I\n\n3\n) – 2 (I\n\n2\n + I\n\n3\n – I\n\n1\n) = 0\n\nthat is, 2I\n1\n – 4I\n\n2\n – 4I\n\n3\n = –5 [3.80(c)]\n\nEquations (3.80 a, b, c) are three simultaneous equations in three\n\nunknowns. These can be solved by the usual method to give\n\nI\n1\n = 2.5A,   I\n\n2\n = \n\n5\n\n8\n A,   I\n\n3\n = \n\n7\n1\n\n8\n  A\n\nThe currents in the various branches of the network are\n\nAB : \n5\n\n8\n A,   CA : \n\n1\n2\n\n2\n A,   DEB : \n\n7\n1\n\n8\n  A\n\nAD : \n7\n\n1\n8\n\n A,   CD : 0 A,   BC : \n1\n\n2\n2\n\n A\n\nIt is easily verified that Kirchhoff’s second rule applied to the\n\nremaining closed loops does not provide any additional independent\nequation, that is, the above values of currents satisfy the second\nrule for every closed loop of the network.

The bridge has\n\nfour resistors R\n1\n, R\n\n2\n, R\n\n3\n and R\n\n4\n. Across one pair of diagonally opposite\n\npoints (A and C in the figure) a source is connected. This (i.e., AC) is\n\ncalled the battery arm. Between the other two vertices, B and D, a\n\ngalvanometer G (which is a device to detect currents) is connected. This\n\nline, shown as BD in the figure, is called the galvanometer arm.\n\nFor simplicity, we assume that the cell has no internal resistance. In\ngeneral there will be currents flowing across all the resistors as well as a\n\ncurrent I\ng\n through G. Of special interest, is the case of a balanced bridge\n\nwhere the resistors are such that I\ng\n = 0. We can easily get the balance\n\ncondition, such that there is no current through G. In this case, the\n\nKirchhoff’s junction rule applied to junctions D and B (see the figure)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nCurrent\n\nElectricity\n\n119\n\nimmediately gives us the relations I\n1\n = I\n\n3\n and I\n\n2\n = I\n\n4\n. Next, we apply\n\nKirchhoff’s loop rule to closed loops ADBA and CBDC. The first\nloop gives\n\n–I\n1\n R\n\n1\n + 0 + I\n\n2\n R\n\n2\n = 0        (I\n\ng\n = 0)  (3.81)\n\nand the second loop gives, upon using I\n3\n = I\n\n1\n, I\n\n4\n = I\n\n2\n\nI\n2\n R\n\n4\n + 0 – I\n\n1\n R\n\n3\n = 0        (3.82)\n\nFrom Eq. (3.81), we obtain,\n\n1 2\n\n2 1\n\nI R\n\nI R\n=\n\nwhereas from Eq. (3.82), we obtain,\n\n1 4\n\n2 3\n\nI R\n\nI R\n=\n\nHence, we obtain the condition\n\n2 4\n\n1 3\n\nR R\n\nR R\n= [3.83(a)]\n\n This last equation relating the four resistors is called the balance\ncondition for the galvanometer to give zero or null deflection.\n\nThe Wheatstone bridge and its balance condition provide a practical\nmethod for determination of an unknown resistance. Let us suppose we\nhave an unknown resistance, which we insert in the fourth arm; R\n\n4\n is\n\nthus not known. Keeping known resistances R\n1\n and R\n\n2\n in the first and\n\nsecond arm of the bridge, we go on varying R\n3\n till the galvanometer shows\n\na null deflection. The bridge then is balanced, and from the balance\ncondition the value of the unknown resistance R\n\n4\n is given by,\n\n2\n4 3\n\n1\n\nR\nR R\n\nR\n= [3.83(b)]\n\nA practical device using this principle is called the meter bridge. It\nwill be discussed in the next section.\n\nExample 3.8 The four arms of a Wheatstone bridge (Fig. 3.26) have\n\nthe following resistances:\nAB = 100Ω, BC = 10Ω, CD = 5Ω, and DA = 60Ω.\n\nFIGURE 3.26\n\nFIGURE 3.25\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 3\n\n.8\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n120\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 3\n\n.8\n\n A galvanometer of 15Ω resistance is connected across BD.

(3.84b) by 10\n\n20I\n1\n – 60I\n\ng\n – 10I\n\n2\n = 0 [3.84(d)]\n\nFrom Eqs.

It consists of\na wire of length 1m and of uniform cross sectional\n\narea stretched taut and clamped between two thick\n\nmetallic strips bent at right angles, as shown. The\n\nmetallic strip has two gaps across which resistors can\nbe connected. The end points where the wire is\n\nclamped are connected to a cell through a key. One\n\nend of a galvanometer is connected to the metallic\n\nstrip midway between the two gaps. The other end of\nthe galvanometer is connected to a ‘jockey’. The jockey\n\nis essentially a metallic rod whose one end has a\n\nknife-edge which can slide over the wire to make\n\nelectrical connection.\nR is an unknown resistance whose value we want to determine. It is\n\nconnected across one of the gaps. Across the other gap, we connect a\n\nFIGURE 3.27 A meter bridge. Wire AC\n\nis 1 m long. R is a resistance to be\nmeasured and S is a standard\n\nresistance.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nCurrent\n\nElectricity\n\n121\n\nstandard known resistance S. The jockey is connected to some point D\non the wire, a distance l  cm from the end A. The jockey can be moved\n\nalong the wire. The portion AD of the wire has a resistance R\ncm\n\nl, where\nR\n\ncm\n  is the  resistance of the wire per unit centimetre. The portion DC of\n\nthe wire similarly has a resistance R\ncm\n\n  (100-l ).\nThe four arms AB, BC, DA and CD  [with resistances R, S, R\n\ncm\n l and\n\nR\ncm\n\n(100-l )] obviously form a Wheatstone bridge with AC as the battery\narm and BD the galvanometer arm. If the jockey is moved along the wire,\n\nthen there will be one position where the galvanometer will show no\ncurrent. Let the distance of the jockey from the end A at the balance\npoint be l= l\n\n1\n. The four resistances of the bridge at the balance point then\n\nare R, S,  R\ncm\n\n l\n1\n and  R\n\ncm\n(100–l\n\n1\n). The balance condition, Eq. [3.83(a)]\n\ngives\n\n( )\n1 1\n\n1 1100 – 100 –\ncm\n\ncm\n\nR l lR\n\nS R l l\n= = (3.85)\n\nThus, once we have found out l\n1\n, the unknown resistance R is known\n\nin terms of the standard known resistance S by\n\n1\n\n1100 –\n\nl\nR S\n\nl\n= (3.86)\n\nBy choosing various values of S, we would get various values of l\n1\n,\n\nand calculate R each time. An error in measurement of l\n1\n would naturally\n\nresult in an error in R. It can be shown that the percentage error in R  can\nbe minimised by adjusting the balance point near the middle of the\n\nbridge, i.e., when l\n1\n is close to 50 cm. (This requires a suitable choice\n\nof S.)\n\nExample 3.9 In a meter bridge (Fig. 3.27), the null point is found at a\n\ndistance of 33.7 cm from A. If now a resistance of 12Ω is connected in\nparallel with S, the null point occurs at 51.9 cm. Determine the values\nof R and S.\n\nSolution  From the first balance point, we get\n\n33.7\n\n66.3\n\nR\n\nS\n= (3.87)\n\nAfter S is connected in parallel with a resistance of 12Ω , the resistance\nacross the gap changes from S to S\n\neq\n, where\n\n12\n\n12\neq\n\nS\nS\n\nS\n=\n\n+\nand hence the new balance condition now gives\n\n( )1251.9\n48.1 12\n\neq\n\nR SR\n\nS S\n\n+\n= = (3.88)\n\nSubstituting the value of R/S from Eq. (3.87), we get\n\n51.9 12 33.7\n\n48.1 12 66.3\n\n+\n= .\n\nS\n\nwhich gives S = 13.5Ω. Using the value of R/S above, we get\nR = 6.86 Ω.\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 3\n\n.9\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n122\n\n3.16  POTENTIOMETER\nThis is a versatile instrument. It is basically a long piece of uniform wire,\nsometimes a few meters in length across which a standard cell (B) is\n\nconnected. In actual design, the wire is sometimes cut in several pieces\nplaced side by side and connected at the ends by thick metal strip.\n(Fig. 3.28). In the figure, the wires run from A to C. The small vertical\n\nportions are the thick metal strips connecting the various sections of\nthe wire.\n\nA current I flows through the wire which can be varied by a variable\n\nresistance (rheostat, R) in the circuit. Since the wire is uniform, the\npotential difference between A and any point at a distance l from A is\n\n( )ε φ=l l (3.89)\nwhere φ is the potential drop per unit length.\n\nFigure 3.28 (a) shows an application of the potentiometer to compare\nthe emf of two cells of emf ε\n\n1\n and ε\n\n2\n . The points marked 1, 2, 3 form a two\n\nway key. Consider first a position of the key where 1 and 3 are connected\nso that the galvanometer is connected to ε\n\n1\n. The jockey\n\nis moved along the wire till at a point N\n1\n, at a distance l\n\n1\n\nfrom A, there is no deflection in the galvanometer. We\ncan apply Kirchhoff’s loop rule to the closed loop\nAN\n\n1\nG31A and get,\n\nφ l\n1\n + 0 – ε\n\n1\n = 0 (3.90)\n\nSimilarly, if another emf ε\n2\n is balanced against l\n\n2\n (AN\n\n2\n)\n\nφ l\n2\n + 0 – ε\n\n2\n = 0 (3.91)\n\nFrom the last two equations\n\n1 1\n\n2 2\n\nl\n\nl\n\nε\nε\n\n= (3.92)\n\nThis simple mechanism thus allows one to compare\n\nthe emf’s of any two sources (ε\n1\n,ε\n\n2\n). In practice one of the\n\ncells is chosen as a standard cell whose emf is known to\na high degree of accuracy. The emf of the other cell is\n\nthen easily calculated from Eq. (3.92).\nWe can also use a potentiometer to measure internal\n\nresistance of a cell [Fig. 3.28 (b)]. For this the cell (emf ε )\nwhose internal resistance (r) is to be determined is\nconnected across a resistance box through a key K\n\n2\n, as\n\nshown in the figure. With key K\n2\n open, balance is\n\nobtained at length l\n1\n (AN\n\n1\n). Then,\n\nε = φ l\n1\n\n[3.93(a)]\n\nWhen key K\n2\n is closed, the cell sends a current (I )\n\nthrough the resistance box (R). If V is the terminal\n\npotential difference of the cell and balance is obtained at\nlength l\n\n2 \n(AN\n\n2\n),\n\nV = φ l\n2\n\n[3.93(b)]\n\nFIGURE 3.28 A potentiometer. G is\na galvanometer and R a variable\n\nresistance (rheostat). 1, 2, 3 are\nterminals of a two way key\n\n(a) circuit for comparing emfs of two\n\ncells; (b) circuit for determining\ninternal resistance of a cell.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nCurrent\n\nElectricity\n\n123\n\nSo, we have ε/V = l\n1\n/l\n\n2\n[3.94(a)]\n\nBut, ε = I (r + R ) and V = IR. This gives\nε/V = (r+R )/R [3.94(b)]\n\nFrom Eq. [3.94(a)] and [3.94(b)] we have\n\n(R+r )/R = l\n1\n/l\n\n2\n\nr R\nl\n\nl\n=\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1– (3.95)\n\nUsing Eq. (3.95) we can find the internal resistance of a given cell.\n\nThe potentiometer has the advantage that it draws no current from\nthe voltage source being measured. As such it is unaffected by the internal\nresistance of the source.\n\nExample 3.10  A resistance of R Ω draws current from a\npotentiometer. The potentiometer has a total resistance R\n\n0\n Ω\n\n(Fig. 3.29). A voltage V is supplied to the potentiometer. Derive an\n\nexpression for the voltage across R when the sliding contact is in the\nmiddle of the potentiometer.\n\nFIGURE 3.29\n\nSolution  While the slide is in the middle of the potentiometer only\nhalf of its resistance (R\n\n0\n/2) will be between the points A and B. Hence,\n\nthe total resistance between A and B, say, R\n1\n, will be given by the\n\nfollowing expression:\n\n1 0\n\n1 1 1\n\n( /2)R R R\n= +\n\n0\n1\n\n0 2\n\nR R\nR\n\nR R\n=\n\n+\nThe total resistance between A and C will be sum of resistance between\nA and B and B and C, i.e., R\n\n1\n + R\n\n0\n/2\n\n∴ The current flowing through the potentiometer will be\n\n1 0 1 0\n\n2\n\n/2 2\n\nV V\nI\n\nR R R R\n= =\n\n+ +\n\nThe voltage V\n1\n taken from the potentiometer will be the product of\n\ncurrent I and resistance R\n1\n,\n\nV\n1\n = I R\n\n1\n = \n\n2\n\n2 1 0\n1\n\nV\n\nR R\nR\n\n+\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n×\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 3\n\n.1\n0\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n124\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 3\n\n.1\n0\n\nSubstituting for R\n1\n, we have a\n\nV\nV\n\nR R\n\nR R\nR\n\nR R\n\nR R\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2\n2\n\n2\n=\n\n×\n+\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n+\n×\n\n×\n+\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2 2\n\nVR\nV\n\nR R R\n=\n\n+ +\n\nor  V\n1\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nVR\n\nR R\n=\n\n+\n.\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. Current through a given area of a conductor is the net charge passing\n\nper unit time through the area.\n\n2. To maintain a steady current, we must have a closed circuit in which\n\nan external agency moves electric charge from lower to higher potential\n\nenergy. The work done per unit charge by the source in taking the\n\ncharge from lower to higher potential energy (i.e., from one terminal\n\nof the source to the other) is called the electromotive force, or emf, of\n\nthe source. Note that the emf is not a force; it is the voltage difference\nbetween the two terminals of a source in open circuit.\n\n3. Ohm’s law: The electric current I flowing through a substance is\n\nproportional to the voltage V across its ends, i.e., V ∝ I or V = RI,\nwhere R is called the resistance of the substance. The unit of resistance\n\nis ohm: 1Ω = 1 V A–1.\n4. The resistance R of a conductor depends on its length l and\n\ncross-sectional area A through the relation,\n\nl\nR\n\nA\n\nρ\n=\n\nwhere ρ, called resistivity is a property of the material and depends on\ntemperature and pressure.\n\n5. Electrical resistivity of substances varies over a very wide range. Metals\n\nhave low resistivity, in the range of 10\n–8\n\n Ω m to 10–6 Ω m. Insulators\nlike glass and rubber have 10\n\n22\n to 10\n\n24\n times greater resistivity.\n\nSemiconductors like Si and Ge lie roughly in the middle range of\n\nresistivity on a logarithmic scale.\n\n6. In most substances, the carriers of current are electrons; in some\n\ncases, for example, ionic crystals and electrolytic liquids, positive and\n\nnegative ions carry the electric current.\n\n7. Current density j gives the amount of charge flowing per second per\nunit area normal to the flow,\n\nj = nq v\nd\n\nwhere n is the number density (number per unit volume) of charge\n\ncarriers each of charge q, and v\nd\n is the drift velocity of the charge\n\ncarriers. For electrons q = – e. If j is normal to a cross-sectional area\nA and is constant over the area, the magnitude of the current I through\nthe area is nev\n\nd\n A.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nCurrent\n\nElectricity\n\n125\n\n8. Using E = V/l, I = nev\nd\n A, and Ohm’s law, one obtains\n\n2\n\nd\n\neE ne\nv\n\nm m\nρ=\n\nThe proportionality between the force eE on the electrons in a metal\n\ndue to the external field E and the drift velocity v\nd\n (not acceleration)\n\ncan be understood, if we assume that the electrons suffer collisions\nwith ions in the metal, which deflect them randomly. If such collisions\n\noccur on an average at a time interval τ,\nv\n\nd\n = aτ = eEτ/m\n\nwhere a is the acceleration of the electron. This gives\n\n2\n\nm\n\nne\nρ\n\nτ\n=\n\n9. In the temperature range in which resistivity increases linearly with\n\ntemperature, the temperature coefficient of resistivity α is defined as\nthe fractional increase in resistivity per unit increase in temperature.\n\n10. Ohm’s law is obeyed by many substances, but it is not a fundamental\n\nlaw of nature. It fails if\n\n(a) V depends on I non-linearly.\n(b) the relation between V and I depends on the sign of V for the same\n\nabsolute value of V.\n\n(c) The relation between V and I is non-unique.\n\nAn example of (a) is when ρ increases with I (even if temperature is\nkept fixed). A rectifier combines features (a) and (b). GaAs shows the\n\nfeature (c).\n\n11. When a source of emf ε is connected to an external resistance R, the\nvoltage V\n\next\n across R is given by\n\nV\next\n\n = IR = R\nR r\n\nε\n+\n\nwhere r is the internal resistance of the source.\n\n12.

The Wheatstone bridge is an arrangement of four resistances – R\n1\n, R\n\n2\n,\n\nR\n3\n, R\n\n4\n as shown in the text.

The potentiometer is a device to compare potential differences. Since\n\nthe method involves a condition of no current flow, the device can be\n\nused to measure potential difference; internal resistance of a cell and\n\ncompare emf’s of two sources.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n126\n\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n\n1. Current is a scalar although we represent current with an arrow.\n\nCurrents do not obey the  law of vector addition. That current is a\nscalar also follows from it’s  definition. The current I through an area\n\nof cross-section is given by the scalar product of two vectors:\n\nI =  j . ∆S\n\nwhere j and ∆S are vectors.\n2. Refer to V-I curves of a resistor and a diode as drawn in the text. A\n\nresistor obeys Ohm’s law while a diode does not. The assertion that\nV = IR is a statement of Ohm’s law is not true. This equation defines\n\nresistance and it may be applied to all conducting devices whether\n\nthey obey Ohm’s law or not. The Ohm’s law asserts that the plot of I\n\nversus V is linear i.e., R is independent of V.\n\nEquation E = ρ j leads to another statement of Ohm’s law, i.e., a\nconducting material obeys Ohm’s law when the resistivity of the\nmaterial does not depend on the magnitude and direction of applied\n\nelectric field.\n\n3. Homogeneous conductors like silver or semiconductors like pure\n\ngermanium or germanium containing impurities obey Ohm’s law\n\nwithin some range of electric field values.
