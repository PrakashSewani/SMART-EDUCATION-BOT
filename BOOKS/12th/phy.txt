Have\nyou ever tried to find any explanation for this phenomenon? Another\ncommon example of electric discharge is the lightning that we see in the\nsky during thunderstorms. We also experience a sensation of an electric\nshock either while opening the door of a car or holding the iron bar of a\nbus after sliding from our seat. The reason for these experiences is\ndischarge of electric charges through our body, which were accumulated\ndue to rubbing of insulating surfaces. You might have also heard that\nthis is due to generation of static electricity. This is precisely the topic we\nare going to discuss in this and the next chapter. Static means anything\nthat does not move or change with time. Electrostatics deals with the\nstudy of forces, fields and potentials arising from static charges.\n\n1.2  ELECTRIC CHARGE\nHistorically the credit of discovery of the fact that amber rubbed with\nwool or silk cloth attracts light objects goes to Thales of Miletus, Greece,\naround 600 BC. The name electricity is coined from the Greek word\nelektron meaning amber. Many such pairs of materials were known which\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n2\n\nPhysics\n\non rubbing could attract light objects\nlike straw, pith balls and bits of papers.\nYou can perform the following activity\nat home to experience such an effect.\nCut out long thin strips of white paper\nand lightly iron them. Take them near a\nTV screen or computer monitor. You will\nsee that the strips get attracted to the\nscreen. In fact they remain stuck to the\nscreen for a while.\n\nIt was observed that if two glass rods\nrubbed with wool or silk cloth are\nbrought close to each other, they repel\neach other [Fig. 1.1(a)]. The two strands\nof wool or two pieces of silk cloth, with\nwhich the rods were rubbed, also repel\neach other. However, the glass rod and\n\nwool attracted each other. Similarly, two plastic rods rubbed with cat’s\nfur repelled each other [Fig. 1.1(b)] but attracted the fur. On the other\nhand, the plastic rod attracts the glass rod [Fig. 1.1(c)] and repel the silk\nor wool with which the glass rod is rubbed. The glass rod repels the fur.\n\nIf a plastic rod rubbed with fur is made to touch two small pith balls\n(now-a-days we can use polystyrene balls) suspended by silk or nylon\nthread, then the balls repel each other [Fig. 1.1(d)] and are also repelled\nby the rod. A similar effect is found if the pith balls are touched with a\nglass rod rubbed with silk [Fig. 1.1(e)]. A dramatic observation is that a\npith ball touched with glass rod attracts another pith ball touched with\nplastic rod [Fig. 1.1(f )].\n\nThese seemingly simple facts were established from years of efforts\nand careful experiments and their analyses. It was concluded, after many\ncareful studies by different scientists, that there were only two kinds of\nan entity which is called the electric charge. We say that the bodies like\nglass or plastic rods, silk, fur and pith balls are electrified. They acquire\nan electric charge on rubbing. The experiments on pith balls suggested\nthat there are two kinds of electrification and we find  that (i) like charges\nrepel and (ii) unlike charges attract each other. The experiments also\ndemonstrated that the charges are transferred from the rods to the pith\nballs on  contact. It is said that the pith balls are electrified or are charged\nby  contact. The property which differentiates the two kinds of charges is\ncalled the polarity of charge.\n\nWhen a glass rod is rubbed with silk, the rod acquires one kind of\ncharge and the silk acquires the second kind of charge. This is true for\nany pair of objects that are rubbed to be electrified. Now if the electrified\nglass rod is brought in contact with silk, with which it was rubbed, they\nno longer attract each other. They also do not attract or repel other light\nobjects as they did on being electrified.\n\nThus, the charges acquired after rubbing are lost when the charged\nbodies are brought in contact. What can you conclude from these\nobservations? It just tells us that unlike charges acquired by the objects\n\nFIGURE 1.1 Rods and pith balls: like charges repel and\nunlike charges attract each other.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectric Charges\n\nand Fields\n\n3\n\nneutralise or nullify each other’s effect. Therefore, the charges were named\nas positive and negative by the American scientist Benjamin Franklin.\nWe know that when we add a positive number to a negative number of\nthe same magnitude, the sum is zero. This might have been the\nphilosophy in naming the charges as positive and negative. By convention,\nthe charge on glass rod or cat’s fur is called positive and that on plastic\nrod or silk is termed negative. If an object possesses an electric charge, it\nis said to be electrified or charged. When it has no charge it is said to be\nelectrically neutral.\n\nUNIFICATION OF ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM\n\nIn olden days, electricity and magnetism were treated as separate subjects. Electricity\ndealt with charges on glass rods, cat’s fur, batteries, lightning, etc., while magnetism\ndescribed interactions of magnets, iron filings, compass needles, etc. In 1820 Danish\nscientist Oersted found that a compass needle is deflected by passing an electric current\nthrough a wire placed near the needle. Ampere and Faraday supported this observation\nby saying that electric charges in motion produce magnetic fields and moving magnets\ngenerate electricity. The unification was achieved when the Scottish physicist Maxwell\nand the Dutch physicist Lorentz put forward a theory where they showed the\ninterdependence of these two subjects. This field is called electromagnetism. Most of the\nphenomena occurring around us can be described under electromagnetism. Virtually\nevery force that we can think of like friction, chemical force between atoms holding the\nmatter together, and even the forces describing processes occurring in cells of living\norganisms, have its origin in electromagnetic force. Electromagnetic force is one of the\nfundamental forces of nature.\n\nMaxwell put forth four equations that play the same role in classical electromagnetism\nas Newton’s equations of motion and gravitation law play in mechanics. He also argued\nthat light is electromagnetic in nature and its speed can be found by making purely\nelectric and magnetic measurements. He claimed that the science of optics is intimately\nrelated to that of electricity and magnetism.\n\nThe science of electricity and magnetism is the foundation for the modern technological\ncivilisation. Electric power, telecommunication, radio and television, and a wide variety\nof the practical appliances used in daily life are based on the principles of this science.\nAlthough charged particles in motion exert both electric and magnetic forces, in the\nframe of reference where all the charges are at rest, the forces are purely electrical. You\nknow that gravitational force is a long-range force. Its effect is felt even when the distance\nbetween the interacting particles is very large because the force decreases inversely as\nthe square of the distance between the interacting bodies. We will learn in this chapter\nthat electric force is also as pervasive and is in fact stronger than the gravitational force\nby several orders of magnitude (refer to Chapter 1 of Class XI Physics Textbook).\n\nA simple apparatus to detect charge on a body is the gold-leaf\nelectroscope [Fig. 1.2(a)]. It consists of a vertical metal rod housed in a\nbox, with two thin gold leaves attached to its bottom end. When a charged\nobject touches the metal knob at the top of the rod, charge flows on to\nthe leaves and they diverge. The degree of divergance is an indicator of\nthe amount of charge.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n4\n\nPhysics\n\nStudents can make a simple electroscope as\nfollows [Fig. 1.2(b)]: Take a thin aluminium curtain\nrod with ball ends fitted for hanging the curtain. Cut\nout a piece of length about 20 cm with the ball at\none end and flatten the cut end. Take a large bottle\nthat can hold this rod and a cork which will fit in the\nopening of the bottle. Make a hole in the cork\nsufficient to hold the curtain rod snugly. Slide the\nrod through the hole in the cork with the cut end on\nthe lower side and ball end projecting above the cork.\nFold a small, thin aluminium foil (about 6 cm in\nlength) in the middle and attach it to the flattened\nend of the rod by cellulose tape. This forms the leaves\nof your electroscope. Fit the cork in the bottle with\nabout 5 cm of the ball end projecting above the cork.\nA paper scale may be put inside the bottle in advance\nto measure the separation of leaves. The separation\nis a rough measure of the amount of charge on the\nelectroscope.\n\nTo understand how the electroscope works, use\nthe white paper strips we used for seeing the\nattraction of charged bodies. Fold the strips into half\nso that you make a mark of fold. Open the strip and\niron it lightly with the mountain fold up, as shown\nin Fig. 1.3. Hold the strip by pinching it at the fold.\nYou would notice that the two halves move apart.\n\nThis shows that the strip has acquired charge on ironing. When you fold\nit into half, both the halves have the same charge. Hence they repel each\nother. The same effect is seen in the leaf electroscope. On charging the\ncurtain rod by touching the ball end with an electrified body, charge is\ntransferred to the curtain rod and the attached aluminium foil. Both the\nhalves of the foil get similar charge and therefore repel each other. The\ndivergence in the leaves depends on the amount of charge on them. Let\nus first try to understand why material bodies acquire charge.\n\nYou know that all matter is made up of atoms and/or molecules.\nAlthough normally the materials are electrically neutral,  they do contain\ncharges; but their charges are exactly balanced. Forces that hold the\nmolecules together, forces that hold atoms together in a solid, the adhesive\nforce of glue, forces associated with surface tension, all are basically\nelectrical in nature, arising from the forces between charged particles.\nThus the electric force is all pervasive and it encompasses almost each\nand every field associated with our life. It is therefore  essential that we\nlearn more about such a force.\n\nTo electrify a neutral body, we need to add or remove one kind of\ncharge. When we say that a body is charged, we always refer to this\nexcess charge or deficit of charge. In solids,  some of the electrons, being\nless tightly bound in the atom, are the charges which are transferred\nfrom one body to the other.  A body can thus be charged positively by\nlosing some of its electrons. Similarly, a body can be charged negatively\n\nFIGURE 1.2 Electroscopes: (a) The gold leaf\nelectroscope, (b) Schematics of a simple\n\nelectroscope.\n\nFIGURE 1.3 Paper strip\nexperiment.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectric Charges\n\nand Fields\n\n5\n\nby gaining electrons. When we rub a glass rod with silk, some of the\nelectrons from the rod are transferred to the silk cloth. Thus the rod gets\npositively charged and the silk gets negatively charged. No new charge is\ncreated in the process of rubbing. Also the number of electrons, that are\ntransferred, is a very small fraction of the total number of electrons in the\nmaterial body. Also only the less tightly bound electrons in a material\nbody can be transferred from it to another by rubbing. Therefore, when\na body is rubbed with another, the bodies get charged and that is why\nwe have to stick to certain pairs of materials to notice charging on rubbing\nthe bodies.\n\n1.3  CONDUCTORS AND INSULATORS\nA metal rod held in hand and rubbed with wool will not show any sign of\nbeing charged. However, if a metal rod with a wooden or plastic handle is\nrubbed without touching its metal part, it shows signs of charging.\nSuppose we connect one end of a copper wire to a neutral pith ball and\nthe other end to a negatively charged plastic rod. We will find that the\npith ball acquires a negative charge. If a similar experiment is repeated\nwith a nylon thread or a rubber band, no transfer of charge will take\nplace from the plastic rod to the pith ball. Why does the transfer of charge\nnot take place from the rod to the ball?\n\nSome substances readily allow passage of electricity through them,\nothers do not.  Those which allow electricity to pass through them easily\nare called conductors. They have electric charges (electrons) that are\ncomparatively free to move inside the material. Metals, human and animal\nbodies and earth are conductors. Most of the non-metals like glass,\nporcelain, plastic, nylon, wood offer high resistance to the passage of\nelectricity through them. They are called insulators. Most  substances\nfall into one of the two classes stated above*.\n\nWhen some charge is transferred to a conductor, it readily gets\ndistributed over the entire surface of the conductor. In contrast, if some\ncharge is put on an insulator, it stays at the same place. You will learn\nwhy this happens in the next chapter.\n\nThis property of the materials tells you why a nylon or plastic comb\ngets electrified on combing dry hair or on rubbing, but a metal article\nlike spoon does not. The charges on metal leak through our body to the\nground as both are conductors of electricity.\n\n  When we bring a charged body  in contact with the earth,  all the\nexcess charge on the body disappears by causing a momentary current\nto pass to the ground through the connecting conductor (such as our\nbody). This process of sharing the charges with the earth is called\ngrounding or earthing. Earthing provides a safety measure for electrical\ncircuits and appliances. A thick metal plate is buried deep into the earth\nand thick wires are drawn from this plate; these are  used in buildings\nfor the purpose of earthing near the mains supply.  The electric wiring in\nour houses has three wires: live, neutral and earth. The first two carry\n\n* There is a third category called semiconductors, which offer resistance to the\nmovement of charges which is intermediate between the conductors and\ninsulators.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n6\n\nPhysics\n\nelectric current from the power station and the third is earthed by\nconnecting it to the buried metal plate. Metallic bodies of the electric\nappliances such as electric iron, refrigerator, TV are connected to the\nearth wire. When any fault occurs or live wire touches the metallic body,\nthe charge flows to the earth without damaging the appliance and without\ncausing any injury to the humans; this  would have otherwise been\nunavoidable since  the human body is a  conductor of electricity.\n\n1.4  CHARGING BY INDUCTION\nWhen we touch a pith ball with an electrified plastic rod, some of the\nnegative charges on the rod are transferred to the pith ball and it also\ngets charged. Thus the pith ball is charged by contact. It is then repelled\nby the plastic rod but is attracted by a glass rod which is oppositely\ncharged. However, why a electrified rod attracts light objects, is  a  question\nwe have still left unanswered. Let us try to understand what could be\nhappening by performing the following experiment.\n(i) Bring two metal spheres, A and B, supported on insulating stands,\n\nin contact as shown in Fig. 1.4(a).\n(ii) Bring a positively charged rod near one of the spheres, say A, taking\n\ncare that it does not touch the sphere. The free electrons in the spheres\nare attracted towards the rod. This leaves an excess of positive charge\non the rear surface of sphere B. Both kinds of charges are bound in\nthe metal spheres and cannot escape. They, therefore, reside on the\nsurfaces, as shown in Fig. 1.4(b). The left surface of sphere A, has an\nexcess of negative charge and the right surface of sphere B, has an\nexcess of positive charge. However, not all of the electrons in the spheres\nhave accumulated on the left surface of A. As the negative charge\nstarts building up at the left surface of A, other electrons are repelled\nby these. In a short time, equilibrium is reached under the action of\nforce of attraction of the rod and the force of repulsion due to the\naccumulated charges. Fig. 1.4(b) shows the equilibrium situation.\nThe process is called induction of charge and happens almost\ninstantly. The accumulated charges remain on the surface, as shown,\ntill the glass rod is held near the sphere. If the rod is removed, the\ncharges are not acted by any outside force and they redistribute to\ntheir original neutral state.\n\n(iii) Separate the spheres by a small distance while the glass rod is still\nheld near sphere A, as shown in Fig. 1.4(c). The two spheres are found\nto be oppositely charged and attract each other.\n\n(iv) Remove the rod. The charges on spheres rearrange themselves as\nshown in Fig. 1.4(d). Now, separate the spheres quite apart. The\ncharges on them get uniformly distributed over them, as shown in\nFig. 1.4(e).\nIn this process, the metal spheres will each be equal and oppositely\n\ncharged. This is charging by induction. The positively charged glass rod\ndoes not lose any of its charge, contrary to the process of charging by\ncontact.\n\nWhen electrified rods are brought near light objects, a similar effect\ntakes place. The rods induce opposite charges on the near surfaces of\nthe objects and similar charges move to the farther side of the object.\n\nFIGURE 1.4 Charging\nby induction.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectric Charges\n\nand Fields\n\n7\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n.1\n\n[This happens even when the light object is not a conductor. The\nmechanism for how this happens is explained later in Sections 1.10 and\n2.10.] The centres of the two types of charges are slightly separated. We\nknow that opposite charges attract while similar charges repel. However,\nthe magnitude of force depends on the distance between the charges\nand in this case the force of attraction overweighs the force of repulsion.\nAs a result the particles like bits of paper or pith balls, being light, are\npulled towards the rods.\n\nExample 1.1 How can you charge a metal sphere positively without\ntouching it?\n\nSolution Figure 1.5(a) shows an uncharged metallic sphere on an\ninsulating metal stand. Bring a negatively charged rod close to the\nmetallic sphere, as shown in Fig. 1.5(b). As the rod is brought close\nto the sphere, the free electrons in the sphere move away due to\nrepulsion and start piling up at the farther end. The near end becomes\npositively charged due to deficit of electrons. This process of charge\ndistribution stops when the net force on the free electrons inside the\nmetal is zero. Connect the sphere to the ground by a conducting\nwire. The electrons will flow to the ground while the positive charges\nat the near end will remain held there due to the attractive force of\nthe negative charges on the rod, as shown in Fig. 1.5(c). Disconnect\nthe sphere from the ground. The positive charge continues to be\nheld at the near end [Fig. 1.5(d)]. Remove the electrified rod. The\npositive charge will spread uniformly over the sphere as shown in\nFig. 1.5(e).\n\nFIGURE 1.5\n\nIn this experiment, the metal sphere gets charged by the process\nof induction and the rod does not lose any of its charge.\n\nSimilar steps are involved in charging a metal sphere negatively\nby induction, by bringing a positively charged rod near it. In this\ncase the electrons will flow from the ground to the sphere when the\nsphere is connected to the ground with a wire.

Here,  we shall now\ndescribe some other properties of the electric charge.\n\nIf the sizes of charged bodies are very small as compared to the\ndistances between them, we treat them as point charges. All the\ncharge content of the body is assumed to be concentrated at one point\nin space.\n\n1.5.1  Additivity of charges\n\nWe have not as yet given a quantitative definition of a charge; we shall\nfollow it up in the next section. We shall tentatively assume that this can\nbe done and proceed. If a system contains two point charges q\n\n1\n and q\n\n2\n,\n\nthe total charge of the system is obtained simply by adding algebraically\nq\n\n1\n and q\n\n2 \n,\n \ni.e., charges add up like real numbers or they are scalars like\n\nthe mass of a body. If a system contains n charges q1, q2, q3, …, qn, then\nthe total charge of the system is q\n\n1\n + q\n\n2\n + q\n\n3\n + … + q\n\nn \n.  Charge has\n\nmagnitude but no direction, similar to mass. However, there is one\ndifference between mass and charge. Mass of a body is always positive\nwhereas a charge can be either positive or negative. Proper signs have to\nbe used while adding the charges in a system. For example, the\ntotal charge of a system containing five charges +1, +2, –3, +4 and –5,\nin some arbitrary unit, is (+1) + (+2) + (–3) + (+4) + (–5) = –1 in the\nsame unit.\n\n1.5.2  Charge is conserved\n\nWe have already  hinted to the fact that when bodies are charged by\nrubbing, there is transfer of electrons from one body to the other; no new\ncharges are either created or destroyed. A picture of particles of electric\ncharge enables us to understand the idea of conservation of charge. When\nwe rub two bodies, what one body gains in charge the other body loses.\nWithin an isolated system consisting of many charged bodies, due to\ninteractions among the bodies, charges may get redistributed but it is\nfound that the total charge of the isolated system is always conserved.\nConservation of charge has been established experimentally.\n\nIt is not possible to create or destroy net charge carried by any isolated\nsystem although the charge carrying particles may be created or destroyed\nin a process. Sometimes nature creates charged particles: a neutron turns\ninto a proton and an electron. The proton and electron thus created have\nequal and opposite charges and the total charge is zero before and after\nthe creation.\n\n1.5.3  Quantisation of charge\n\nExperimentally it is established that all free charges are integral multiples\nof a basic unit of charge denoted by e. Thus charge q on a body is always\ngiven by\n\nq = ne\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectric Charges\n\nand Fields\n\n9\n\nwhere n is any integer, positive or negative. This basic unit of charge is the\ncharge that an electron or proton carries. By convention, the charge on an\nelectron is taken to be negative; therefore charge on an electron is written\nas –e and that on a proton as +e.\n\nThe fact that electric charge is always an integral multiple of e is termed\nas quantisation of charge. There are a large number of situations in physics\nwhere certain physical quantities are quantised. The quantisation of charge\nwas first suggested by the experimental laws of electrolysis discovered by\nEnglish experimentalist Faraday. It was experimentally demonstrated by\nMillikan in 1912.\n\nIn the International System (SI) of Units, a unit of charge is called a\ncoulomb and is denoted by the symbol C. A coulomb is defined in terms\nthe unit of the electric current which you are going to learn in a subsequent\nchapter. In terms of this definition, one coulomb is the charge flowing\nthrough a wire in 1 s if the current is 1 A (ampere), (see Chapter 2 of Class\nXI, Physics Textbook , Part I). In this system, the value of the basic unit of\ncharge is\n\ne = 1.602192 × 10–19 C\n\nThus, there are about 6 × 1018 electrons in a charge of  –1C. In\nelectrostatics, charges of this large magnitude are seldom encountered\nand hence we use smaller units 1 µC (micro coulomb) = 10–6 C or 1 mC\n(milli coulomb) = 10–3 C.\n\nIf the protons and electrons are the only basic charges in the universe,\nall the observable charges have to be integral multiples of e. Thus, if a\nbody contains n\n\n1\n electrons and n\n\n2\n protons, the total amount of charge on\n\nthe body is n\n2\n × e + n\n\n1\n × (–e) = (n\n\n2\n – n\n\n1\n) e. Since n\n\n1\n and n\n\n2\n are integers, their\n\ndifference is also an integer. Thus the charge on any body is always an\nintegral multiple of e and can be increased or decreased also in steps of e.\n\nThe step size e is, however, very small because at the macroscopic\nlevel, we deal with charges of a few µC. At this scale the fact that charge of\na body can increase or decrease in units of e is not visible. In this respect,\nthe grainy nature of the charge is lost and it appears to be continuous.\n\nThis situation can be compared with the geometrical concepts of points\nand lines. A dotted line viewed from a distance appears continuous to\nus but is not continuous in reality. As many points very close to\neach other normally give an impression of a continuous line, many\nsmall charges taken together appear as a continuous charge\ndistribution.\n\nAt the macroscopic level, one deals with charges that are enormous\ncompared to the magnitude of charge e. Since e = 1.6 × 10–19 C, a charge\nof magnitude, say 1 µC, contains something like 1013 times the electronic\ncharge. At this scale, the fact that charge can increase or decrease only in\nunits of e is not very different from saying that charge can take continuous\nvalues. Thus, at the macroscopic level, the quantisation of charge has no\npractical consequence and can be ignored. However, at the microscopic\nlevel, where the charges involved are of the order of a few tens or hundreds\nof e, i.e., they can be counted, they appear in discrete lumps and\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n10\n\nPhysics\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n.3\n E\n\nX\nA\n\nM\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n.2\n\nquantisation of charge cannot be ignored. It is the magnitude of scale\ninvolved that is very important.\n\nExample 1.2 If 109 electrons move out of a body to another body\nevery second, how much time is required to get a total charge of 1 C\non the other body?\n\nSolution In one second 109 electrons move out of the body. Therefore\nthe charge given out in one second is 1.6 × 10–19 × 109 C = 1.6 × 10–10 C.\nThe time required to accumulate a charge of 1 C can then be estimated\nto be 1 C ÷ (1.6 × 10–10 C/s) = 6.25 × 109 s = 6.25 × 109 ÷ (365  × 24 ×\n3600) years = 198 years. Thus to collect a charge of one coulomb,\nfrom a body from which 109 electrons move out every second, we will\nneed approximately 200 years. One coulomb is, therefore, a very large\nunit for many practical purposes.\nIt is, however, also important to know what is roughly the number of\nelectrons contained in a piece of one cubic centimetre of a material.\nA cubic piece of copper of side 1 cm contains about 2.5 × 1024\n\nelectrons.\n\nExample 1.3 How much positive and negative charge is there in a\ncup of water?\n\nSolution Let us assume that the mass of one cup of water is\n250 g. The molecular mass of water is 18g. Thus, one mole\n(= 6.02 × 1023 molecules) of water is 18 g. Therefore the number of\nmolecules in one cup of water is (250/18) × 6.02 × 1023.\nEach molecule of water contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen\natom, i.e., 10 electrons and 10 protons. Hence the total positive and\ntotal negative charge has the same magnitude. It is equal to\n(250/18) × 6.02 × 1023 × 10 × 1.6 × 10–19 C = 1.34 × 107 C.\n\n1.6  COULOMB’S LAW\nCoulomb’s law is a quantitative statement about the force between two\npoint charges. When the linear size of charged bodies are much smaller\nthan the distance separating them, the size may be ignored and the\ncharged bodies are treated as point charges. Coulomb measured the\nforce between two point charges and found that it varied inversely as\nthe square of the distance between the charges and was directly\n\nproportional to the product of the magnitude of the two charges and\n\nacted along the line joining the two charges. Thus, if two point charges\nq1, q2 are separated by a distance r in vacuum, the magnitude of the\nforce (F) between them is given by\n\n21\n2\n\nq q\nF k\n\nr\n= (1.1)\n\nHow did Coulomb arrive at this law from his experiments? Coulomb\nused a torsion balance*  for measuring the force between two charged metallic\n\n* A torsion balance is a sensitive device to measure force. It was also used later\nby Cavendish to measure the very feeble gravitational force between two objects,\nto verify Newton’s Law of Gravitation.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectric Charges\n\nand Fields\n\n11\n\nspheres. When the separation between two spheres is much\nlarger than the radius of each sphere, the charged spheres\nmay be regarded as point charges. However, the charges\non the spheres were unknown, to begin with. How then\ncould he discover a relation like Eq. (1.1)? Coulomb\nthought of the following simple way: Suppose the charge\non a metallic sphere is q. If the sphere is put in contact\nwith an identical uncharged sphere, the charge will spread\nover the two spheres. By symmetry, the charge on each\nsphere will be q/2*. Repeating this process, we can get\ncharges q/2, q/4, etc. Coulomb varied the distance for a\nfixed pair of charges and measured the force for different\nseparations. He then varied the charges in pairs, keeping\nthe distance fixed for each pair. Comparing forces for\ndifferent pairs of charges at different distances, Coulomb\narrived at the relation, Eq. (1.1).\n\nCoulomb’s law, a simple mathematical statement,\nwas initially experimentally arrived at  in the manner\ndescribed above. While the original experiments\nestablished it at a macroscopic scale, it has also been\nestablished down to subatomic level  (r ~ 10–10 m).\n\nCoulomb discovered his law without knowing the\nexplicit magnitude of the charge. In fact, it is the other\nway round: Coulomb’s law can now be employed to\nfurnish a definition for a unit of charge. In the relation,\nEq. (1.1), k is so far arbitrary. We can choose any positive\nvalue of k. The choice of k determines the size of the unit\nof charge. In SI units, the value of k is about 9 × 109\n\n2\n\n2\n\nNm\nC\n\n. The unit of charge that results from this choice is\n\ncalled a coulomb which we defined earlier in Section\n1.4. Putting this value of k in Eq. (1.1), we see that for\nq1 = q2 = 1 C, r = 1 m\n\nF = 9 × 109 N\nThat is, 1 C is the charge that when placed at a\n\ndistance of 1 m from another charge of the same\nmagnitude in vacuum experiences an electrical force of\nrepulsion of magnitude 9 × 109 N. One coulomb is\nevidently too big a unit to be used. In practice, in\nelectrostatics, one uses smaller units like 1 mC or 1 µC.\n\nThe constant k in Eq. (1.1) is usually put as\nk = 1/4πε\n\n0\n for later convenience, so that Coulomb’s law is written as\n\n0\n\n1 2\n2\n\n1\n4\n\nq q\nF\n\nrε\n=\n\nπ\n(1.2)\n\nε0 is called the permittivity of free space . The value of ε0 in SI units is\n\n0\nε = 8.854 × 10–12 C2 N–1m–2\n\n* Implicit in this is the assumption of additivity of charges and conservation:\ntwo charges (q/2 each) add up to make a total charge q.\n\nCharles Augustin de\nCoulomb (1736 – 1806)\n\nCoulomb, a French\nphysicist, began his career\nas a military engineer in\nthe West Indies. In 1776, he\nreturned to Paris and\nretired to a small estate to\ndo his scientific research.\nHe invented a torsion\nbalance to measure the\nquantity of a force and used\nit for determination of\nforces of electric attraction\nor repulsion between small\ncharged spheres. He thus\narrived in 1785 at the\ninverse square law relation,\nnow known as Coulomb’s\nlaw. The law had been\nanticipated by Priestley and\nalso by Cavendish earlier,\nthough Cavendish never\npublished his results.\nCoulomb also found the\ninverse square law of force\nbetween unlike and like\nmagnetic poles.\n\nC\nH\n\nA\nR\n\nL\nE\n\nS\n A\n\nU\nG\n\nU\nS\n\nT\nIN\n\n D\nE\n\n C\nO\n\nU\nL\nO\n\nM\nB\n\n  (1\n7\n3\n6\n –1\n\n8\n0\n6\n)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n12\n\nPhysics\n\nSince force is a vector, it is better to write\nCoulomb’s law in the vector notation. Let the\nposition vectors of charges q\n\n1\n and q\n\n2\n be r\n\n1\n and r\n\n2\nrespectively [see Fig.1.6(a)]. We denote force on\nq\n\n1\n due to q\n\n2\n by F\n\n12\n and force on q\n\n2\n due to q\n\n1\n by\n\nF\n21\n\n. The two point charges q\n1\n and q\n\n2\n have been\n\nnumbered 1 and 2 for convenience and the vector\nleading from 1 to 2 is denoted by r\n\n21\n:\n\nr\n21\n\n = r\n2\n – r\n\n1\n\nIn the same way, the vector leading from 2 to\n1 is denoted by r\n\n12\n:\n\nr\n12\n\n = r\n1\n – r\n\n2\n = – r\n\n21\n\nThe magnitude of the vectors r\n21\n\n and r\n12\n\n is\ndenoted by r\n\n21 \nand r\n\n12\n,\n \nrespectively (r\n\n12 \n= r\n\n21\n). The\n\ndirection of a vector is specified by a unit vector\nalong the vector. To denote the direction from 1\nto 2 (or from 2 to 1), we define the unit vectors:\n\n$ 21\n21\n\n21\n\n=\nr\n\nr\nr\n\n, \n$ $ $12\n12 21 12\n\n12\n\n,= −\nr\n\nr r r\nr\n\nCoulomb’s force law between two point charges q1 and q2 located at\nr1 and r2, respectively is then expressed as\n\n$1 2\n2121 2\n\n21\n\n1\n4 ε\n\n=\nπ\n\nF r\no\n\nq q\n\nr\n(1.3)\n\nSome remarks on Eq. (1.3) are relevant:\n\n• Equation (1.3) is valid for any sign of q\n1\n and q\n\n2\n whether positive or\n\nnegative. If q1 and q2 are of the same sign (either both positive or both\nnegative), F21 is along r̂ 21, which denotes repulsion, as it should be for\n\nlike charges. If q\n1\n and q\n\n2\n are of opposite signs, F\n\n21\n is along – $r 21(= $r 12),\n\nwhich denotes attraction, as expected for unlike charges. Thus, we do\nnot have to write separate equations for the cases of like and unlike\ncharges. Equation (1.3) takes care of both cases correctly [Fig. 1.6(b)].\n\n• The force F\n12\n\n  on charge q\n1\n due to charge q\n\n2\n, is obtained from Eq. (1.3),\n\nby simply interchanging 1 and 2, i.e.,\n\n1 2\n12 12 212\n\n0 12\n\n1\nˆ\n\n4 ε\n= = −\n\nπ\nF r F\n\nq q\n\nr\n\nThus, Coulomb’s law agrees with the Newton’s third law.\n\n• Coulomb’s law [Eq. (1.3)] gives the force between two charges q\n1\n and\n\nq2 in vacuum. If the charges are placed in matter or the intervening\nspace has matter, the situation gets complicated due to the presence\nof charged constituents of matter. We shall consider electrostatics in\nmatter in the next chapter.\n\nFIGURE 1.6 (a) Geometry and\n(b) Forces between charges.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectric Charges\n\nand Fields\n\n13\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n.4\n\nExample 1.4 Coulomb’s law for electrostatic force between two point\ncharges and Newton’s law for gravitational force between two\nstationary point masses, both have inverse-square dependence on\nthe distance between the charges and masses respectively.\n(a) Compare the strength of these forces by determining the ratio of\ntheir magnitudes (i) for an electron and a proton and (ii) for two\nprotons.

How to calculate the force on a\ncharge where there are not one but several charges\naround? Consider a system of n stationary charges\nq1, q2, q3, ..., qn in vacuum. What is the force on q1 due\nto q\n\n2\n, q\n\n3\n, ..., q\n\nn\n? Coulomb’s law is not enough to answer\n\nthis question.  Recall that forces of mechanical origin\nadd according to the parallelogram law of addition. Is\nthe same true for forces of electrostatic origin?\n\nExperimentally, it is verified that force on any\ncharge due to a number of other charges is the vector\nsum of all the forces on that charge due to the other\ncharges, taken one at a time. The individual forces\n\nare unaffected due to the presence of other charges.\nThis is termed as the principle of superposition.\n\nTo better understand the concept, consider a\nsystem of three charges q1, q2 and q3, as shown in\nFig. 1.8(a). The force on one charge, say q\n\n1\n, due to two\n\nother charges q\n2\n, q\n\n3\n can therefore be obtained by\n\nperforming a vector addition of the forces due to each\none of these charges. Thus, if the force on q\n\n1\n due to q\n\n2\nis denoted by F\n\n12\n, F\n\n12\n is given by Eq. (1.3)  even though\n\nother charges are present.\n\nThus, F12 =\n1\n\n4 0\n1 2\n\n12\n2 12\n\nπε\n\nq q\n\nr\nr̂\n\nIn the same way, the force on q1 due to q3, denoted\nby F\n\n13\n, is given by\n\nF r13\n0\n\n1 3\n\n13\n2 13\n\n1\n4\n\n=\nπε\n\nq q\n\nr\nˆ\n\nFIGURE 1.8 A system of (a) three\ncharges (b) multiple charges.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n16\n\nPhysics\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n.6\n\nwhich again is the Coulomb force on q\n1\n due to q\n\n3\n, even though other\n\ncharge q\n2\n is present.\n\nThus the total force F1 on q1 due to the two charges q2 and q3 is\ngiven as\n\nF F F r r1 12 13\n0\n\n1 2\n\n12\n2 12\n\n0\n\n1 3\n\n13\n2 13\n\n1\n4\n\n1\n4\n\n= + = +\nπ πε ε\n\nq q\n\nr\n\nq q\n\nr\nˆ ˆ (1.4)\n\nThe above calculation of force can be generalised to a system of\ncharges more than three, as shown in Fig. 1.8(b).\n\nThe principle of superposition says that in a system of charges q1,\nq\n\n2\n, ..., q\n\nn\n, the force on q\n\n1\n due to q\n\n2\n is the same as given by Coulomb’s law,\n\ni.e., it is unaffected by the presence of the other charges q\n3\n, q\n\n4\n, ..., q\n\nn\n. The\n\ntotal force F1 on the charge q1, due to all other charges, is then given by\nthe vector sum of the forces F\n\n12\n, F\n\n13\n, ...,  F\n\n1n\n:\n\ni.e.,\n\nF F F F r r1 12 13 1n =   +  + ...+  = +\n1\n\n4 0\n1 2\n\n12\n2 12\n\n1 3\n\n13\n2 13πε\n\nq q\n\nr\n\nq q\n\nr\nˆ ˆ ++ +\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ef\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8fb\n\uf8fa... ˆ\n\nq q\n\nr\n\nn\n\nn\n\nn\n1\n\n1\n2 1\n\nr\n\n=\n=\n\n∑\nq q\n\nr\n\ni\n\nii\n\nn\n\ni\n1\n\n0 1\n2\n\n2\n14πε\nr̂ (1.5)\n\nThe vector sum is obtained as usual by the parallelogram law of\naddition of vectors.

By the parallelogram law, the total force F1 on the charge\nq at A is given by\n\nF1 = F 1̂r  where 1̂r  is a unit vector along BC.\nThe force of attraction or repulsion for each pair of charges has the\n\nsame magnitude F\nq\n\n=\n2\n\n0\n24 π ε l\n\nThe total force F2 on charge q at B is thus F2 = F r̂ 2, where r̂ 2 is a\nunit vector along AC.\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n.7\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n18\n\nPhysics\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n.7\n\nSimilarly the total force on charge –q at C is F3  = 3  F n̂ , where n̂ is\nthe unit vector along the direction bisecting the ∠BCA.\nIt is interesting to see that the sum of the forces on the three charges\nis zero, i.e.,\n\nF1 + F2 + F3 = 0\n\nThe result is not at all surprising. It follows straight from the fact\nthat Coulomb’s law is consistent with Newton’s third law. The proof\nis left to you as an exercise.\n\n1.8  ELECTRIC FIELD\nLet us consider a point charge Q placed in vacuum, at the origin O. If we\nplace another point charge q at a point P, where OP = r, then the charge Q\nwill exert a force on q as per Coulomb’s law. We may ask the question: If\ncharge q is removed, then what is left in the surrounding? Is there\nnothing? If there is nothing at the point P, then how does a force act\nwhen we place the charge q at P. In order to answer such questions, the\nearly scientists introduced the concept of field. According to this, we say\nthat the charge Q produces an electric field everywhere in the surrounding.\nWhen another charge q is brought at some point P, the field there acts on\nit and produces a force. The electric field produced by the charge Q  at a\npoint r is given as\n\nE r r r( ) = =\n1\n\n4\n1\n\n40\n2\n\n0\n2\n\nπ πε ε\n\nQ\n\nr\n\nQ\n\nr\nˆ ˆ (1.6)\n\nwhere ˆ =r  r/r, is a unit vector from the origin to the point r. Thus, Eq.(1.6)\nspecifies the value of the electric field for each value of the position\nvector r. The word “field” signifies how some distributed quantity (which\ncould be a scalar or a vector) varies with position. The effect of the charge\nhas been incorporated in the existence of the electric field. We obtain the\nforce F\n\n \nexerted by a\n\n \ncharge Q on a charge q, as\n\nF r=\n1\n\n4 0\n2\n\nπε\n\nQq\n\nr\nˆ (1.7)\n\nNote that the charge q also exerts an equal and opposite force on the\ncharge Q. The electrostatic force between the charges Q and q can be\nlooked upon as an interaction between charge q and the electric field of\nQ and vice versa. If we denote the position of charge q by the vector r, it\nexperiences a force F equal to the charge q multiplied by the electric\nfield E at the location of q. Thus,\n\nF(r) = q E(r) (1.8)\nEquation (1.8) defines the SI unit of electric field as N/C*.\nSome important remarks may be made here:\n\n(i) From Eq. (1.8), we can infer that if q is unity, the electric field due to\na charge Q is numerically equal to the force exerted by it. Thus, the\nelectric field due to a charge Q at a point in space may be defined\nas the force that a unit positive charge would experience if placed\n\n* An alternate unit V/m will be introduced in the next chapter.\n\nFIGURE 1.11 Electric\nfield (a) due to a\n\ncharge Q, (b) due to a\ncharge –Q.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectric Charges\n\nand Fields\n\n19\n\nat that point. The charge Q, which is producing the electric field, is\ncalled a source charge and the charge q, which tests the effect of a\nsource charge, is called a test charge. Note that the source charge Q\nmust remain at its original location. However, if a charge q is brought\nat any point around Q, Q itself is bound to experience an electrical\nforce due to q and will tend to move. A way out of this difficulty is to\nmake q negligibly small. The force F is then negligibly small but the\nratio F/q is finite and defines the electric field:\n\nE\nF\n\n=\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8\uf8f7→\nlim\nq q0\n\n(1.9)\n\nA practical way to get around the problem (of keeping Q undisturbed\nin the presence of q) is to hold Q to its location by unspecified forces!\nThis may look strange but actually this is what happens in practice.\nWhen we are considering the electric force on a test charge q due to a\ncharged planar sheet (Section 1.15), the charges on the sheet are held to\ntheir locations by the forces due to the unspecified charged constituents\ninside the sheet.\n(ii) Note that the electric field E due to Q, though defined operationally\n\nin terms of some test charge q, is independent of q. This is because\nF is proportional to q, so the ratio F/q does not depend on q. The\nforce F on the charge q due to the charge Q depends on the particular\nlocation of charge q which may take any value in the space around\nthe charge Q. Thus, the electric field E due to Q is also dependent on\nthe space coordinate r. For different positions of the charge q all over\nthe space, we get different values of electric field E. The field exists at\nevery point in three-dimensional space.\n\n(iii) For a positive charge, the electric field will be directed radially\noutwards from the charge. On the other hand, if the source charge is\nnegative, the electric field vector, at each point, points radially inwards.\n\n(iv) Since the magnitude of the force F on charge q due to charge Q\ndepends only on the distance r of the charge q from charge Q,\nthe magnitude of the electric field E will also depend only on the\ndistance r. Thus at equal distances from the charge Q, the magnitude\nof its electric field E is same. The magnitude of electric field E due to\na point charge is thus same on a sphere with the point charge at its\ncentre; in other words, it has a spherical symmetry.\n\n1.8.1  Electric field due to a system of charges\n\nConsider a system of charges q\n1\n, q\n\n2\n, ..., q\n\nn\n with  position vectors r\n\n1\n,\n\nr\n2\n, ..., r\n\nn\n relative  to some origin O. Like the electric field at a point in\n\nspace due to a single charge, electric field at a point in space due to the\nsystem of charges is defined to be the force experienced by a unit\ntest charge placed at that point, without disturbing the original\npositions of charges q\n\n1\n, q\n\n2\n, ..., q\n\nn\n. We can use Coulomb’s law and the\n\nsuperposition principle to determine this field at a point P denoted by\nposition vector r.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n20\n\nPhysics\n\nElectric field E\n1\n at r due to q\n\n1\n at r\n\n1\n is given by\n\nE1 = \n1\n\n4\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\nπε\n\nq\n\nr\nP\n\n1P\nr̂\n\nwhere 1Pr̂  is a unit vector in the direction from q1 to P,\nand r\n\n1P\n is the distance between q\n\n1\n and P.\n\nIn the same manner, electric field E2 at r due to q2 at\nr2 is\n\nE\n2\n = \n\n1\n4\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\nπε\n\nq\n\nr\nP\n\n2P\nr̂\n\nwhere 2Pr̂  is a unit vector in the direction from q2 to P\nand r\n\n2P\n is the distance between q\n\n2\n and P. Similar\n\nexpressions hold good for fields E\n3\n, E\n\n4\n, ..., E\n\nn\n due to\n\ncharges q3, q4, ..., qn.\nBy the superposition principle, the electric field E at r\ndue to the system of charges is (as shown in Fig. 1.12)\n\nE(r)  =  E1 (r) +  E2 (r)  + …  +  En(r)\n\n        =\n1\n\n4\n1\n\n4\n1\n\n40\n1\n\n1\n2 1\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2\n2 2\n\n0\n2\n\nπ π πε ε ε\n\nq\n\nr\n\nq\n\nr\n\nq\n\nr\n\nn\n\nn\n\nn\n\nP\nP\n\nP\nP\n\nP\nPˆ ˆ ... ˆr r r+ + +\n\nE(r) =\n=\n\n∑ \n1\n\n4 0 P\ni P\n\nπε\n\nq\n\nr\n\ni\n\nii\n\nn\n\n2\n1\n\nr̂ (1.10)\n\nE is a vector quantity that varies from one point to another point in space\nand is determined from the positions of the source charges.\n\n1.8.2  Physical significance of electric field\n\nYou may wonder why the notion of electric field has been introduced\nhere at all. After all, for any system of charges, the measurable quantity\nis the force on a charge which can be directly determined using Coulomb’s\nlaw and the superposition principle [Eq. (1.5)]. Why then introduce this\nintermediate quantity called the electric field?\n\nFor electrostatics, the concept of electric field is convenient, but not\nreally necessary. Electric field is an elegant way of characterising the\nelectrical environment of a system of charges. Electric field at a point in\nthe space around a system of charges tells you the force a unit positive\ntest charge would experience if placed at that point (without disturbing\nthe system). Electric field is a characteristic of the system of charges and\nis independent of the test charge that you place at a point to determine\nthe field. The term field in physics generally refers to a quantity that is\ndefined at every point in space and may vary from point to point. Electric\nfield is a vector field, since force is a vector quantity.\n\nThe true physical significance of the concept of electric field, however,\nemerges only when we go beyond electrostatics and deal with time-\ndependent electromagnetic phenomena. Suppose we consider the force\nbetween two distant charges q1, q2 in accelerated motion. Now the greatest\nspeed with which a signal or information can go from one point to another\nis c, the speed of light. Thus, the effect of any motion of q\n\n1\n on q\n\n2\n cannot\n\nFIGURE 1.12 Electric field at a\npoint due to a system of charges is\nthe vector sum of the electric fields\n\nat the point due to individual\ncharges.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectric Charges\n\nand Fields\n\n21\n\narise instantaneously. There will be some time delay between the effect\n(force on q\n\n2\n) and the cause (motion of q\n\n1\n). It is precisely here that the\n\nnotion of electric field (strictly, electromagnetic field) is natural and very\nuseful. The field picture is this: the accelerated motion of charge q\n\n1\nproduces electromagnetic waves, which then propagate with the speed\n\nc, reach q2 and cause a force on q2. The notion of field elegantly accounts\nfor the time delay. Thus, even though electric and magnetic fields can be\ndetected only by their effects (forces) on charges, they are regarded as\nphysical entities, not merely mathematical constructs. They have an\nindependent dynamics of their own,  i.e., they evolve according to laws\nof their own. They can also transport energy. Thus, a source of time-\ndependent electromagnetic fields, turned on for a short interval of time\nand then switched off, leaves behind propagating electromagnetic fields\ntransporting energy. The concept of field was first introduced by Faraday\nand is now among the central concepts in physics.\n\nExample 1.8 An electron falls through a distance of 1.5 cm in a\nuniform electric field of magnitude 2.0 × 104 N C–1 [Fig. 1.13(a)]. The\ndirection of the field is reversed keeping its magnitude unchanged\nand a proton falls through the same distance [Fig. 1.13(b)]. Compute\nthe time of fall in each case. Contrast the situation with that of ‘free\nfall under gravity’.\n\nFIGURE 1.13\n\nSolution In Fig. 1.13(a) the field is upward, so the negatively charged\nelectron experiences a downward force of magnitude eE where E is\nthe magnitude of the electric field. The acceleration of the electron is\n\na\ne\n  =  eE/m\n\ne\n\nwhere m\ne\n is the mass of the electron.\n\nStarting from rest, the time required by the electron to fall through a\n\ndistance h is given by  \n22\n\ne\n\ne\n\ne\n\nh mh\nt\n\na e E\n= =\n\nFor e = 1.6 × 10–19C, me = 9.11 × 10\n–31 kg,\n\n     E = 2.0 × 104 N C–1, h = 1.5 × 10–2 m,\n\n  te = 2.9 × 10\n–9s\n\nIn Fig. 1.13 (b), the field is downward, and the positively charged\nproton experiences a downward force of magnitude eE . The\nacceleration of the proton is\n\na\np\n  =  eE/m\n\np\n\nwhere m\np\n is the mass of the proton; m\n\np\n = 1.67 × 10–27 kg.

This is in basic contrast to the situation of ‘free\nfall under gravity’ where the time of fall is independent of the mass of\nthe body. Note that in this example we have ignored the acceleration\ndue to gravity in calculating the time of fall. To see if this is justified,\nlet us calculate the acceleration of the proton in the given electric\nfield:\n\np\n\np\n\ne E\na\n\nm\n=\n\n     \n19 4 1\n\n27\n\n(1 6 10 C) (2 0 10 N C )\n1 67 10 kg\n\n. .\n\n.\n\n− −\n\n−\n\n× × ×\n=\n\n×\n\n     12 –21 9 10 m s.= ×\n\nwhich is enormous compared to the value of g (9.8 m s–2), the\nacceleration due to gravity. The acceleration of the electron is even\ngreater. Thus, the effect of acceleration due to gravity can be ignored\nin this example.\n\nExample 1.9 Two point charges q1 and q2, of magnitude +10\n–8 C and\n\n–10–8 C, respectively, are placed 0.1 m apart.

It is a vector quantity\nand can be represented as we represent vectors. Let us try to represent E\ndue to a point charge pictorially. Let the point charge be placed at the\norigin. Draw vectors pointing along the direction of the\nelectric field with their lengths proportional to the strength\nof the field at each point. Since the magnitude of electric\nfield at a point decreases inversely as the square of the\ndistance of that point from the charge, the vector gets\nshorter as one goes away from the origin, always pointing\nradially outward. Figure 1.15 shows such a picture.  In\nthis figure, each arrow indicates the electric field, i.e., the\nforce acting on a unit positive charge, placed at the tail of\nthat arrow.  Connect the arrows pointing in one direction\nand the resulting figure represents a field line. We thus\nget many field lines, all pointing outwards from the point\ncharge. Have we lost the information about the strength\nor magnitude of the field now, because it was contained\nin the length of the arrow? No. Now the magnitude of the\nfield is represented by the density of field lines. E is strong\nnear the charge, so the density of field lines is more near\nthe charge and the lines are closer. Away from the charge,\nthe field gets weaker and the density of field lines is less,\nresulting in well-separated lines.\n\nAnother person may draw more lines. But the number of lines is not\nimportant. In fact, an infinite number of lines can be drawn in any region.\n\nFIGURE 1.15 Field of a point charge.\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n.9\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n24\n\nPhysics\n\nIt is the relative density of lines in different regions which is\nimportant.\n\nWe draw the figure on the plane of paper, i.e., in two-\ndimensions but we live in three-dimensions. So if one wishes\nto estimate the density of field lines, one has to consider the\nnumber of lines per unit cross-sectional area, perpendicular\nto the lines.  Since the electric field decreases as the square of\nthe distance from a point charge and the area enclosing the\ncharge increases as the square of the distance, the number\nof field lines crossing the enclosing area remains constant,\nwhatever may be the distance of the area from the charge.\n\nWe started by saying that the field lines carry information\nabout the direction of electric field at different points in space.\nHaving drawn a certain set of field lines, the relative density\n(i.e., closeness) of the field lines at different points indicates\nthe relative strength of electric field at those points. The field\nlines crowd where the field is strong and are spaced apart\nwhere it is weak. Figure 1.16 shows a set of field lines. We\n\ncan imagine two equal and small elements of area placed at points R and\nS normal to the field lines there. The number of field lines in our picture\ncutting the area elements is proportional to the magnitude of field at\nthese points. The picture shows that the field at R is stronger than at S.\n\nTo understand the dependence of the field lines on the area, or rather\nthe solid angle subtended by an area element, let us try to relate the\narea with the solid angle, a generalisation of angle to three dimensions.\nRecall how a (plane) angle is defined in two-dimensions. Let a small\ntransverse line element ∆l be placed at a distance r from a point O. Then\nthe angle subtended by ∆l  at O can be approximated as ∆θ = ∆l/r.\nLikewise, in three-dimensions the solid angle* subtended by a small\nperpendicular plane area ∆S, at a distance r, can be written as\n∆Ω = ∆S/r2. We know that in a given solid angle the number of radial\nfield lines is the same. In Fig. 1.16, for two points P\n\n1\n and P\n\n2\n at distances\n\nr1 and r2 from the charge, the element of area subtending the solid angle\n∆Ω is 21r ∆Ω at P1 and an element of area \n\n2\n2r ∆Ω at P2, respectively. The\n\nnumber of lines (say n) cutting these area elements are the same. The\nnumber of field lines, cutting unit area element is therefore n/( 21r ∆Ω) at\nP1 and n/(\n\n2\n2r ∆Ω) at P2, respectively. Since n and ∆Ω are common, the\n\nstrength of the field clearly has a 1/r 2 dependence.\nThe picture of field lines was invented by Faraday to develop an\n\nintuitive non-mathematical way of visualising electric fields around\ncharged configurations. Faraday called them lines of force. This term is\nsomewhat misleading, especially in case of magnetic fields. The more\n\nappropriate term is field lines (electric or magnetic) that we have\nadopted in this book.\n\nElectric field lines are thus a way of pictorially mapping the electric\nfield around a configuration of charges. An electric field line is, in general,\n\nFIGURE 1.16  Dependence of\nelectric field strength on the\n\ndistance and its relation to the\nnumber of field lines.\n\n* Solid angle is a measure of a cone. Consider the intersection of the given cone\nwith a sphere of radius R. The solid angle ∆Ω of the cone is defined to be equal\nto ∆S/R\n\n2\n, where ∆S is the area on the sphere cut out by the cone.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectric Charges\n\nand Fields\n\n25\n\na curve drawn in such a way that the tangent to it at each\npoint is in the direction of the net field at that point. An\narrow on the curve is obviously necessary to specify the\ndirection of electric field from the two possible directions\nindicated by a tangent to the curve. A field line is a space\ncurve, i.e., a curve in three dimensions.\n\nFigure 1.17 shows the field lines around some simple\ncharge configurations. As mentioned earlier, the field lines\nare in 3-dimensional space, though the figure shows them\nonly in a plane. The field lines of a single positive charge\nare radially outward while those of a single negative\ncharge are radially inward. The field lines around a system\nof two positive charges (q, q) give a vivid pictorial\ndescription of their mutual repulsion, while those around\nthe configuration of two equal and opposite charges\n(q, –q), a dipole, show clearly the mutual attraction\nbetween the charges. The field lines follow some important\ngeneral properties:\n(i) Field lines start from positive charges and end at\n\nnegative charges. If there is a single charge, they may\nstart or end at infinity.\n\n(ii) In a charge-free region, electric field lines can be taken\nto be continuous curves without any breaks.\n\n(iii) Two field lines can never cross each other. (If they did,\nthe field at the point of intersection will not have a\nunique direction, which is absurd.)\n\n(iv) Electrostatic field lines do not form any closed loops.\nThis follows from the conservative nature of electric\nfield (Chapter 2).\n\n1.10  ELECTRIC FLUX\n\nConsider flow of a liquid with velocity v, through a small\nflat surface dS, in a direction normal to the surface. The\nrate of flow of liquid is given by the volume crossing the\narea per unit time  v dS and represents the flux of liquid\nflowing across the plane. If the normal to the surface is\nnot parallel to the direction of flow of liquid, i.e., to v, but\nmakes an angle θ with it, the projected area in a plane\n\nperpendicular to v is δ dS cos θ. Therefore, the flux going\nout of the surface dS is v. n̂ dS. For the case of  the electric\nfield, we define an analogous quantity and call it electric\nflux. We should, however, note that there is no flow of a\nphysically observable quantity unlike the case of\nliquid flow.\n\nIn the picture of electric field lines described above,\nwe saw that the number of field lines crossing a unit area,\nplaced normal to the field at a point is a measure of the\nstrength of electric field at that point. This means that if\n\nFIGURE 1.17 Field lines due to\nsome simple charge configurations.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n26\n\nPhysics\n\nwe place a small planar element of area ∆S\nnormal to E at a point, the number of field lines\ncrossing it is proportional* to E ∆S. Now\nsuppose we tilt the area element by angle θ.\nClearly, the number of field lines crossing the\narea element will be smaller. The projection of\nthe area element normal to E is ∆S cosθ. Thus,\nthe number of field lines crossing ∆S is\nproportional to E ∆S cosθ. When θ = 90°, field\nlines will be parallel to ∆S and will not cross it\nat all (Fig. 1.18).\n\nThe orientation of area element and not\nmerely its magnitude is important in many\ncontexts. For example, in a stream, the amount\nof water flowing through a ring will naturally\ndepend on how you hold the ring. If you hold\nit normal to the flow, maximum water will flow\nthrough it than if you hold it with some other\norientation. This shows that an area element\nshould be treated as a vector. It has a\n\nmagnitude and also a direction. How to specify the direction of a planar\narea? Clearly, the normal to the plane specifies the orientation of the\nplane. Thus the direction of a planar area vector is along its normal.\n\nHow to associate a vector to the area of a curved surface? We imagine\ndividing the surface into a large number of very small area elements.\nEach small area element may be treated as planar and a vector associated\nwith it, as explained before.\n\nNotice one ambiguity here. The direction of an area element is along\nits normal. But a normal can point in two directions. Which direction do\nwe choose as the direction of the vector associated with the area element?\nThis problem is resolved by some convention appropriate to the given\ncontext. For the case of a closed surface, this convention is very simple.\nThe vector associated with every area element of a closed surface is taken\nto be in the direction of the outward normal. This is the convention used\nin Fig. 1.19. Thus, the area element vector ∆S at a point on a closed\n\nsurface equals ∆S n̂  where ∆S is the magnitude of the area element and\n\nn̂  is a unit vector in the direction of outward normal at that point.\nWe now come to the definition of electric flux. Electric flux ∆φ through\n\nan area element ∆S is defined by\n\n∆φ = E.∆S = E ∆S  cosθ (1.11)\n\nwhich, as seen before, is proportional to the number of field lines cutting\nthe area element. The angle θ here is the angle between E and ∆S. For a\nclosed surface, with the convention stated already, θ is the angle between\nE and the outward normal   to the area element. Notice we could look at\nthe expression E ∆S cosθ  in two ways:  E (∆S cosθ ) i.e., E times the\n\nFIGURE 1.18 Dependence of flux on the\ninclination θ between E and n̂ .\n\nFIGURE 1.19\nConvention for\ndefining normal\n\nn̂  and ∆S. * It will not be proper to say that the number of field lines is equal to E∆S. The\nnumber of field lines is after all, a matter of how many field lines we choose to\ndraw. What is physically significant is the relative number of field lines crossing\na given area at different points.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectric Charges\n\nand Fields\n\n27\n\nprojection of area normal to E,  or E\n⊥\n ∆S, i.e., component of E along the\n\nnormal to the area element times the magnitude of the area element. The\nunit of electric flux is N C–1 m2.\n\nThe basic definition of electric flux given by Eq. (1.11) can be used, in\nprinciple, to calculate the total flux through any given surface. All we\nhave to do is to divide the surface into small area elements, calculate the\nflux at each element and add them up. Thus, the total flux φ through a\nsurface S is\n\nφ ~ Σ E.∆S (1.12)\n\nThe approximation sign is put because the electric field E is taken to\nbe constant over the small area element. This is mathematically exact\nonly when you take the limit ∆S → 0  and the sum in Eq. (1.12) is written\nas an integral.\n\n1.11  ELECTRIC DIPOLE\nAn electric dipole is a pair of equal and opposite point charges q and –q,\nseparated by a distance 2a. The line connecting the two charges defines\na direction in space. By convention, the direction from –q to q is said to\nbe the direction of the dipole. The mid-point of locations of –q and q is\ncalled the centre of the dipole.\n\nThe total charge of the electric dipole is obviously zero. This does not\nmean that the field of the electric dipole is zero. Since the charge q and\n–q are separated by some distance, the electric fields due to them, when\nadded, do not exactly cancel out. However, at distances much larger than\nthe separation of the two charges forming a dipole (r >> 2a), the fields\ndue to q and –q nearly cancel out. The electric field due to a dipole\ntherefore falls off, at large distance, faster than like 1/r 2 (the dependence\non r of the field due to a single charge q). These qualitative ideas are\nborne out by the explicit calculation as follows:\n\n1.11.1  The field of an electric dipole\n\nThe electric field of the pair of charges (–q and q) at any point in space\ncan be found out from Coulomb’s law and the superposition principle.\nThe results are simple for the following two cases: (i) when the point is on\nthe dipole axis, and (ii) when it is in the equatorial plane of the dipole,\ni.e.,  on a plane perpendicular to the dipole axis through its centre.  The\nelectric field at any general point P is obtained by adding the electric\nfields E\n\n–q\n due to the charge –q and E+q due to the charge q, by the\n\nparallelogram law of vectors.\n\n(i) For points on the axis\n\nLet the point P be at distance r from the centre of the dipole on the side of\nthe charge q,  as shown in Fig. 1.20(a).

The dipole moment\nvector p of an electric dipole is defined by\n\np  = q × 2a p̂ (1.19)\nthat is, it is a vector whose magnitude is charge q times the separation\n2a (between the pair of charges q, –q) and the direction is along the line\nfrom –q to q. In terms of p, the electric field of a dipole at large distances\ntakes simple forms:\nAt a point on the dipole axis\n\nE\np\n\n=\n2\n\n4 3πεor\n(r >> a) (1.20)\n\nAt a point on the equatorial plane\n\nE\np\n\n= −\n4 3πεor\n\n(r >> a) (1.21)\n\nFIGURE 1.20 Electric field of a dipole\nat (a) a point on the axis, (b) a point\non the equatorial plane of the dipole.\n\np is the dipole moment vector of\nmagnitude p = q × 2a  and\n\ndirected from –q to q.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectric Charges\n\nand Fields\n\n29\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n.1\n0\n\n Notice the important point that the dipole field at large distances\nfalls off not as 1/r2 but as1/r3. Further,  the magnitude and the direction\nof the dipole field depends not only on the distance r but also on the\nangle between the position vector r and the dipole moment p.\n\nWe can think of the limit when the dipole size 2a approaches zero,\nthe charge q approaches infinity in such a way that the product\np = q × 2a is finite. Such a dipole is referred to as a point dipole. For a\npoint dipole, Eqs. (1.20) and (1.21) are exact, true for any r.\n\n1.11.2  Physical significance of dipoles\n\nIn most molecules, the centres of positive charges and of negative charges*\nlie at the same place. Therefore, their dipole moment is zero. CO\n\n2\n and\n\nCH\n4\n are of this type of molecules. However, they develop a dipole moment\n\nwhen an electric field is applied. But in some molecules, the centres of\nnegative charges and of positive charges do not coincide. Therefore they\nhave a permanent electric dipole moment, even in the absence of an electric\nfield. Such molecules are called polar molecules. Water molecules, H2O,\nis an example of this type. Various materials give rise to interesting\nproperties and important applications in the presence or  absence of\nelectric field.\n\nExample 1.10 Two charges ±10 µC are placed 5.0 mm apart.\nDetermine the electric field at (a) a point P on the axis of the dipole\n15 cm away from its centre O on the side of the positive charge, as\nshown in Fig. 1.21(a), and (b) a point Q, 15 cm away from O on a line\npassing through O and normal to the axis of the dipole, as shown in\nFig. 1.21(b).\n\nFIGURE 1.21\n\n* Centre of a collection of positive point charges is defined much the same way\n\nas the centre of mass: r\nr\n\ncm =\n∑\n\n∑\n\nq\n\nq\n\ni i\ni\n\ni\ni\n\n.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n30\n\nPhysics\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n.1\n0\n\nSolution  (a) Field at P due to charge +10 µC\n\n= \n\n5\n\n12 2 1 2\n\n10 C\n\n4 (8.854 10 C N m )\n\n−\n\n− − −\nπ ×\n\n2 4 2\n\n1\n\n(15 0.25) 10 m−\n×\n\n− ×\n\n=  4.13 × 106  N C–1  along BP\nField at P due to charge –10 µC\n\n–5\n\n12 2 1 2\n\n10 C\n4 (8.854 10 C N m )− − −\n\n=\nπ ×\n\n 2 4 2\n1\n\n(15 0.25) 10 m−\n×\n\n+ ×\n\n=  3.86 × 106  N C–1 along PA\nThe resultant electric field at P due to the two charges at A and B is\n=  2.7 × 105  N C–1  along BP.\nIn this example, the ratio OP/OB is quite large (= 60). Thus, we can\nexpect to get approximately the same result as above by directly using\nthe formula for electric field at a far-away point on the axis of a dipole.\nFor a dipole consisting of charges ± q, 2a distance apart, the electric\nfield at a distance r from the centre on the axis of the dipole has a\nmagnitude\n\nE\np\n\nr\n=\n\n2\n\n4 0\n3\n\nπε\n(r/a >> 1)\n\nwhere p = 2a q is the magnitude of the dipole moment.\nThe direction of electric field on the dipole axis is always along the\ndirection of the dipole moment vector (i.e., from –q to q).

Again, the result agrees with that obtained\nbefore.\n\n1.12  DIPOLE IN A UNIFORM EXTERNAL FIELD\nConsider a permanent dipole of dipole moment p in a uniform\nexternal field E, as shown in Fig. 1.22. (By permanent dipole, we\nmean that p exists  irrespective of E; it has not been induced by E.)\n\nThere is a force qE on q and a force –qE on –q. The net force on\nthe dipole is zero, since E is uniform. However, the charges are\nseparated, so the forces act at different points, resulting in a torque\non the dipole. When the net force is zero, the torque (couple) is\nindependent of the origin. Its magnitude equals the magnitude of\neach force multiplied by the arm of the couple (perpendicular\ndistance between the two antiparallel forces).\n\nMagnitude of torque = q E × 2 a sinθ\n       = 2 q a E sinθ\n\nIts direction is normal to the plane of the paper, coming out of it.\nThe magnitude of p × E is also p E sinθ and its direction\n\nis normal to the paper, coming out of it. Thus,\n\nτττττ  = p × E (1.22)\n\nThis torque will tend to align the dipole with the field\nE. When p is aligned with E, the torque is zero.\n\nWhat happens if the field is not uniform? In that case,\nthe net force will evidently be non-zero. In addition there\nwill, in general, be a torque on the system as before. The\ngeneral case is involved, so let us consider the simpler\nsituations when p is parallel to E or antiparallel to E. In\neither case, the net torque is zero, but there is a net force\non the dipole if E is not uniform.\n\nFigure 1.23 is self-explanatory. It is easily seen that\nwhen p is parallel to E, the dipole has a net force in the\ndirection of increasing field. When p is antiparallel to E,\nthe net force on the dipole is in the direction of decreasing\nfield. In general, the force depends on the orientation of p\nwith respect to E.\n\nThis brings us to a common observation in frictional\nelectricity. A comb run through dry hair attracts pieces of\npaper. The comb, as we know, acquires charge through\nfriction. But the paper is not charged. What then explains\nthe attractive force? Taking the clue from the preceding\n\nFIGURE 1.22 Dipole in a\nuniform electric field.\n\nFIGURE 1.23 Electric force on a\ndipole: (a) E parallel to p, (b)  E\n\nantiparallel to p.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n32\n\nPhysics\n\ndiscussion, the charged comb ‘polarises’ the piece of paper, i.e., induces\na net dipole moment in the direction of field. Further, the electric field\ndue to the comb is not uniform. This non-uniformity of the field makes a\ndipole to experience a net force on it. In this situation, it is easily seen\nthat the paper should move in the direction of the comb!\n\n1.13  CONTINUOUS CHARGE DISTRIBUTION\nWe have so far dealt with charge configurations involving discrete charges\nq\n\n1\n, q\n\n2\n, ..., q\n\nn\n. One reason why we restricted to discrete charges is that the\n\nmathematical treatment is simpler and does not involve calculus. For\nmany purposes, however, it is impractical to work in terms of discrete\ncharges and we need to work with continuous charge distributions. For\nexample, on the surface of a charged conductor, it is impractical to specify\nthe charge distribution in terms of the locations of the microscopic charged\nconstituents. It is more feasible to consider an area element ∆S (Fig. 1.24)\non the surface of the conductor (which is very small on the macroscopic\nscale but big enough to include a very large number of electrons) and\nspecify the charge ∆Q on that element. We then define a surface charge\ndensity σ at the area element by\n\nQ\n\nS\nσ\n\n∆\n=\n\n∆\n(1.23)\n\nWe can do this at different points on the conductor and thus arrive at\na continuous function σ, called the surface charge density. The surface\ncharge density σ  so defined ignores the quantisation of charge and the\ndiscontinuity in charge distribution at the microscopic level*. σ  represents\nmacroscopic surface charge density, which in a sense, is a smoothed out\naverage of the microscopic charge density over an area element ∆S which,\nas said before, is large microscopically but small macroscopically. The\nunits for σ are C/m2.\n\nSimilar considerations apply for a line charge distribution and a volume\ncharge distribution. The linear charge density λ of a wire is defined by\n\nQ\n\nl\nλ\n\n∆\n=\n\n∆\n(1.24)\n\nwhere ∆l is a small line element of wire on the macroscopic scale that,\nhowever, includes a large number of microscopic charged constituents,\nand ∆Q is the charge contained in that line element. The units for λ are\nC/m. The volume charge density (sometimes simply called charge density)\nis defined in a similar manner:\n\nQ\n\nV\nρ\n\n∆\n=\n\n∆\n(1.25)\n\nwhere ∆Q is the charge included in the macroscopically small volume\nelement ∆V that includes a large number of microscopic charged\nconstituents. The units for ρ are C/m3.\n\nThe notion of continuous charge distribution is similar to that we\nadopt for continuous mass distribution in mechanics. When we refer to\n\nFIGURE 1.24\n\nDefinition of linear,\nsurface and volume\n\ncharge densities.\nIn each case, the\n\nelement (∆l, ∆S, ∆V )\nchosen is small on\nthe macroscopic\n\nscale but contains\na very large number\n\nof microscopic\nconstituents.\n\n* At the microscopic level, charge distribution is discontinuous, because they are\ndiscrete charges separated by intervening space where there is no charge.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectric Charges\n\nand Fields\n\n33\n\nthe density of a liquid, we are referring to its macroscopic density. We\nregard it as a continuous fluid and ignore its discrete molecular\nconstitution.\n\nThe field due to a continuous charge distribution can be obtained in\nmuch the same way as for a system of discrete charges, Eq. (1.10). Suppose\na continuous charge distribution in space has a charge density ρ. Choose\nany convenient origin O and let the position vector of any point in the\ncharge distribution be r. The charge density ρ may vary from point to\npoint, i.e., it is a function of r. Divide the charge distribution into small\nvolume elements of size ∆V. The charge in a volume element ∆V is ρ∆V.\n\nNow, consider any general point P (inside or outside the distribution)\nwith position vector R (Fig. 1.24). Electric field due to the charge ρ∆V is\ngiven by Coulomb’s law:\n\n2\n0\n\n1\nˆ\n\n4\nV\n\n'\nr'\n\nρ\n\nε\n\n∆\n∆ =\n\nπ\nE r (1.26)\n\nwhere r′ is the distance between the charge element and P, and  r̂ ′ is a\nunit vector in the direction from the charge element to P. By the\nsuperposition principle, the total electric field due to the charge\ndistribution is obtained by summing over electric fields due to different\nvolume elements:\n\n2\n0\n\n1\nˆ\n\n4 all V\nV\n\n'\nr'\n\nρ\n\nε ∆\n∆\n\n≅ Σ\nπ\n\nE r (1.27)\n\nNote that ρ, r′,  ˆ ′r  all can vary from point to point. In a strict\nmathematical method, we should let ∆V→0 and the sum then becomes\nan integral; but we omit that discussion here, for simplicity. In short,\nusing Coulomb’s law and the superposition principle, electric field can\nbe determined for any charge distribution, discrete or continuous or part\ndiscrete and part continuous.\n\n1.14  GAUSS’S LAW\nAs a simple application of the notion of electric flux, let us consider the\ntotal flux through a sphere of radius r, which encloses a point charge q\nat its centre. Divide the sphere into small area elements, as shown in\nFig. 1.25.\n\nThe flux through an area element ∆S is\n\n2\n0\n\nˆ\n4\n\nq\n\nr\nφ\n\nε\n∆ = ∆ = ∆\n\nπ\nE S r Si i (1.28)\n\nwhere we have used Coulomb’s law for the electric field due to a single\ncharge q. The unit vector r̂  is along the radius vector from the centre to\nthe area element. Now, since the normal to a sphere at every point is\nalong the radius vector at that point, the area element ∆S and r̂   have\nthe same direction. Therefore,\n\n2\n04\nq\n\nS\nr\n\nφ\nε\n\n∆ = ∆\nπ\n\n(1.29)\n\nsince the magnitude of a unit vector is 1.\nThe total flux through the sphere is obtained by adding up flux\n\nthrough all the different area elements:\n\nFIGURE 1.25 Flux\nthrough a sphere\nenclosing a point\n\ncharge q at its centre.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n34\n\nPhysics\n\n2\n04all S\n\nq\nS\n\nr\nφ\n\nε∆\n= Σ ∆\n\nπ\n\nSince each area element of the sphere is at the same\ndistance r from the charge,\n\n2 2\n04 4all So\n\nq q\nS S\n\nr r\nφ\n\nε ε∆\n= Σ ∆ =\n\nπ π\n\nNow S, the total area of the sphere, equals 4πr2. Thus,\n\n2\n2\n\n00\n\n4\n4\n\nq q\nr\n\nr\nφ\n\nεε\n= × π =\n\nπ\n(1.30)\n\nEquation (1.30) is a simple illustration of a general result of\nelectrostatics called Gauss’s law.\n\nWe state Gauss’s law without proof:\nElectric flux through a closed surface S\n\n= q/ε\n0\n\n(1.31)\n\nq = total charge enclosed by S.\n\nThe law implies that the total electric flux through a closed surface is\nzero if no charge is enclosed by the surface. We can see that explicitly in\nthe simple situation of Fig. 1.26.\n\nHere the electric field is uniform and we are considering a closed\ncylindrical surface, with its axis parallel to the uniform field E. The total\nflux φ  through the surface is  φ = φ\n\n1\n + φ\n\n2\n + φ\n\n3\n, where φ\n\n1\n and φ\n\n2\n represent\n\nthe flux through the surfaces 1 and 2 (of circular cross-section) of the\ncylinder and φ\n\n3\n is the flux through the curved cylindrical part of the\n\nclosed surface. Now the normal to the surface 3 at every point is\nperpendicular to E, so by definition of flux, φ3 = 0. Further, the outward\nnormal to 2 is along E while the outward normal to 1 is opposite to E.\nTherefore,\n\nφ\n1\n = –E S\n\n1\n,     φ\n\n2\n = +E S\n\n2\n\nS\n1\n = S\n\n2\n = S\n\nwhere S is the area of circular cross-section. Thus, the total flux is zero,\nas expected by Gauss’s law. Thus, whenever you find that the net electric\nflux through a closed surface is zero, we conclude that the total charge\ncontained in the closed surface is zero.\n\nThe great significance of Gauss’s law Eq. (1.31), is that it is true in\ngeneral, and not only for the simple cases we have considered above. Let\nus note some important points regarding this law:\n(i) Gauss’s law is true for any closed surface, no matter what its shape\n\nor size.\n(ii) The term q on the right side of Gauss’s law, Eq. (1.31), includes the\n\nsum of all charges enclosed by the surface. The charges may be located\nanywhere inside the surface.\n\n(iii) In the situation when the surface is so chosen that there are some\ncharges inside and some outside, the electric field [whose flux appears\non the left side of Eq. (1.31)] is due to all the charges, both inside and\noutside S. The term q on the right side of Gauss’s law, however,\nrepresents only the total charge inside S.\n\nFIGURE 1.26 Calculation of the\nflux of uniform electric field\n\nthrough the surface of a cylinder.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectric Charges\n\nand Fields\n\n35\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n.1\n1\n\n(iv) The surface that we choose for the application of Gauss’s law is called\nthe Gaussian surface. You may choose any Gaussian surface and\napply Gauss’s law. However, take care not to let the Gaussian surface\npass through any discrete charge. This is because electric field due\nto a system of discrete charges is not well defined at the location of\nany charge. (As you go close to the charge, the field grows without\nany bound.) However, the Gaussian surface can pass through a\ncontinuous charge distribution.\n\n(v) Gauss’s law is often useful towards a much easier calculation of the\nelectrostatic field when the system has some symmetry. This is\nfacilitated by the choice of a suitable Gaussian surface.\n\n(vi) Finally, Gauss’s law is based on the inverse square dependence on\ndistance contained in the Coulomb’s law. Any violation of Gauss’s\nlaw will indicate departure from the inverse square law.\n\nExample 1.11 The electric field components in Fig. 1.27 are\nE\n\nx\n = αx1/2, E\n\ny\n = E\n\nz\n = 0, in which α = 800 N/C m1/2. Calculate (a) the\n\nflux through the cube, and (b) the charge within the cube.

Therefore, the flux  φ = E.∆S is separately zero for each face\nof the cube except the two shaded ones. Now the magnitude of\nthe electric field at the left face is\nE\n\nL\n = αx1/2 = αa1/2\n\n(x = a at the left face).\nThe magnitude of electric field at the right face is\nE\n\nR\n = α x1/2 = α (2a)1/2\n\n(x = 2a at the right face).\nThe corresponding fluxes are\n\nφ\nL\n= E\n\nL\n.∆S = ˆ\n\nL LS∆ E n⋅⋅⋅⋅ =EL ∆S cosθ = –EL ∆S, since θ = 180°\n\n   = –E\nL\na\n\n2\n\nφ\nR\n= E\n\nR\n.∆S = E\n\nR\n ∆S cosθ  = E\n\nR\n ∆S,   since θ = 0°\n\n   = E\nR\na\n\n2\n\nNet flux through the cube\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n36\n\nPhysics\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n.1\n2\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n.1\n1\n\n= φ\nR \n\n+ φ\nL\n = E\n\nR\na\n\n2 – E\nL\na\n\n2 = a2 (E\nR\n – E\n\nL\n) = αa2 [(2a)1/2 – a1/2]\n\n=  αa5/2 ( )2 –1\n\n=  800 (0.1)5/2 ( )2 –1\n= 1.05 N m2 C–1\n\n(b) We can use Gauss’s law to find the total charge q inside the cube.\nWe have φ = q/ε\n\n0\n or q = φε\n\n0\n. Therefore,\n\n  q = 1.05 × 8.854 × 10–12 C = 9.27 × 10–12 C.\n\nExample 1.12 An electric field is uniform, and in the positive x\ndirection for positive x, and uniform with the same magnitude but in\nthe negative x direction for negative x. It is given that E = 200 î   N/C\nfor x > 0 and E = –200 î  N/C for x < 0. A right circular cylinder of\nlength 20 cm and radius 5 cm has its centre at the origin and its axis\nalong the x-axis so that one face is at x = +10 cm and the other is at\nx = –10 cm (Fig. 1.28).

(1.27). In practice, except for some special cases, the\nsummation (or integration) involved in this equation cannot be carried\nout to give electric field at every point in\nspace. For some symmetric charge\nconfigurations, however, it is possible to\nobtain the electric field in a simple way using\nthe Gauss’s law. This is best understood by\nsome examples.\n\n1.15.1 Field due to an infinitely\nlong straight uniformly\ncharged wire\n\nConsider an infinitely long thin straight wire\nwith uniform linear charge density λ. The wire\nis obviously an axis of symmetry. Suppose we\ntake the radial vector from O to P and rotate it\naround the wire. The points P, P′, P′′ so\nobtained are completely equivalent with\nrespect to the charged wire. This implies that\nthe electric field must have the same magnitude\nat these points. The direction of electric field at\nevery point must be radial (outward if λ > 0,\ninward if λ < 0). This is clear from Fig. 1.29.\n\nConsider a pair of line elements P\n1\n and P\n\n2\nof the wire, as shown. The electric fields\nproduced by the two elements of the pair when\nsummed give a resultant electric field which\nis radial (the components normal to the radial\nvector cancel). This is true for any such pair\nand hence the total field at any point P is\nradial. Finally, since the wire is infinite,\nelectric field does not depend on the position\nof P along the length of the wire. In short, the\nelectric field is everywhere radial in the plane\ncutting the wire normally, and its magnitude\ndepends only on the radial distance r.\n\nTo calculate the field, imagine a cylindrical\nGaussian surface, as shown in the Fig. 1.29(b).\nSince the field is everywhere radial, flux\nthrough the two ends of the cylindrical\nGaussian surface is zero. At the cylindrical\npart of the surface, E is normal to the surface\nat every point, and its magnitude is constant,\nsince it depends only on r. The surface area\nof the curved part is  2πrl, where l is the length\nof the cylinder.\n\nFIGURE 1.29 (a) Electric field due to an\ninfinitely long thin straight wire is radial,\n(b) The Gaussian surface for a long thin\nwire of uniform linear charge density.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n38\n\nPhysics\n\nFlux through the Gaussian surface\n\n= flux through the curved cylindrical part of the surface\n\n= E × 2πrl\n\nThe surface includes charge equal to λ l. Gauss’s law then gives\nE × 2πrl = λl/ε\n\n0\n\ni.e., E  = \n02 r\n\nλ\n\nεπ\n\nVectorially, E at any point is given by\n\n0\n\nˆ\n2 r\n\nλ\n\nε\n=\n\nπ\nE n (1.32)\n\nwhere n̂  is the radial unit vector in the plane normal to the wire passing\nthrough the point. E is directed outward if λ is positive and inward if λ is\nnegative.\n\nNote that when we write a vector A as a scalar multiplied by a unit\nvector, i.e., as A = A â , the scalar A is  an algebraic number. It can be\nnegative or positive. The direction of A will be the same as that of the unit\nvector â if A > 0 and opposite to â  if A < 0. When we want to restrict to\nnon-negative values, we use the symbol A and call it the modulus of A .\nThus, 0≥A .\n\nAlso note that though only  the charge enclosed by the surface (λl )\nwas included above, the electric field E is due to the charge on the entire\nwire. Further, the assumption that the wire is infinitely long is crucial.\nWithout this assumption, we cannot take E to be normal to the curved\npart of the cylindrical Gaussian surface. However, Eq. (1.32) is\napproximately true for electric field around the central portions of a long\nwire, where the end effects may be ignored.\n\n1.15.2  Field due to a uniformly charged infinite plane sheet\n\nLet σ be the uniform surface charge density of an infinite plane sheet\n(Fig. 1.30). We take the x-axis normal to the given plane. By symmetry,\nthe electric field will not depend on y and z coordinates and its direction\n\nat every point must be parallel to the x-direction.\nWe can take the Gaussian surface to be a\n\nrectangular parallelepiped of cross-sectional area\nA, as shown. (A cylindrical surface will also do.) As\nseen from the figure, only the two faces 1 and 2 will\ncontribute to the flux; electric field lines are parallel\nto the other faces and they, therefore, do not\ncontribute to the total flux.\n\nThe unit vector normal to surface 1 is in –x\ndirection while  the unit  vector normal to surface 2\nis in the +x direction. Therefore, flux  E.∆S through\nboth the surfaces are equal and add up. Therefore\nthe net flux through the Gaussian surface is 2 EA.\nThe charge enclosed by the closed surface is σA.\nTherefore by Gauss’s law,\n\nFIGURE 1.30 Gaussian surface for a\nuniformly charged infinite plane sheet.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectric Charges\n\nand Fields\n\n39\n\n2 EA = σA/ε\n0\n\nor,  E = σ/2ε\n0\n\nVectorically,\n\n0\n\nˆ\n2\nσ\n\nε\n=E n (1.33)\n\nwhere n̂  is a unit vector normal to the plane and going away from it.\nE is directed away from the plate if σ  is positive and toward the plate\n\nif σ is negative. Note that the above application of the Gauss’ law has\nbrought out an additional fact: E is independent of x also.\n\nFor a finite large planar sheet, Eq. (1.33) is approximately true in the\nmiddle regions of the planar sheet, away from the ends.\n\n1.15.3  Field due to a uniformly charged thin spherical shell\n\nLet σ be the uniform surface charge density of a thin spherical shell of\nradius R (Fig. 1.31). The situation has obvious spherical symmetry. The\nfield at any point P, outside or inside, can depend only on r (the radial\ndistance from the centre of the shell to the point) and must be radial (i.e.,\nalong the radius vector).\n\n(i) Field outside the shell: Consider a point P outside the\nshell with radius vector r. To calculate E at P, we take the\nGaussian surface to be a sphere of radius r and with centre\nO, passing through P. All points on this sphere are equivalent\nrelative to the given charged configuration. (That is what we\nmean by spherical symmetry.) The electric field at each point\nof the Gaussian surface, therefore, has the same magnitude\nE and is along the radius vector at each point. Thus, E and\n∆S at every point are parallel and the flux through each\nelement is E ∆S. Summing over all ∆S, the flux through the\nGaussian surface is E × 4 π r 2. The charge enclosed is\nσ × 4 π R 2. By Gauss’s law\n\nE × 4 π r 2 = \n2\n\n0\n\n4 R\nσ\n\nε\nπ\n\nOr,  \n2\n\n2 2\n0 04\nR q\n\nE\nr r\n\nσ\n\nε ε\n= =\n\nπ\n\nwhere q  =  4 π R2 σ is the total charge on the spherical shell.\nVectorially,\n\n2\n0\n\nˆ\n4\n\nq\n\nrε\n=\n\nπ\nE r (1.34)\n\nThe electric field is directed outward if q > 0 and inward if\nq < 0. This, however, is exactly the field produced by a charge\nq placed at the centre O. Thus for points outside the shell, the field due\nto a uniformly charged shell is as if  the entire charge of the shell is\nconcentrated at its centre.\n\n(ii) Field inside the shell: In Fig. 1.31(b), the point P is inside the\nshell. The Gaussian surface is again a sphere through P centred at O.\n\nFIGURE 1.31 Gaussian\nsurfaces for a point with\n\n(a) r > R, (b) r < R.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n40\n\nPhysics\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n.1\n3\n\nThe flux through the Gaussian surface, calculated as before, is\nE × 4 π r2. However, in this case, the Gaussian surface encloses no\ncharge. Gauss’s law then gives\nE × 4 π r2 =  0\ni.e., E = 0          (r < R ) (1.35)\n\nthat is, the field due to a uniformly charged thin shell is zero at all points\ninside the shell*. This important result is a direct consequence of Gauss’s\nlaw which follows from Coulomb’s law. The experimental verification of\nthis result confirms the 1/r2 dependence in Coulomb’s law.\n\nExample 1.13 An early model for an atom considered it to have a\npositively charged point nucleus of charge Ze, surrounded by a\nuniform density of negative charge up to a radius R. The atom as a\nwhole is neutral. For this model, what is the electric field at a distance\nr from the nucleus?\n\nFIGURE 1.32\n\nSolution  The charge distribution for this model of the atom is as\nshown in Fig. 1.32. The total negative charge in the uniform spherical\ncharge distribution of radius R must be –Z e, since the atom (nucleus\nof charge Z e + negative charge) is neutral. This immediately gives us\nthe negative charge density ρ, since we must have\n\n34\n0–\n\n3\n\nR\nZeρ\n\nπ\n=\n\nor 3\n3\n\n4\nZe\n\nR\nρ = −\n\nπ\n\nTo find the electric field E(r) at a point P which is a distance r away\nfrom the nucleus, we use Gauss’s law. Because of the spherical\nsymmetry of the charge distribution, the magnitude of the electric\nfield E(r) depends only on the radial distance, no matter what the\ndirection of r. Its direction is along (or opposite to) the radius vector r\nfrom the origin to the point P. The obvious Gaussian surface is a\nspherical surface centred at the nucleus. We consider two situations,\nnamely, r < R and r > R.\n(i) r < R : The electric flux φ enclosed by the spherical surface is\n\n    φ  =  E (r ) × 4 π r 2\n\nwhere E (r )  is the magnitude of the electric field at r. This is because\n\n* Compare this with a uniform mass shell discussed in Section 8.5 of Class XI\nTextbook of Physics.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectric Charges\n\nand Fields\n\n41\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n.1\n3\n\nthe field at any point on the spherical Gaussian surface has the\nsame direction as the normal to the surface there,  and has the same\nmagnitude at all points on the surface.\nThe charge q enclosed by the Gaussian surface is the positive nuclear\ncharge and the negative charge within the sphere of radius r,\n\ni.e., \n34\n\n3\n\nr\nq Z e ρ\n\nπ\n= +\n\nSubstituting for the charge density ρ  obtained earlier, we have\n3\n\n3\n\nr\nq Z e Z e\n\nR\n= −\n\nGauss’s law then gives,\n\n2 3\n0\n\n1\n( ) ;\n\n4\nZ e r\n\nE r r R\nr Rε\n\n  \n= − <    π\n\nThe electric field is directed radially outward.\n(ii) r > R:  In this case, the total charge enclosed by the Gaussian\nspherical surface is zero since the atom is neutral. Thus, from Gauss’s\nlaw,\nE (r ) × 4 π  r 2 = 0  or  E (r ) = 0;    r > R\nAt r = R, both cases give the same result: E = 0.\n\nON SYMMETRY OPERATIONS\n\nIn Physics, we often encounter systems with various symmetries. Consideration of these\nsymmetries helps one arrive at results much faster than otherwise by a straightforward\ncalculation. Consider, for example an infinite uniform sheet of charge (surface charge\ndensity σ) along the y-z plane. This system is unchanged if (a) translated parallel to the\ny-z plane in any direction, (b) rotated about the x-axis through any angle. As the system\nis unchanged under such symmetry operation, so must its properties be. In particular,\nin this example, the electric field E must be unchanged.\n\nTranslation symmetry along the y-axis shows that the electric field must be the same\nat a point (0, y\n\n1\n, 0) as at (0, y\n\n2\n, 0). Similarly translational symmetry along the z-axis\n\nshows that the electric field at two point (0, 0, z\n1\n) and (0, 0, z\n\n2\n) must be the same. By\n\nusing rotation symmetry around the x-axis, we can conclude that E must be\nperpendicular to the y-z plane, that is, it must be parallel to the x-direction.\n\nTry to think of a symmetry now which will tell you that the magnitude of the electric\nfield is a constant, independent of the x-coordinate. It thus turns out that the magnitude\nof the electric field due to a uniformly charged infinite conducting sheet is the same at all\npoints in space. The direction, however, is opposite of each other on either side of\nthe sheet.\n\nCompare this with the effort needed to arrive at this result by a direct calculation\nusing Coulomb’s law.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n42\n\nPhysics\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. Electric and magnetic forces determine the properties of atoms,\nmolecules and bulk matter.\n\n2. From simple experiments on frictional electricity, one can infer that\nthere are two types of charges in nature; and that like charges repel\nand unlike charges attract. By convention, the charge on a glass rod\nrubbed with silk is positive; that on a plastic rod rubbed with fur is\nthen negative.\n\n3. Conductors allow movement of electric charge through them, insulators\ndo not. In metals, the mobile charges are electrons; in electrolytes\nboth positive and negative ions are mobile.\n\n4. Electric charge has three basic properties: quantisation, additivity\nand conservation.\n\nQuantisation of electric charge means that total charge (q) of a body\nis always an integral multiple of a basic quantum of charge (e) i.e.,\nq = n e, where n = 0, ±1, ±2, ±3, .... Proton and electron have charges\n+e, –e, respectively. For macroscopic charges for which n is a very large\nnumber, quantisation of charge can be ignored.\n\nAdditivity of electric charges means that the total charge of a system\nis the algebraic sum (i.e., the sum taking into account proper signs)\nof all individual charges in the system.\n\nConservation of electric charges means that the total charge of an\nisolated system remains unchanged with time. This means that when\nbodies are charged through friction, there is a transfer of electric charge\nfrom one body to another, but no creation or destruction of charge.\n\n5. Coulomb’s Law: The mutual electrostatic force between two point\ncharges q1 and q2 is proportional to the product q1q2 and inversely\nproportional to the square of the distance r\n\n21\n separating them.\n\nMathematically,\n\nF\n21\n\n = force on q\n2\n due to  1 21 212\n\n21\n\nˆ\nk (q q )\n\nq\nr\n\n= r\n\nwhere 21r̂  is a unit vector in the direction from q1 to q2 and k =  \n0\n\n1\n4 επ\n\nis the constant of proportionality.\n\nIn SI units, the unit of charge is coulomb. The experimental value of\nthe constant ε\n\n0\n is\n\nε0 = 8.854 × 10\n–12 C2 N–1 m–2\n\nThe approximate value of k is\n\nk = 9 × 109 N m2 C–2\n\n6. The ratio of electric force and gravitational force between a proton\nand an electron is\n\n2\n392 4 10\n\ne p\n\nk e\n.\n\nG m m\n≅ ×\n\n7. Superposition Principle: The principle is based on the property that the\nforces with which two charges attract or repel each other are not\naffected by the presence of a third (or more) additional charge(s). For\nan assembly of charges q1, q2, q3, ..., the force on any charge, say q1, is\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectric Charges\n\nand Fields\n\n43\n\nthe vector sum of the force on  q\n1\n due to q\n\n2\n, the force on q\n\n1\n due to q\n\n3\n,\n\nand so on. For each pair, the force is given by the Coulomb’s law for\ntwo charges stated earlier.\n\n8. The electric field E at a point due to a charge configuration is the\nforce on a small positive test charge q placed at the point divided by\nthe magnitude of the charge. Electric field due to a point charge q has\na magnitude |q|/4πε\n\n0\nr2; it is radially outwards from q, if q is positive,\n\nand radially inwards if q is negative. Like Coulomb force, electric field\nalso satisfies superposition principle.\n\n9. An electric field line is a curve drawn in such a way that the tangent\nat each point on the curve gives the direction of electric field at that\npoint. The relative closeness of field lines indicates the relative strength\nof electric field at different points; they crowd near each other in regions\nof strong electric field and are far apart where the electric field is\nweak. In regions of constant electric field, the field lines are uniformly\nspaced parallel straight lines.\n\n10. Some of the important properties of field lines are: (i) Field lines are\ncontinuous curves without any breaks. (ii) Two field lines cannot cross\neach other. (iii) Electrostatic field lines start at positive charges and\nend at negative charges —they cannot form closed loops.\n\n11. An electric dipole is a pair of equal and opposite charges q and –q\nseparated by some distance 2a. Its dipole moment vector p has\nmagnitude 2qa and is in the direction of the dipole axis from –q to q.\n\n12.

In a uniform electric field E, a dipole experiences a torque ττττ  given by\n\nττττ  = p × E\n\nbut experiences no net force.\n\n14. The flux ∆φ of electric field E through a small area element ∆S is\ngiven by\n\n ∆φ  = E.∆S\n\nThe vector area element ∆S is\n\n∆S = ∆S n̂\n\nwhere ∆S is the magnitude of the area element and n̂  is normal to the\narea element, which can be considered planar for sufficiently small ∆S.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n44\n\nPhysics\n\nFor an area element of a closed surface, n̂  is taken to be the direction\nof outward normal, by convention.\n\n15. Gauss’s law: The flux of electric field through any closed surface S is\n1/ε\n\n0 \ntimes the total charge enclosed by S.

You might wonder why the protons, all carrying positive charges, are\ncompactly residing inside the nucleus. Why do they not fly away? You\nwill learn that there is a third kind of a fundamental force, called the\nstrong force which holds them together. The range of distance where\nthis force is effective is, however, very small ~10-14 m. This is precisely\nthe size of the nucleus. Also the electrons are not allowed to sit on\ntop of the protons, i.e. inside the nucleus, due to the laws of quantum\nmechanics. This gives the atoms their structure as they exist in nature.\n\n2. Coulomb force and gravitational force follow the same inverse-square\nlaw. But gravitational force has only one sign (always attractive), while\nCoulomb force can be of both signs (attractive and repulsive), allowing\npossibility of cancellation of electric forces. This is how gravity, despite\nbeing a much weaker force, can be a dominating and more pervasive\nforce in nature.\n\n3. The constant of proportionality k in Coulomb’s law is a matter of\nchoice if the unit of charge is to be defined using Coulomb’s law. In SI\nunits, however, what is defined is the unit of current (A) via its magnetic\neffect (Ampere’s law) and the unit of charge (coulomb) is simply defined\nby (1C = 1 A s). In this case, the value of k is no longer arbitrary; it is\napproximately 9 × 109 N m2 C–2.\n\n4. The rather large value of k, i.e., the large size of the unit of charge\n(1C) from the point of view of electric effects arises because (as\nmentioned in point 3 already) the unit of charge is defined in terms of\nmagnetic forces (forces on  current–carrying wires) which are generally\nmuch weaker than the electric forces. Thus while 1 ampere is a unit\nof reasonable size for magnetic effects, 1 C = 1 A s, is too big a unit for\nelectric effects.\n\n5. The additive property of charge is not an ‘obvious’ property. It is related\nto the fact that electric charge has no direction associated with it;\ncharge is a scalar.\n\n6. Charge is not only a scalar (or invariant) under rotation; it is also\ninvariant for frames of reference in relative motion. This is not always\ntrue for every scalar. For example, kinetic energy is a scalar under\nrotation, but is not invariant for frames of reference in relative\nmotion.\n\n7. Conservation of total charge of an isolated system is a property\nindependent of the scalar nature of charge noted in point 6.\nConservation refers to invariance in time in a given frame of reference.\nA quantity may be scalar but not conserved (like kinetic energy in an\ninelastic collision). On the other hand, one can have conserved vector\nquantity (e.g., angular momentum of an isolated system).\n\n8. Quantisation of electric charge is a basic (unexplained) law of nature;\ninterestingly, there is no analogous law on quantisation of mass.\n\n9. Superposition principle should not be regarded as ‘obvious’, or equated\nwith the law of addition of vectors. It says two things: force on one\ncharge due to another charge is unaffected by the presence of other\ncharges, and there are no additional three-body, four-body, etc., forces\nwhich arise only when there are more than two charges.\n\n10. The electric field due to a discrete charge configuration is not defined\nat the locations of the discrete charges. For continuous volume charge\ndistribution, it is defined at any point in the distribution. For a surface\ncharge distribution, electric field is discontinuous across the surface.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n46\n\nPhysics\n\n11. The electric field due to a charge configuration with total charge zero\nis not zero; but for distances large compared to the size of\nthe configuration, its field falls off faster than 1/r 2, typical of field\ndue to a single charge. An electric dipole is the simplest example of\nthis fact.\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1.1 What is the force between  two small charged spheres having\ncharges of 2 × 10–7C and 3 × 10–7C placed 30 cm apart in air?\n\n1.2 The electrostatic force on a small sphere of charge 0.4 µC due to\nanother small sphere of charge –0.8 µC in air is 0.2 N.

When an external force does work in taking a body from a\npoint to another against a force like spring force or gravitational force,\nthat work gets stored as potential energy of the body. When the external\nforce is removed, the body moves, gaining kinetic energy and losing\nan equal amount of potential energy. The sum of kinetic and\npotential energies is thus conserved. Forces of this kind are called\nconservative forces. Spring force and gravitational force are examples of\nconservative forces.\n\nCoulomb force between two (stationary) charges is also a conservative\nforce. This is not surprising, since both have inverse-square dependence\non distance and differ mainly in the proportionality constants – the\nmasses in the gravitational law are replaced by charges in Coulomb’s\nlaw. Thus, like the potential energy of a mass in a gravitational\nfield, we can define electrostatic potential energy of a charge in an\nelectrostatic field.\n\nConsider an electrostatic field E due to some charge configuration.\nFirst, for simplicity, consider the field E due to a charge Q placed at the\norigin. Now, imagine that we bring a test charge q from a point R to a\npoint P against the repulsive force on it due to the charge Q. With reference\n\nChapter Two\n\nELECTROSTATIC\n\nPOTENTIAL AND\n\nCAPACITANCE\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n52\n\nto Fig. 2.1, this will happen if Q and q are both positive\nor both negative. For definiteness, let us take Q, q > 0.\n\nTwo remarks may be made here. First, we assume\nthat the test charge q is so small that it does not disturb\nthe original configuration, namely the charge Q at the\norigin (or else, we keep Q fixed at the origin by some\nunspecified force). Second, in bringing the charge q from\nR to P, we apply an external force F\n\next\n just enough to\n\ncounter the repulsive electric force FE (i.e, Fext= –FE).\nThis means there is no net force on or acceleration of\nthe charge q when it is brought from R to P, i.e., it is\nbrought with infinitesimally slow constant speed. In\n\nthis situation, work done by the external force is the negative of the work\ndone by the electric force, and gets fully stored in the form of potential\nenergy of the charge q. If the external force is removed on reaching P, the\nelectric force will take the charge away from Q – the stored energy (potential\nenergy) at P is used to provide kinetic energy to the charge q in such a\nway that the sum of the kinetic and potential energies is conserved.\n\nThus, work done by external forces in moving a charge q from R to P is\n\nW\nRP\n\n =   F rext id\nR\n\nP\n\n∫\n\n        =    −∫ F rE\nR\n\nP\n\ndi  (2.1)\n\nThis work done is against electrostatic repulsive force and gets stored\nas potential energy.\n\nAt every point in electric field, a particle with charge q possesses a\ncertain electrostatic potential energy, this work done increases its potential\nenergy by an amount equal to potential energy difference between points\nR and P.\n\nThus, potential energy difference\n\nP R RPU U U W∆ = − = (2.2)\n(Note here that this displacement is in an opposite sense to the electric\n\nforce and hence work done by electric field is negative, i.e., –W\nRP\n\n.)\nTherefore, we can define electric potential energy difference between\n\ntwo points as the work required to be done by an external force in moving\n(without accelerating) charge q from one point to another for electric field\nof any arbitrary charge configuration.\n\nTwo important comments may be made at this stage:\n(i) The right side of Eq. (2.2) depends only on the initial and final positions\n\nof the charge. It means that the work done by an electrostatic field in\nmoving a charge from one point to another depends only on the initial\nand the final points and is independent of the path taken to go from\none point to the other. This is the fundamental characteristic of a\nconservative force. The concept of the potential energy would not be\nmeaningful if the work depended on the path. The path-independence\nof work done by an electrostatic field can be proved using the\nCoulomb’s law. We omit this proof here.\n\nFIGURE 2.1 A test charge q (> 0) is\nmoved from the point R to the\npoint P against the repulsive\n\nforce on it by the charge Q (> 0)\nplaced at the origin.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectrostatic Potential\n\nand Capacitance\n\n53\n\n(ii) Equation (2.2) defines potential energy difference in terms\nof the physically meaningful quantity work. Clearly,\npotential energy so defined is undetermined to within an\nadditive constant.What this means is that the actual value\nof potential energy is not physically significant; it is only\nthe difference of potential energy that is significant. We can\nalways add an arbitrary constant α to potential energy at\nevery point, since this will not change the potential energy\ndifference:\n\n( ) ( )P R P RU U U Uα α+ − + = −\n\nPut it differently, there is a freedom in choosing the point\nwhere potential energy is zero. A convenient choice is to have\nelectrostatic potential energy zero at infinity. With this choice,\nif we take the point R at infinity, we get from Eq. (2.2)\n\nP P PW U U U∞ ∞= − = (2.3)\n\nSince the point P is arbitrary, Eq. (2.3) provides us with a\ndefinition of potential energy of a charge q at any point.\nPotential energy of charge q at a point (in the presence of field\ndue to any charge configuration) is the work done by the\nexternal force (equal and opposite to the electric force) in\nbringing the charge q from infinity to that point.\n\n2.2  ELECTROSTATIC POTENTIAL\nConsider any general static charge configuration. We define\npotential energy of a test charge q in terms of the work done\non the charge q. This work is obviously proportional to q, since\nthe force at any point is qE, where E is the electric field at that\npoint due to the given charge configuration. It is, therefore,\nconvenient to divide the work by the amount of charge q, so\nthat the resulting quantity is independent of q. In other words,\nwork done per unit test charge is characteristic of the electric\nfield associated with the charge configuration. This leads to\nthe idea of electrostatic potential V due to a given charge\nconfiguration. From Eq. (2.1), we get:\n\nWork done by external force in bringing a unit positive\ncharge from point R to P\n\n= V\nP \n– V\n\nR\n  =\n\n−\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\nU U\n\nq\nP R (2.4)\n\nwhere V\nP \nand V\n\nR\n  are the electrostatic potentials at P and R, respectively.\n\nNote, as before, that it is not the actual value of potential but the potential\ndifference that is physically significant. If, as before, we choose the\npotential to be zero at infinity, Eq. (2.4) implies:\n\nWork done by an external force in bringing a unit positive charge\nfrom infinity to a point = electrostatic potential (V ) at that point.\n\nC\nO\n\nU\nN\n\nT\n A\n\nL\nE\n\nS\nS\n\nA\nN\n\nD\nR\n\nO\n V\n\nO\nL\nT\nA\n\n (1\n7\n4\n5\n –1\n\n8\n2\n7\n)\n\nCount Alessandro Volta\n\n(1745 – 1827) Italian\nphysicist, professor at\nPavia. Volta established\nthat the animal electri-\ncity observed by Luigi\nGalvani, 1737–1798, in\nexperiments with frog\nmuscle tissue placed in\ncontact with dissimilar\nmetals, was not due to\nany exceptional property\nof animal tissues but\nwas also generated\nwhenever any wet body\nwas sandwiched between\ndissimilar metals. This\nled him to develop the\nfirst voltaic  pile , or\nbattery, consisting of a\nlarge stack of moist disks\nof cardboard (electro-\nlyte) sandwiched\nbetween disks of metal\n(electrodes).\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n54\n\nIn other words, the electrostatic potential (V )\nat any point in a region with electrostatic field is\nthe work done in bringing a unit positive\ncharge (without acceleration) from infinity to\nthat point.\n\nThe qualifying remarks made earlier regarding\npotential energy also apply to the definition of\npotential. To obtain the work done per unit test\ncharge, we should take an infinitesimal test charge\nδq, obtain the work done δW in bringing it from\ninfinity to the point and determine the ratio\nδW/δq. Also, the external force at every point of the\npath is to be equal and opposite to the electrostatic\nforce on the test charge at that point.\n\n2.3  POTENTIAL DUE TO A POINT CHARGE\nConsider a point charge Q at the origin (Fig. 2.3). For definiteness, take Q\nto be positive. We wish to determine the potential at any point P with\n\nposition vector r from the origin. For that we must\ncalculate the work done in bringing a unit positive\ntest charge from infinity to the point P. For Q > 0,\nthe work done against the repulsive force on the\ntest charge is positive. Since work done is\nindependent of the path, we choose a convenient\npath – along the radial direction from infinity to\nthe point P.\n\nAt some intermediate point P′ on the path, the\nelectrostatic force on a unit positive charge is\n\n2\n0\n\n1\nˆ\n\n4 '\nQ\n\nrε\n×\n\n′\nπ\n\nr (2.5)\n\nwhere ˆ ′r is the unit vector along OP′.

Total\nwork done (W) by the external force is obtained by integrating Eq.

This\nis equivalent to saying that work\ndone by the electrostatic force in\nbringing the unit positive charge\nform infinity to the point P is\npositive. [This is as it should be,\nsince for Q < 0, the force on a unit\npositive test charge is attractive, so\nthat the electrostatic force and the\ndisplacement (from infinity to P) are\nin the same direction.] Finally, we\nnote that Eq. (2.8) is consistent with\nthe choice that potential at infinity\nbe zero.\n\nFigure (2.4) shows how the electrostatic potential ( ∝ 1/r ) and the\nelectrostatic field ( ∝ 1/r\n\n2 ) varies with r.\n\nExample 2.1\n\n(a) Calculate the potential at a point P due to a charge of 4 × 10–7C\nlocated 9 cm away.\n\n(b) Hence obtain the work done in bringing a charge of 2 × 10–9 C\nfrom infinity to the point P. Does the answer depend on the path\nalong which the charge is brought?\n\nSolution\n\n(a)  \n\n          = 4 × 104 V\n\n(b) W = qV = 2 × 10–9C × 4 × 104V\n     = 8 × 10–5 J\n\nNo, work done will be path independent. Any arbitrary infinitesimal\npath can be resolved into two perpendicular displacements: One along\nr and another perpendicular to r. The work done corresponding to\nthe later will be zero.\n\n2.4  POTENTIAL DUE TO AN ELECTRIC DIPOLE\nAs we learnt in the last chapter, an electric dipole consists of two charges\nq and  –q separated by a (small) distance 2a. Its total charge is zero. It is\ncharacterised by a dipole moment vector p whose magnitude is q × 2a\nand which points in the direction from –q to q (Fig. 2.5). We also saw that\nthe electric field of a dipole at a point with position vector r depends not\njust on the magnitude r, but also on the angle between r and p. Further,\n\nFIGURE 2.4 Variation of potential V with r [in units of\n(Q/4πε0) m\n\n-1] (blue curve) and field with r [in units\nof (Q/4πε0) m\n\n-2] (black curve) for a point charge Q.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n56\n\nthe field falls off, at large distance, not as\n1/r 2 (typical of field due to a single charge)\nbut as 1/r3. We, now, determine the electric\npotential due to a dipole and contrast it\nwith the potential due to a single charge.\n\nAs before, we take the origin at the\ncentre of the dipole. Now we know that the\nelectric field obeys the superposition\nprinciple. Since potential is related to the\nwork done by the field, electrostatic\npotential also follows the superposition\nprinciple. Thus, the potential due to the\ndipole is the sum of potentials due to the\ncharges q and –q\n\nV\nq\n\nr\n\nq\n\nr\n= −\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n1\n4 0 1 2πε\n\n(2.9)\n\nwhere r\n1\n and r\n\n2\n are the distances of the\n\npoint P from q and –q, respectively.\nNow, by geometry,\n\n2 2 2\n1 2r r a ar= + − cosθ\n\n2 2 2\n2 2r r a ar= + +  cosθ (2.10)\n\nWe take r much greater than a ( ar >> ) and retain terms only upto\nthe first order in a/r\n\n  r r\na\n\nr\n\na\n\nr\n1\n2 2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n= − +\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\ncosθ\n\n  ≅ −\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\nr\na\n\nr\n\n2 1\n2 cosθ\n\n(2.11)\n\n Similarly,\n\n  r r\na\n\nr\n2\n2 2 1\n\n2\n≅ +\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\ncosθ\n(2.12)\n\nUsing the Binomial theorem and retaining terms upto the first order\nin a/r ; we obtain,\n\n1 1\n1\n\n2 1\n1\n\n1\n\n1 2\n\nr r\n\na\n\nr r\n\na\n\nr\n≅ −\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n≅ +\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n−\ncos\n\ncos\n/\n\nθ\nθ [2.13(a)]\n\n1 1\n1\n\n2 1\n1\n\n2\n\n1 2\n\nr r\n\na\n\nr r\n\na\n\nr\n≅ +\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n≅ −\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n−\ncos\n\ncos\n/\n\nθ\nθ [2.13(b)]\n\n Using Eqs.

The potential in the\nequatorial plane (θ = π/2) is zero.\n\nThe important contrasting features of electric potential of a dipole\nfrom that due to a single charge are clear from Eqs. (2.8) and (2.15):\n(i) The potential due to a dipole depends not just on r but also on the\n\nangle between the position vector  r and the dipole moment vector p.\n(It is, however, axially symmetric about p. That is, if you rotate the\nposition vector r  about  p, keeping θ fixed, the points corresponding\nto P on the cone so generated will have the same potential as at P.)\n\n(ii) The electric dipole potential falls off, at large distance, as 1/r 2, not as\n1/r, characteristic of the potential due to a single charge. (You can\nrefer to the Fig. 2.5 for graphs of 1/r 2 versus r and 1/r versus r,\ndrawn there in another context.)\n\n2.5  POTENTIAL DUE TO A SYSTEM OF CHARGES\nConsider a system of charges q\n\n1\n, q\n\n2\n,…, q\n\nn\n with position vectors r\n\n1\n, r\n\n2\n,…,\n\nrn relative to some origin (Fig. 2.6).

By the\nsuperposition principle, the potential V at P due\nto the total charge configuration is the algebraic\nsum of the potentials due to the individual\ncharges\n\nV = V1 + V2 + ... + Vn (2.17)\n\nFIGURE 2.6 Potential at a point due to a\nsystem of charges is the sum of potentials\n\ndue to individual charges.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n58  E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 2\n\n.2\n\n= + + +\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n1\n4 0\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2πε\nq\n\nr\n\nq\n\nr\n\nq\n\nr\n\nn\n\nnP P P\n\n...... (2.18)\n\nIf we have a continuous charge distribution characterised by a charge\ndensity ρ (r), we divide it, as before, into small volume elements each of\nsize ∆v and carrying a charge ρ∆v. We then determine the potential due\nto each volume element and sum (strictly speaking , integrate) over all\nsuch contributions, and thus determine the potential due to the entire\ndistribution.\n\nWe have seen in Chapter 1 that for a uniformly charged spherical shell,\nthe electric field outside the shell is as if the entire charge is concentrated\nat the centre.

(There is no\npossibility of potentials due to the two charges adding up to zero for\nx < 0.) If x lies between O and A, we have\n\n1\n\n4\n\n3 10\n10\n\n2 10\n15 10\n\n0\n0\n\n8\n\n2\n\n8\n\n2πε\n×\n×\n\n−\n×\n\n− ×\n=\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ef\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8fb\n\uf8fa\n\n–\n\n–\n\n–\n\n–( )x x\n\nwhere x is in cm.

Note that the\nformula for potential used in the calculation required choosing\npotential to be zero at infinity.\n\nExample 2.3  Figures 2.8 (a) and (b) show the field lines of a positive\nand negative point charge respectively.\n\nFIGURE 2.8\n\n(a) Give the signs of the potential difference VP – VQ; VB – VA.\n\n(b) Give the sign of the potential energy difference of a small negative\ncharge between the points Q and P; A and B.\n\n(c) Give the sign of the work done by the field in moving a small\npositive charge from Q to P.\n\n(d) Give the sign of the work done by the external agency in moving\na small negative charge from B to A.\n\n(e) Does the kinetic energy of a small negative charge increase or\ndecrease in going from B to A?\n\nSolution\n\n(a) As \n1\n\nV\nr\n\n∝ , V\nP\n > V\n\nQ\n. Thus, (V\n\nP \n– V\n\nQ\n) is positive. Also V\n\nB\n is less negative\n\nthan V\nA\n .  Thus, V\n\nB\n > V\n\nA\n or (V\n\nB \n– V\n\nA\n) is positive.\n\n(b) A small negative charge will be attracted towards positive charge.\nThe negative charge moves from higher potential energy to lower\npotential energy. Therefore the sign of potential energy difference\nof a small negative charge between Q and P is positive.\nSimilarly, (P.E.)A > (P.E.)B\n\n and hence sign of potential energy\ndifferences is positive.\n\n(c) In moving a small positive charge from Q to P, work has to be\ndone by an external agency against the electric field. Therefore,\nwork done by the field is negative.\n\n(d) In moving a small negative charge from B to A work has to be\ndone by the external agency.

For a single charge q, the potential is given\nby Eq. (2.8):\n\n1\n4 o\n\nq\nV\n\nrε\n=\n\nπ\nThis shows that V is a constant if r is constant. Thus, equipotential\n\nsurfaces of a single point charge are concentric spherical surfaces centred\nat the charge.\n\nNow the electric field lines for a single charge q are radial lines starting\nfrom or ending at the charge, depending on whether q is positive or negative.\nClearly, the electric field at every point is normal to the equipotential surface\npassing through that point. This is true in general: for any charge\nconfiguration, equipotential surface through a point is normal to the\nelectric field at that point. The proof of this statement is simple.\n\nIf the field were not normal to the equipotential surface, it would\nhave non-zero component along the surface. To move a unit test charge\nagainst the direction of the component of the field, work would have to\nbe done. But this is in contradiction to the definition of an equipotential\nsurface: there is no potential difference between any two points on the\nsurface and no work is required to move a test charge on the surface.\nThe electric field must, therefore, be normal to the equipotential surface\nat every point. Equipotential surfaces offer an alternative visual picture\nin addition to the picture of electric field lines around a charge\nconfiguration.\n\nFIGURE 2.9 For a\nsingle charge q\n\n(a) equipotential\nsurfaces are\n\nspherical surfaces\ncentred at the\ncharge, and\n\n(b) electric field\nlines are radial,\nstarting from the\ncharge if q > 0.\n\nFor a uniform electric field E, say, along the x -axis, the equipotential\nsurfaces are planes normal to the x -axis, i.e., planes parallel to the y-z\nplane (Fig. 2.10). Equipotential surfaces for (a) a dipole and (b) two\nidentical positive charges  are shown in Fig. 2.11.\n\nFIGURE 2.11 Some equipotential surfaces for (a) a dipole,\n(b) two identical positive charges.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectrostatic Potential\n\nand Capacitance\n\n61\n\n2.6.1  Relation between field and potential\n\nConsider two closely spaced equipotential surfaces A and B (Fig. 2.12)\nwith potential values V and V + δ V, where δ V is the change in V in the\ndirection of the electric field E. Let P be a point on the\nsurface B. δ l is the perpendicular distance of the\nsurface A from P. Imagine that a unit positive charge\nis moved along this perpendicular from the surface B\nto surface A against the electric field. The work done\nin this process is |E|δ l.\n\nThis work equals the potential difference\nV\n\nA\n–V\n\nB\n.\n\nThus,\n\n|E|δ l = V – (V + δV )= – δV\n\ni.e., |E|= −\nδ\n\nδ\n\nV\n\nl\n(2.20)\n\nSince δV is negative, δV = – |δV|. we can rewrite\nEq (2.20) as\n\nE = − = +\nδ\n\nδ\n\nδ\n\nδ\n\nV\n\nl\n\nV\n\nl\n(2.21)\n\nWe thus arrive at two important conclusions concerning the relation\nbetween electric field and potential:\n(i) Electric field is in the direction in which the potential decreases\n\nsteepest.\n\n(ii) Its magnitude is given by the change in the magnitude of potential\nper unit displacement normal to the equipotential surface at the point.\n\n2.7  POTENTIAL ENERGY OF A SYSTEM OF CHARGES\nConsider first the simple case of two charges q\n\n1\nand q\n\n2\n with position vector\n\nr1 and r2 relative to some origin. Let us calculate the work done\n(externally) in building up this configuration. This means that we consider\nthe charges q\n\n1\n and q\n\n2\n initially at infinity and determine the work done by\n\nan external agency to bring the charges to the given locations. Suppose,\nfirst the charge q\n\n1\n is brought from infinity to the point r\n\n1\n. There is no\n\nexternal field against which work needs to be done, so work done in\nbringing q1 from infinity to r1 is zero. This charge produces a potential in\nspace given by\n\nV\nq\n\nr\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n4\n\n=\nπε P\n\nwhere r\n1P\n\n is the distance of a point P in space from the location of q\n1\n.\n\nFrom the definition of potential, work done in bringing charge q2 from\ninfinity to the point r\n\n2\n is q\n\n2 \ntimes the potential at r\n\n2\n due to q\n\n1\n:\n\nwork done on q\n2 \n= \n\n1\n4 0\n\n1 2\n\n12πε\nq q\n\nr\n\nFIGURE 2.12 From the\npotential to the field.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n62\n\nwhere r\n12\n\n is the distance between points 1 and 2.\nSince electrostatic force is conservative, this work gets\n\nstored in the form of potential energy of the system. Thus,\nthe potential energy of a system of two charges q\n\n1 \nand q\n\n2\n is\n\nU\nq q\n\nr\n=\n\n1\n4 0\n\n1 2\n\n12πε\n(2.22)\n\nObviously, if q\n2\n was brought first to its present location and\n\nq\n1\n brought later, the potential energy U would be the same.\n\nMore generally, the potential energy expression,\nEq. (2.22), is unaltered whatever way the charges are brought to the specified\nlocations, because of path-independence of work for electrostatic force.\n\nEquation (2.22) is true for any sign of  q1and q2. If q1q2 > 0, potential\nenergy is positive. This is as expected, since for like charges (q\n\n1\nq\n\n2 \n> 0),\n\nelectrostatic force is repulsive and a positive amount of work is needed to\nbe done against this force to bring the charges from infinity to a finite\ndistance apart. For unlike charges (q\n\n1 \nq\n\n2 \n< 0), the electrostatic force is\n\nattractive. In that case, a positive amount of work is needed against this\nforce to take the charges from the given location to infinity. In other words,\na negative amount of work is needed for the reverse path (from infinity to\nthe present locations), so the potential energy is negative.\n\nEquation (2.22) is easily generalised for a system of any number of\npoint charges. Let us calculate the potential energy of a system of three\ncharges q\n\n1\n,\n \nq\n\n2 \nand q\n\n3\n located at r\n\n1\n,\n \nr\n\n2\n, r\n\n3\n, respectively. To bring q\n\n1\n first\n\nfrom infinity to r1, no work is required. Next we bring q2 from infinity to\nr\n\n2\n.

The electrostatic potential at\nE is clearly zero since potential due to A and C is cancelled by that\ndue to B and D. Hence, no work is required to bring any charge to\npoint E.\n\n2.8  POTENTIAL ENERGY IN AN EXTERNAL FIELD\n\n2.8.1  Potential energy of a single charge\n\nIn Section 2.7, the source of the electric field was specified – the charges\nand their locations - and the potential energy of the system of those charges\nwas  determined. In this section, we ask a related but a distinct question.\nWhat is the potential energy of a charge q in a given field? This question\nwas, in fact, the starting point that led us to the notion of the electrostatic\npotential (Sections 2.1 and 2.2). But here we address this question again\nto clarify in what way it is different from the discussion in Section 2.7.\n\nThe main difference is that we are now concerned with the potential\nenergy of a charge (or charges) in an external field. The external field E is\nnot produced by the given charge(s) whose potential energy we wish to\ncalculate. E is produced by sources external to the given charge(s).The\nexternal sources may be known, but often they are unknown or\nunspecified; what is specified is the electric field E or the electrostatic\npotential V due to the external sources. We assume that the charge q\ndoes not significantly affect the sources producing the external field. This\nis true if q is very small, or the external sources are held fixed by other\nunspecified forces. Even if q is finite, its influence on the external sources\nmay still be ignored in the situation when very strong sources far away\nat infinity produce a finite field E in the region of interest. Note again that\nwe are interested in determining the potential energy of a given charge q\n(and later, a system of charges) in the external field; we are not interested\nin the potential energy of the sources producing the external electric field.\n\nThe external electric field E and the corresponding external potential\nV may vary from point to point. By definition, V at a point P is the work\ndone in bringing a unit positive charge from infinity to the point P.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectrostatic Potential\n\nand Capacitance\n\n65\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 2\n\n.5\n\n(We continue to take potential at infinity to be zero.) Thus, work done in\nbringing a charge q from infinity to the point P in the external field is qV.\nThis work is stored in the form of potential energy of q. If the point P has\nposition vector r relative to some origin, we can write:\n\nPotential energy of q at r in an external field\n\n= qV (r) (2.27)\n\nwhere V(r) is the external potential at the point r.\nThus, if an electron with charge q = e = 1.6×10–19 C is accelerated by\n\na potential difference of ∆V = 1 volt, it would gain energy of q∆V = 1.6 ×\n10–19J. This unit of energy is defined as 1 electron volt or 1eV, i.e.,\n1 eV=1.6 × 10–19J. The units based on eV are most commonly used in\natomic, nuclear and particle physics, (1 keV = 103eV = 1.6 × 10–16J, 1 MeV\n= 106eV = 1.6 × 10–13J, 1 GeV = 109eV = 1.6 × 10–10J and 1 TeV = 1012eV\n= 1.6 × 10–7J). [This has already been defined on Page 117, XI Physics\nPart I, Table 6.1.]\n\n2.8.2 Potential energy of a system of two charges in an\nexternal field\n\nNext, we ask: what is the potential energy of a system of two charges q1\nand q\n\n2 \nlocated at r\n\n1\nand r\n\n2\n, respectively, in an external field? First, we\n\ncalculate the work done in bringing the charge q\n1\n from infinity to r\n\n1\n.\n\nWork done in this step is q1 V(r1), using Eq. (2.27). Next, we consider the\nwork done in bringing q\n\n2 \nto r\n\n2\n. In this step, work is done not only against\n\nthe external field E but also against the field due to q\n1\n.\n\nWork done on q2 against the external field\n= q\n\n2 \nV (r\n\n2\n)\n\nWork done on q\n2 \nagainst the field due to q\n\n1\n\n1 2\n\n12\n4 o\n\nq q\n\nrε\n=\n\nπ\nwhere  r\n\n12 \nis the distance between q\n\n1 \nand q\n\n2\n. We have made use of Eqs.\n\n(2.27) and (2.22). By the superposition principle for fields, we add up\nthe work done on q2 against the two fields (E and that due to q1):\n\nWork done in bringing q\n2 \nto r\n\n2\n\n1 2\n\n2 2\n\n12\n\n( )\n4 o\n\nq q\nq V\n\nrε\n= +\n\nπ\nr (2.28)\n\nThus,\n Potential energy of the system\n= the total work done in assembling the configuration\n\n1 2\n\n1 1 2 2\n\n0 12\n\n( ) ( )\n4\n\nq q\nq V q V\n\nrε\n= + +\n\nπ\nr r  (2.29)\n\nExample 2.5\n\n(a) Determine the electrostatic potential energy of a system consisting\nof  two charges 7 µC and –2 µC (and with no external field) placed\nat (–9 cm, 0, 0) and (9 cm, 0, 0) respectively.\n\n(b) How much work is required to separate the two charges infinitely\naway from each other?\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n66\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 2\n\n.5\n\n(c) Suppose that the same system of charges is now placed in an\nexternal electric field E = A (1/r 2); A = 9 × 105 NC–1 m2.

Suppose an external torque τττττext is\napplied in such a manner that it just neutralises this\ntorque and rotates it in the plane of paper from angle θ0\nto angle θ1 at an infinitesimal angular speed and without\nangular acceleration. The amount of work done by the\nexternal torque will be given by\n\n( )cos cospE θ θ0 1= − (2.31)\nThis work is stored as the potential energy of the system. We can\n\nthen associate potential energy U(θ ) with an inclination θ  of the dipole.\nSimilar to other potential energies, there is a freedom in choosing the\nangle where the potential energy U is taken to be zero. A natural choice\nis to take θ0 = π / 2. (Αn explanation for it is provided towards the end of\ndiscussion.)  We can then write,\n\n(2.32)\n\nFIGURE 2.16 Potential energy of a\ndipole in a uniform external field.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectrostatic Potential\n\nand Capacitance\n\n67\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 2\n\n.6\n\nThis expression can alternately be understood also from Eq.

This must be the energy released\nby the substance in the form of heat in aligning its dipoles.\n\n2.9  ELECTROSTATICS OF CONDUCTORS\nConductors and insulators were described briefly in Chapter 1.\nConductors contain mobile charge carriers. In metallic conductors, these\ncharge carriers are electrons. In a metal, the outer (valence) electrons\npart away from their atoms and are free to move. These electrons are free\nwithin the metal but not free  to leave the metal. The free electrons form a\nkind of ‘gas’; they collide with each other and with the ions, and move\nrandomly in different directions. In an external electric field, they drift\nagainst the direction of the field. The positive ions made up of the nuclei\nand the bound electrons remain held in their fixed positions. In electrolytic\nconductors, the charge carriers are both positive and negative ions; but\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n68\n\nthe situation in this case is more involved – the movement of the charge\ncarriers is affected both by the external electric field as also by the\nso-called chemical forces (see Chapter 3). We shall restrict our discussion\nto metallic solid conductors. Let us note important results regarding\nelectrostatics of conductors.\n\n1. Inside a conductor, electrostatic field is zero\n\nConsider a conductor, neutral or charged. There may also be an external\nelectrostatic field. In the static situation, when there is no current inside\nor on the surface of the conductor, the electric field is zero everywhere\ninside the conductor. This fact can be taken as the defining property of a\nconductor. A conductor has free electrons. As long as electric field is not\nzero, the free charge carriers would experience force and drift. In the\nstatic situation, the free charges have so distributed themselves that the\nelectric field is zero everywhere inside. Electrostatic field is zero inside a\nconductor.\n\n2. At the surface of a charged conductor, electrostatic field\nmust be normal to the surface at every point\n\nIf E were not normal to the surface, it would have some non-zero\ncomponent along the surface. Free charges on the surface of the conductor\nwould then experience force and move. In the static situation, therefore,\nE should have no tangential component. Thus electrostatic field at the\nsurface of a charged conductor must be normal to the surface at every\n\npoint. (For a conductor without any surface charge density, field is zero\neven at the surface.) See result 5.\n\n3. The interior of a conductor can have no excess charge in\nthe static situation\n\nA neutral conductor has equal amounts of positive and negative charges\nin every small volume or surface element. When the conductor is charged,\nthe excess charge can reside only on the surface in the static situation.\nThis follows from the Gauss’s law. Consider any arbitrary volume element\nv inside a conductor. On the closed surface S bounding the volume\nelement v, electrostatic field is zero. Thus the total electric flux through S\nis zero. Hence, by Gauss’s law, there is no net charge enclosed by S. But\nthe surface S can be made as small as you like, i.e., the volume v can be\nmade vanishingly small. This means there is no net charge at any point\ninside the conductor, and any excess charge must reside at the surface.\n\n4. Electrostatic potential is constant throughout the volume\nof the conductor and has the same value (as inside) on\nits surface\n\nThis follows from results 1 and 2 above. Since E = 0 inside the conductor\nand has no tangential component on the surface, no work is done in\nmoving a small test charge within the conductor and on its surface. That\nis, there is no potential difference between any two points inside or on\nthe surface of the conductor. Hence, the result. If the conductor is charged,\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectrostatic Potential\n\nand Capacitance\n\n69\n\nelectric field normal to the surface exists; this means potential will be\ndifferent for the surface and a point just outside the surface.\n\nIn a system of conductors of arbitrary size, shape and\ncharge configuration, each conductor is characterised by a constant\nvalue of potential, but this constant may differ from one conductor to\nthe other.\n\n5. Electric field at the surface of a charged conductor\n\n0\n\nˆ\nσ\nε\n\n=E n (2.35)\n\nwhere σ is the surface charge density and n̂  is a unit vector normal\nto the surface in the outward direction.\n\nTo derive the result, choose a pill box (a short cylinder) as the Gaussian\nsurface about any point P on the surface, as shown in Fig. 2.17. The pill\nbox is partly inside and partly outside the surface of the conductor. It\nhas a small area of cross section δ S and negligible height.\n\nJust inside the surface, the electrostatic field is zero; just outside, the\nfield is normal to the surface with magnitude E. Thus,\nthe contribution to the total flux through the pill box\ncomes only from the outside (circular) cross-section\nof the pill box. This equals  ± EδS (positive for σ > 0,\nnegative for σ < 0), since over the small area δS, E\nmay be considered constant and E and δS are parallel\nor antiparallel. The charge enclosed by the pill box\nis  σδS.\nBy Gauss’s law\n\nEδS = \n0\n\nSσ δ\nε\n\nE = \n0\n\nσ\nε\n\n(2.36)\n\nIncluding the fact that electric field is normal to the\nsurface, we get the vector relation, Eq. (2.35), which\nis true for both signs of σ. For σ > 0, electric field is\nnormal to the surface outward; for σ < 0, electric field\nis normal to the surface inward.\n\n6. Electrostatic shielding\n\nConsider a conductor with a cavity, with no charges inside the cavity. A\nremarkable result is that the electric field inside the cavity is zero, whatever\nbe the size and shape of the cavity and whatever be the charge on the\nconductor and the external fields in which it might be placed. We have\nproved a simple case of this result already: the electric field inside a charged\nspherical shell is zero. The proof of the result for the shell makes use of\nthe spherical symmetry of the shell (see Chapter 1). But the vanishing of\nelectric field in the (charge-free) cavity of a conductor is, as mentioned\nabove, a very general result. A related result is that even if the conductor\n\nFIGURE 2.17 The Gaussian surface\n(a pill box) chosen to derive Eq. (2.35)\n\nfor electric field at the surface of a\ncharged conductor.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n70  E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 2\n\n.7\n\nFIGURE 2.18 The electric field inside a\ncavity of any conductor is zero. All\n\ncharges reside only on the outer surface\nof a conductor with cavity. (There are no\n\ncharges placed in the cavity.)\n\nis charged or charges are induced on a neutral\nconductor by an external field, all charges reside\nonly on the outer surface of a conductor with cavity.\n\nThe proofs of the results noted in Fig. 2.18 are\nomitted here, but we note their important\nimplication. Whatever be the charge and field\nconfiguration outside, any cavity in a conductor\nremains shielded from outside electric influence: the\nfield inside the cavity is always zero. This is known\nas electrostatic shielding. The effect can be made\nuse of in protecting sensitive instruments from\noutside electrical influence. Figure 2.19 gives a\nsummary of the important electrostatic properties\nof a conductor.\n\nExample 2.7\n(a) A comb run through one’s dry hair attracts small bits of paper.\n\nWhy?\nWhat happens if the hair is wet or if it is a rainy day?

Why?\n\n(d) A bird perches on a bare high power line, and nothing happens\nto the bird. A man standing on the ground touches the same line\nand gets a fatal shock. Why?\n\nSolution\n(a) This is because the comb gets charged by friction. The molecules\n\nin the paper gets polarised by the charged comb, resulting  in a\nnet force of attraction. If the hair is wet, or if it is rainy day, friction\nbetween hair and the comb reduces. The comb does not get\ncharged and thus it will not attract small bits of paper.\n\nFIGURE 2.19 Some important electrostatic properties of a conductor.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectrostatic Potential\n\nand Capacitance\n\n71\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 2\n\n.7\n\n(b) To enable them to conduct charge (produced by friction) to the\nground;  as too much of static electricity accumulated may result\nin spark and result in fire.\n\n(c) Reason similar to (b).\n\n(d) Current passes only when there is difference in potential.\n\n2.10  DIELECTRICS AND POLARISATION\nDielectrics are non-conducting substances. In contrast to conductors,\nthey have no (or negligible number of ) charge carriers. Recall from Section\n2.9 what happens when a conductor is placed in an\nexternal electric field. The free charge carriers move\nand charge distribution in the conductor adjusts\nitself in such a way that the electric field due to\ninduced charges opposes the external field within\nthe conductor. This happens until, in the static\nsituation, the two fields cancel each other and the\nnet electrostatic field in the conductor is zero. In a\ndielectric, this free movement of charges is not\npossible. It turns out that the external field induces\ndipole moment by stretching or re-orienting\nmolecules of the dielectric. The collective effect of all\nthe molecular dipole moments is net charges on the\nsurface of the dielectric which produce a field that\nopposes the external field. Unlike in a conductor,\nhowever, the opposing field so induced does not\nexactly cancel the external field. It only reduces it.\nThe extent of the effect depends on the\nnature of the dielectric. To understand the\neffect, we need to look at the charge\ndistribution of a dielectric at the\nmolecular level.\n\nThe molecules of a substance may be\npolar or non-polar. In a non-polar\nmolecule, the centres of positive and\nnegative charges coincide. The molecule\nthen has no permanent (or intrinsic) dipole\nmoment. Examples of non-polar molecules\nare oxygen (O\n\n2\n) and hydrogen (H\n\n2\n)\n\nmolecules which, because of their\nsymmetry, have no dipole moment. On the\nother hand, a polar molecule is one in which\nthe centres of positive and negative charges\nare separated (even when there is no\nexternal field). Such molecules have a\npermanent dipole moment. An ionic\nmolecule such as HCl or a molecule of water\n(H\n\n2\nO) are examples of polar molecules.\n\nFIGURE 2.20 Difference in behaviour\nof a conductor and a dielectric\n\nin an external electric field.\n\nFIGURE 2.21 Some examples of polar\nand non-polar molecules.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n72\n\nIn an external electric field, the\npositive and negative charges of a non-\npolar molecule are displaced in opposite\ndirections. The displacement stops when\nthe external force on the constituent\ncharges of the molecule is balanced by\nthe restoring force (due to internal fields\nin the molecule). The non-polar molecule\nthus develops an induced dipole moment.\nThe dielectric is said to be polarised by\nthe external field. We consider only the\nsimple situation when the induced dipole\nmoment is in the direction of the field and\nis proportional to the field strength.\n(Substances for which this assumption\nis true are called l inear isotropic\ndielectrics.) The induced dipole moments\nof different molecules add up giving a net\ndipole moment of the dielectric in the\npresence of the external field.\n\nA dielectric with polar molecules also\ndevelops a net dipole moment in an\nexternal field, but for a different reason.\nIn the absence of any external field, the\ndifferent permanent dipoles are oriented\nrandomly due to thermal agitation; so\nthe total dipole moment is zero. When\n\nan external field is applied, the individual dipole moments tend  to align\nwith the field. When summed overall the molecules, there is then a net\ndipole moment in the direction of the external field, i.e., the dielectric is\npolarised. The extent of polarisation depends on the relative strength of\ntwo mutually opposite factors: the dipole potential energy in the external\nfield tending to align the dipoles with the field and thermal energy tending\nto disrupt the alignment. There may be, in addition, the  ‘induced dipole\nmoment’ effect as for non-polar molecules, but generally the alignment\neffect is more important for polar molecules.\n\nThus in either case, whether polar or non-polar, a dielectric develops\na net dipole moment in the presence of an external field. The dipole\nmoment per unit volume is called polarisation and is denoted by P. For\nlinear isotropic dielectrics,\n\n0ε χ=P Ee (2.37)\nwhere χ\n\ne\n is a constant characteristic of the dielectric and is known as the\n\nelectric susceptibility of the dielectric medium.\nIt is possible to relate χ\n\ne\n to the molecular properties of the substance,\n\nbut we shall not pursue that here.\nThe question is: how does the polarised dielectric modify the original\n\nexternal field inside it? Let us consider, for simplicity, a rectangular\ndielectric slab placed in a uniform external field E0 parallel to two of its\nfaces. The field causes a uniform polarisation P of the dielectric. Thus\n\nFIGURE 2.22 A dielectric develops a net dipole\nmoment in an external electric field. (a) Non-polar\n\nmolecules, (b) Polar molecules.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectrostatic Potential\n\nand Capacitance\n\n73\n\nevery volume element ∆v of the slab has a dipole moment\nP ∆v in the direction of the field. The volume element ∆v  is\nmacroscopically small but contains a very large number of\nmolecular dipoles. Anywhere inside the dielectric, the\nvolume element ∆v has no net charge (though it has net\ndipole moment). This is, because, the positive charge of one\ndipole sits close to the negative charge of the adjacent dipole.\nHowever, at the surfaces of the dielectric normal to the\nelectric field, there is evidently a net charge density. As seen\nin Fig 2.23, the positive ends of the dipoles remain\nunneutralised at the right surface and the negative ends at\nthe left surface. The unbalanced charges are the induced\ncharges due to the external field.\n\nThus, the polarised dielectric is equivalent to two charged\nsurfaces with induced surface charge densities, say σ\n\np\n\nand –σ\np\n. Clearly, the field produced by these surface charges\n\nopposes the external field. The total field in the dielectric\nis, thereby, reduced from the case when no dielectric is\npresent. We should note that the surface charge density\n±σ\n\np \narises from bound (not free charges) in the dielectric.\n\n2.11  CAPACITORS AND CAPACITANCE\nA capacitor is a system of two conductors separated by an insulator\n(Fig. 2.24). The conductors have charges, say Q\n\n1\n and Q\n\n2\n, and potentials\n\nV1 and V2. Usually, in practice, the two conductors have charges Q\nand – Q, with potential difference V = V\n\n1\n – V\n\n2\n between them. We shall\n\nconsider only this kind of charge configuration of the capacitor. (Even a\nsingle conductor can be used as a capacitor by assuming the other at\ninfinity.) The conductors may be so charged by connecting them to the\ntwo terminals of a battery. Q is called the charge of the capacitor, though\nthis, in fact, is the charge on one of the conductors – the total charge  of\nthe capacitor  is zero.\n\nThe electric field in the region between the\nconductors is proportional to the charge Q. That\nis, if the charge on the capacitor is, say  doubled,\nthe electric field will also be doubled at every point.\n(This follows from the direct proportionality\nbetween field and charge implied by Coulomb’s\nlaw and the superposition principle.) Now,\npotential difference V is the work done per unit\npositive charge in taking a small test charge from\nthe conductor 2 to 1 against the field.\nConsequently, V is also proportional to Q, and the\nratio Q/V is a constant:\n\nQ\nC\n\nV\n= (2.38)\n\nThe constant C is called the capacitance of the capacitor. C is independent\nof Q or V, as stated above. The capacitance C depends only on the\n\nFIGURE 2.23 A uniformly\npolarised dielectric amounts\nto induced surface charge\n\ndensity, but no volume\ncharge density.\n\nFIGURE 2.24 A system of two conductors\nseparated by an insulator forms a capacitor.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n74\n\ngeometrical configuration (shape, size, separation) of the system of two\nconductors. [As we shall see later, it also depends on the nature of the\ninsulator (dielectric) separating the two conductors.]  The SI unit of\ncapacitance is 1 farad (=1 coulomb volt-1) or 1 F = 1 C V –1. A capacitor\nwith fixed capacitance is symbolically shown as ---||---, while the one with\nvariable capacitance is shown as  .\n\nEquation (2.38) shows that for large C, V is small for a given Q. This\nmeans a capacitor with large capacitance can hold large amount of charge\nQ at a relatively small V. This is of practical importance. High potential\ndifference implies strong electric field around the conductors. A strong\nelectric field can ionise the surrounding air and accelerate the charges so\nproduced to the oppositely charged plates, thereby neutralising the charge\non the capacitor plates, at least partly. In other words, the charge of the\ncapacitor leaks away due to the reduction in insulating power of the\nintervening medium.\n\nThe maximum electric field that a dielectric medium can withstand\nwithout break-down (of its insulating property) is called its dielectric\nstrength; for air it is about 3 × 106 Vm–1. For a separation between\nconductors of the order of 1 cm or so, this field corresponds to a potential\ndifference of 3 × 104 V between the conductors. Thus, for a capacitor to\nstore a large amount of charge without  leaking, its capacitance should\nbe high enough so that the potential difference and hence the electric\nfield do not exceed the break-down limits. Put differently, there is a limit\nto the amount of charge that can be stored on a given capacitor without\nsignificant leaking. In practice, a farad is a very big unit; the most common\nunits are its sub-multiples 1 µF = 10–6 F, 1 nF = 10–9 F, 1 pF = 10–12 F,\netc. Besides its use in storing charge, a capacitor is a key element of most\nac circuits with important functions, as described in Chapter 7.\n\n2.12  THE PARALLEL PLATE CAPACITOR\nA parallel plate capacitor consists of two large plane parallel conducting\nplates separated by a small distance (Fig. 2.25). We first take the\n\nintervening medium between the plates to be\nvacuum. The effect of a dielectric medium between\nthe plates is discussed in the next section. Let A be\nthe area of each plate and d the separation between\nthem. The two plates have charges Q and –Q. Since\nd is much smaller than the linear dimension of the\nplates (d2 << A), we can use the result on electric\nfield by an infinite plane sheet of uniform surface\ncharge density (Section 1.15). Plate 1 has surface\ncharge density σ = Q/A and plate 2 has a surface\ncharge density –σ. Using Eq. (1.33), the electric field\nin different regions is:\n\nOuter region I (region  above the plate 1),\n\n0 0\n\n0\n2 2\n\nE\nσ σ\nε ε\n\n= − = (2.39)\n\nFIGURE 2.25  The parallel plate capacitor.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectrostatic Potential\n\nand Capacitance\n\n75\n\nOuter region II (region below the plate 2),\n\n0 0\n\n0\n2 2\n\nE\nσ σ\nε ε\n\n= − = (2.40)\n\nIn the inner region between the plates 1 and 2, the electric fields due\nto the two charged plates add up, giving\n\n0 0 0 02 2\nQ\n\nE\nA\n\nσ σ σ\nε ε ε ε\n\n= + = = (2.41)\n\nThe direction of electric field is from the positive to the negative plate.\nThus, the electric field is localised between the two plates and is\n\nuniform throughout. For plates with finite area, this will not be true near\nthe outer boundaries of the plates. The field lines bend outward at the\nedges — an effect called ‘fringing of the field’. By the same token, σ will\nnot be strictly uniform on the entire plate. [E and σ are related by Eq.\n(2.35).] However, for d2 << A, these effects can be ignored in the regions\nsufficiently far from the edges, and the field there is given by Eq. (2.41).\nNow for uniform electric field, potential difference is simply the electric\nfield times the distance between the plates, that is,\n\n0\n\n1 Qd\nV E d\n\nAε\n= = (2.42)\n\nThe capacitance C of the parallel plate capacitor is then\n\nQ\nC\n\nV\n=  = \n\n0A\n\nd\n\nε\n= (2.43)\n\nwhich, as expected, depends only on the geometry of the system.

As before, we\nhave two large plates, each of area A, separated by a distance d. The\ncharge on the plates is ±Q, corresponding to the charge density ±σ (with\nσ = Q/A).

(2.54) for the case of a parallel plate capacitor, it holds good for any\ntype of capacitor and can, in fact, be viewed in general as a definition of\nthe dielectric constant of a substance.\n\nELECTRIC DISPLACEMENT\n\nWe have introduced the notion of dielectric constant and arrived at Eq. (2.54), without\ngiving the explicit relation between the induced charge density σp and the polarisation P.\n\nWe take without proof the result that\n\nP\nˆσ •= P n\n\nwhere n̂  is a unit vector along the outward normal to the surface. Above equation is\ngeneral, true for any shape of the dielectric. For the slab in Fig. 2.23, P is along n̂  at the\nright surface and opposite to n̂  at the left surface. Thus at the right surface, induced\ncharge density is positive and at the left surface, it is negative, as guessed already in our\nqualitative discussion before.

It is a\n\nvector quantity. Thus,\n\nD = ε0 E + P, D ˆ• n  = σ,\nThe significance of D is this : in vacuum, E is related to the free charge density σ.\n\nWhen a dielectric medium is present, the corresponding role is taken up by D. For a\ndielectric medium, it is D not E that is directly related to free charge density σ, as seen in\nabove equation. Since P is in the same direction as E, all the three vectors P, E and D are\nparallel.\n\nThe ratio of the magnitudes of D and E is\n\n0\n0\n\nP\n\nD\nK\n\nE\n\nσε\nε\n\nσ σ\n= =\n\n−\n\nThus,\nD = ε\n\n0\n K E\n\nand P = D –ε0E = ε0 (K –1)E\nThis gives for the electric susceptibility χ\n\ne\n defined in Eq.

How is the capacitance\nchanged when the slab is inserted between the plates?\n\nSolution Let  E0 = V0/d be the electric field between the plates when\nthere is no dielectric and the potential difference is V0. If the dielectric\nis now inserted, the electric field in the dielectric will be E = E0/K.\nThe potential difference will then be\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n78\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 2\n\n.8\n\n0\n0\n\n1 3\n( ) ( )\n4 4\n\nE\nV E d d\n\nK\n= +\n\n0 0\n\n1 3 3\n( )\n4 4 4\n\nK\nE d V\n\nK K\n\n+\n= + =\n\nThe potential difference decreases by the factor (K + 3)/4K while the\nfree charge Q0 on the plates remains unchanged.

The effective capacitance\ndepends on the way the individual capacitors are combined. Two simple\npossibilities are discussed below.\n\n2.14.1  Capacitors in series\n\nFigure 2.26 shows capacitors C1 and C2 combined in series.\nThe left plate of C\n\n1 \nand the right plate of C\n\n2 \nare connected to two\n\nterminals of a battery and have charges Q and –Q ,\nrespectively. It then follows that the right plate of C1\nhas charge –Q and the left plate of C\n\n2 \n has charge Q.\n\nIf this was not so, the net charge on each capacitor\nwould not be zero. This would result in an electric\nfield in the conductor connecting C\n\n1\nand C\n\n2\n. Charge\n\nwould flow until the net charge on both C\n1 \nand C\n\n2\nis zero and there is no electric field in the conductor\nconnecting C\n\n1 \nand C\n\n2\n.\n \nThus, in the series\n\ncombination, charges on the two plates (±Q) are the\nsame on each capacitor. The total potential drop V\nacross the combination is the sum of the potential\ndrops V\n\n1\n and V\n\n2 \nacross C\n\n1\n and C\n\n2\n,\n \nrespectively.\n\nV = V\n1\n + V\n\n2\n = \n\n1 2\n\nQ Q\n\nC C\n+ (2.55)\n\ni.e., \n1 2\n\n1 1V\nQ C C\n\n= + , (2.56)\n\nNow we can regard the combination as an\neffective capacitor with charge Q and potential\ndifference V. The effective capacitance of the\ncombination is\n\nQ\nC\n\nV\n= (2.57)\n\nWe compare Eq. (2.57) with Eq.

In this case, the same potential difference is\napplied across both the capacitors. But the plate charges\n(±Q1) on capacitor 1 and the plate charges (±Q2) on the\ncapacitor 2 are not necessarily the same:\n\nQ\n1\n = C\n\n1\nV, Q\n\n2\n = C\n\n2\nV (2.61)\n\nThe equivalent capacitor is one with charge\nQ = Q1 + Q2 (2.62)\nand potential difference V.\nQ = CV = C\n\n1\nV + C\n\n2\nV (2.63)\n\nThe effective capacitance C is, from Eq. (2.63),\nC = C\n\n1\n + C\n\n2\n(2.64)\n\nThe general formula for effective capacitance C for\nparallel combination of n capacitors [Fig. 2.28 (b)]\nfollows similarly,\n\nQ = Q\n1\n + Q\n\n2 \n+ ... + Q\n\nn\n(2.65)\n\ni.e., CV = C\n1\nV + C\n\n2\nV + ...

Determine (a) the equivalent capacitance\nof the network and (b) the charge on each capacitor. (Note, the charge\non a capacitor is the charge on the plate with higher potential, equal\nand opposite to the charge on the plate with lower potential.)\n\nFIGURE 2.28 Parallel combination of\n(a) two capacitors, (b) n capacitors.\n\nFIGURE 2.29\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n80\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 2\n\n.9\n\nSolution\n(a) In the given network, C1, C2 and C3 are connected in series.

To determine the energy stored in this configuration,\nconsider initially two uncharged conductors 1 and 2. Imagine next a\nprocess of transferring charge from conductor 2 to conductor 1 bit by\n\nbit, so that at the end, conductor 1 gets charge Q. By\ncharge conservation, conductor 2 has charge –Q at\nthe end (Fig 2.30 ).\n\nIn transferring positive charge from conductor 2\nto conductor 1, work will be done externally, since at\nany stage conductor 1 is at a higher potential than\nconductor 2. To calculate the total work done, we first\ncalculate the work done in a small step involving\ntransfer of an infinitesimal (i.e., vanishingly small)\namount of charge. Consider the intermediate situation\nwhen the conductors 1 and 2 have charges Q′ and\n–Q′ respectively. At this stage, the potential difference\nV′ between conductors 1 to 2 is Q′/C, where C is the\ncapacitance of the system. Next imagine that a small\ncharge δ Q′ is transferred from conductor 2 to 1. Work\ndone in this step (δ W), resulting in charge Q ′ on\nconductor 1 increasing to Q′+ δ Q′, is given by\n\nQ\nW V Q Q\n\nC\nδ δ δ\n\n′\n= =′ ′ ′ (2.68)\n\nFIGURE 2.30 (a) Work done in a small\nstep of building charge on conductor 1\nfrom Q′ to Q′ + δ Q′. (b)  Total work done\n\nin charging the capacitor may be\nviewed as stored in the energy of\nelectric field between the plates.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectrostatic Potential\n\nand Capacitance\n\n81\n\nSince δ Q′ can be made as small as we like, Eq. (2.68) can be written  as\n\n2 21\n[( ) ]\n\n2\nW Q Q Q\n\nC\nδ δ= + −′ ′ ′ (2.69)\n\nEquations (2.68) and (2.69) are identical because the term of second\n\norder in δ Q′, i.e., δ Q′ 2/2C, is negligible, since δ Q′ is arbitrarily small. The\ntotal work done (W ) is the sum of the small work (δ W ) over the very large\nnumber of steps involved in building the charge Q′ from zero to Q.\n\nW W= ∑ δ\nsum over all steps\n\n     = \n1\n\n2\n\n2 2\n\nC\nQ Q Q\n\nsum over all steps\n\n∑ ′ + ′ − ′[( ) ]δ (2.70)\n\n     = \n2 2 21\n\n[{ 0} {(2 ) }\n2\n\nQ Q Q\nC\n\nδ δ δ− + −′ ′ ′ 2 2{(3 ) (2 ) } ...Q Qδ δ+ − +′ ′\n\n     2 2{ ( ) }]δ+ − −Q Q Q' (2.71)\n\n     \n\n2\n\n21\n[ 0]\n\n2 2\n\nQ\nQ\n\nC C\n= − = (2.72)\n\nThe same result can be obtained directly from Eq.

(2.72) in different ways\n\n2\n\n21 1\n\n2 2 2\n\nQ\nW CV QV\n\nC\n= = = (2.73)\n\nSince electrostatic force is conservative, this work is stored in the form\n\nof potential energy of the system. For the same reason, the final result for\n\npotential energy [Eq. (2.73)] is independent of the manner in which the\n\ncharge configuration of the capacitor is built up. When the capacitor\n\ndischarges, this stored-up energy is released. It is possible to view the\n\npotential energy of the capacitor as ‘stored’ in the electric field between\n\nthe plates. To see this, consider for simplicity, a parallel plate capacitor\n\n[of area A (of each plate) and separation d between the plates].\n\nEnergy stored in the capacitor\n\n= \n\n2 2\n\n0\n\n1 ( )\n\n2 2\n\nQ A d\n\nC A\n\nσ\nε\n\n= × (2.74)\n\nThe surface charge density σ is related to the electric field E between\nthe plates,\n\n0\n\nE\nσ\nε\n\n= (2.75)\n\nFrom Eqs.

(2.77) for the case of a parallel plate capacitor,\nthe result on energy density of an electric field is, in fact, very general and\nholds true for electric field due to any configuration of charges.\n\nExample 2.10 (a) A 900 pF capacitor is charged by 100 V battery\n[Fig. 2.31(a)].

Electrostatic force is a conservative force. Work done by an external\nforce (equal and opposite to the electrostatic force) in bringing a charge\nq from a point R to a point P is q(VP–VR), which is the difference in\npotential energy of charge q between the final and initial points.\n\n2. Potential at a point is the work done per unit charge (by an external\nagency) in bringing a charge from infinity to that point. Potential at a\npoint is arbitrary to within an additive constant, since it is the potential\ndifference between two points which is physically significant. If potential\nat infinity is chosen to be zero; potential at a point with position vector\nr due to a point charge Q placed at the origin is given is given by\n\n1\n( )\n\n4 o\n\nQ\nV\n\nrε\n=\n\nπ\nr\n\n3. The electrostatic potential at a point with position vector r due to a\npoint dipole of dipole moment p placed at the origin is\n\n2\n\nˆ1\n( )\n\n4 ε\n=\n\nπ\np.r\n\nr\no\n\nV\nr\n\nThe result is true also for a dipole (with charges –q and q separated by\n2a)  for r >> a.\n\n4. For a charge configuration q\n1\n, q\n\n2\n, ..., q\n\nn\n with position vectors r\n\n1\n,\n\nr\n2\n, ... r\n\nn\n, the potential at a point P is given by the superposition principle\n\n1 2\n\n0 1P 2P P\n\n1\n( ... )\n\n4\nn\n\nn\n\nqq q\nV\n\nr r rε\n= + + +\n\nπ\n\nwhere r\n1P\n\n is the distance between q\n1\n and P, as and so on.\n\n5. An equipotential surface is a surface over which potential has a constant\nvalue. For a point charge, concentric spheres centred at a location of the\ncharge are equipotential surfaces. The electric field E at a point is\nperpendicular to the equipotential surface through the point. E is in the\ndirection of the steepest decrease of potential.\n\ncharge on each capacitor is then Q ′ = CV ′. By charge\nconservation, Q′  = Q/2. This implies V′  = V/2. The total energy\n\nof the system is 6\n1 1\n\n2 ' ' 2.25 10 J\n2 4\n\nQ V QV\n−= × = = ×\n\nThus in going from (a) to (b), though no charge is lost; the final\nenergy is only half the initial energy. Where has the remaining\nenergy gone?\nThere is a transient period before the system settles to the\nsituation (b). During this period, a transient current flows from\nthe first capacitor to the second. Energy is lost during this time\nin the form of heat and electromagnetic radiation.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n84\n\n6. Potential energy stored in a system of charges is the work done (by an\nexternal agency) in assembling the charges at their locations. Potential\nenergy of two charges q1, q2 at r1, r2 is given by\n\n1 2\n\n0 12\n\n1\n4\n\nq q\nU\n\nrε\n=\n\nπ\n\nwhere r\n12\n\n is distance between q\n1\n and q\n\n2\n.\n\n7. The potential energy of a charge q in an external potential V (r) is qV (r).\nThe potential energy of a dipole moment p in a uniform electric field E  is\n–p.E.\n\n 8. Electrostatics field E is zero in the interior of a conductor; just outside\nthe surface of a charged conductor, E is normal to the surface given by\n\n0\n\nˆ\nσ\nε\n\n=E n  where n̂  is the unit vector along the outward normal to the\n\nsurface and σ is the surface charge density. Charges in a conductor can\nreside only at its surface. Potential is constant within and on the surface\nof a conductor. In a cavity within a conductor (with no charges), the\nelectric field is zero.\n\n9.  A capacitor is a system of two conductors separated by an insulator. Its\ncapacitance is defined by C = Q/V, where Q and –Q are the charges on the\ntwo conductors and V is the potential difference between them. C is\ndetermined purely geometrically, by the shapes, sizes and relative\npositions of the two conductors. The unit of capacitance is farad:,\n1 F = 1 C V –1. For a parallel plate capacitor (with vacuum between the\nplates),\n\nC = 0\nA\n\nd\nε\n\nwhere A is the area of each plate and d the separation between them.\n\n10. If the medium between the plates of a capacitor is filled with an insulating\nsubstance (dielectric), the electric field due to the charged plates induces\na net dipole moment in the dielectric. This effect, called polarisation,\ngives rise to a field in the opposite direction. The net electric field inside\nthe dielectric and hence the potential difference between the plates is\nthus reduced. Consequently, the capacitance C increases from its value\nC0 when there is no medium (vacuum),\n\nC = KC0\n\nwhere K is the dielectric constant of the insulating substance.\n\n11. For capacitors in the series combination, the total capacitance C is given by\n\n1 2 3\n\n1 1 1 1\n...\n\nC C C C\n= + + +\n\nIn the parallel combination, the total capacitance C is:\n\nC =  C1 + C2 + C3 + ...\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectrostatic Potential\n\nand Capacitance\n\n85\n\nPhysical quantity Symbol Dimensions Unit  Remark\n\nPotential  or V [M1 L2 T–3 A–1] V Potential difference is\nphysically significant\n\nCapacitance C [M–1 L–2 T–4 A2] F\n\nPolarisation P [L–2 AT] C m-2 Dipole moment per unit\nvolume\n\nDielectric constant K [Dimensionless]\n\nwhere C1, C2, C3... are individual capacitances.\n\n12.

Electrostatics deals with forces between charges at rest. But if there is a\nforce on a charge, how can it be at rest? Thus, when we are talking of\nelectrostatic force between charges, it should be understood that each\ncharge is being kept at rest by some unspecified force that opposes the\nnet Coulomb force on the charge.\n\n2. A capacitor is so configured that it confines the electric field lines within\na small region of space. Thus, even though field may have considerable\nstrength, the potential difference between the two conductors of a\ncapacitor is small.\n\n3. Electric field is discontinuous across the surface of a spherical charged\nshell. It is zero inside and \n\nσ\nε0\n\nn̂ outside. Electric potential is, however\ncontinuous across the surface, equal to q/4πε\n\n0\nR  at the surface.\n\n4. The torque p × E on a dipole causes it to oscillate about E. Only if there\nis a dissipative mechanism, the oscillations are damped and the dipole\neventually aligns with E.\n\n5. Potential due to a charge q at its own location is not defined – it is\ninfinite.\n\n6. In the expression qV (r) for potential energy of a charge q, V (r) is the\npotential due to external charges and not the potential due to q. As seen\nin point 5, this expression will be ill-defined if V (r) includes potential\ndue to a charge q itself.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n86\n\nEXERCISES\n\n2.1 Two charges 5 × 10–8 C and –3 × 10–8 C are located 16 cm apart.

Charges in motion constitute an electric current. Such currents occur\n\nnaturally in many situations. Lightning is one such phenomenon in\n\nwhich charges flow from the clouds to the earth through the atmosphere,\n\nsometimes with disastrous results. The flow of charges in lightning is not\n\nsteady, but in our everyday life we see many devices where charges flow\n\nin a steady manner, like water flowing smoothly in a river. A torch and a\n\ncell-driven clock are examples of such devices. In the present chapter, we\n\nshall study some of the basic laws concerning steady electric currents.\n\n3.2  ELECTRIC CURRENT\nImagine a small area held normal to the direction of flow of charges. Both\n\nthe positive and the negative charges may flow forward and backward\n\nacross the area. In a given time interval t, let q\n+\n be the net amount (i.e.,\n\nforward minus backward) of positive charge that flows in the forward\n\ndirection across the area. Similarly, let q\n–\n be the net amount of negative\n\ncharge flowing across the area in the forward direction. The net amount\n\nof charge flowing across the area in the forward direction in the time\n\ninterval t, then, is q = q\n+\n– q\n\n–\n. This is proportional to t for steady current\n\nChapter Three\n\nCURRENT\n\nELECTRICITY\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n94\n\nand the quotient\n\nq\nI\n\nt\n= (3.1)\n\nis defined to be the current across the area in the forward direction. (If it\nturn out to be a negative number, it implies a current in the backward\ndirection.)\n\nCurrents are not always steady and hence more generally, we define\nthe current as follows. Let ∆Q be the net charge flowing across a cross-\nsection of a conductor during the time interval ∆t [i.e., between times t\nand (t + ∆t)]. Then, the current at time t across the cross-section of the\nconductor is defined as the value of the ratio of ∆Q to ∆t in the limit of ∆t\ntending to zero,\n\n( )\n0\n\nlim\nt\n\nQ\nI t\n\nt∆ →\n\n∆\n≡\n\n∆\n(3.2)\n\nIn SI units, the unit of current is ampere. An ampere is defined\nthrough magnetic effects of currents that we will study in the following\nchapter. An ampere is typically the order of magnitude of currents in\n\ndomestic appliances. An average lightning carries currents of the order\nof tens of thousands of amperes and at the other extreme, currents in\nour nerves are in microamperes.\n\n3.3 ELECTRIC CURRENTS IN CONDUCTORS\nAn electric charge will experience a force if an electric field is applied. If it is\nfree to move, it will thus move contributing to a current. In nature, free\n\ncharged particles do exist like in upper strata of atmosphere called the\nionosphere. However, in atoms and molecules, the negatively charged\nelectrons and the positively charged nuclei are bound to each other and\n\nare thus not free to move. Bulk matter is made up of many molecules, a\ngram of water, for example, contains approximately 10\n\n22\n molecules. These\n\nmolecules are so closely packed that the electrons are no longer attached\n\nto individual nuclei. In some materials, the electrons will still be bound,\ni.e., they will not accelerate even if an electric field is applied. In other\nmaterials, notably metals, some of the electrons are practically free to move\n\nwithin the bulk material. These materials, generally called conductors,\ndevelop electric currents in them when an electric field is applied.\n\nIf we consider solid conductors, then of course the atoms are tightly\nbound to each other so that the current is carried by the negatively\ncharged electrons. There are, however, other types of conductors like\nelectrolytic solutions where positive and negative charges both can move.\nIn our discussions, we will focus only on solid conductors so that the\ncurrent is carried by the negatively charged electrons in the background\nof fixed positive ions.\n\nConsider first the case when no electric field is present. The electrons\nwill be moving due to thermal motion during which they collide with the\nfixed ions. An electron colliding with an ion emerges with the same speed\n\nas before the collision. However, the direction of its velocity after the\ncollision is completely random. At a given time, there is no preferential\ndirection for the velocities of the electrons. Thus on the average, the\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nCurrent\n\nElectricity\n\n95\n\nnumber of electrons travelling in any direction will be equal to the number\nof electrons travelling in the opposite direction. So, there will be no net\n\nelectric current.\nLet us now see what happens to such a\n\npiece of conductor if an electric field is applied.\n\nTo focus our thoughts, imagine the conductor\nin the shape of a cylinder of radius R (Fig. 3.1).\nSuppose we now take two thin circular discs\n\nof a dielectric of the same radius and put\npositive charge +Q distributed over one disc\nand similarly –Q at the other disc. We attach\n\nthe two discs on the two flat surfaces of the\ncylinder. An electric field will be created and\nis directed from the positive towards the\n\nnegative charge. The electrons will be accelerated due to this field towards\n+Q. They will thus move to neutralise the charges. The electrons, as long\nas they are moving, will constitute an electric current. Hence in the\n\nsituation considered, there will be a current for a very short while and no\ncurrent thereafter.\n\nWe can also imagine a mechanism where the ends of the cylinder are\n\nsupplied with fresh charges to make up for any charges neutralised by\nelectrons moving inside the conductor. In that case, there will be a steady\nelectric field in the body of the conductor. This will result in a continuous\n\ncurrent rather than a current for a short period of time. Mechanisms,\nwhich maintain a steady electric field are cells or batteries that we shall\nstudy  later in this chapter. In the next sections, we shall study the steady\n\ncurrent that results from a steady electric field in conductors.\n\n3.4  OHM’S LAW\nA basic law regarding flow of currents was discovered by G.S. Ohm in\n\n1828, long before the physical mechanism responsible for flow of currents\nwas discovered. Imagine a conductor through which a current I is flowing\nand let V be the potential difference between the ends of the conductor.\n\nThen Ohm’s law states that\n\n     V ∝ I\n\nor, V = R I (3.3)\n\nwhere the constant of proportionality R is called the resistance of the\n\nconductor. The SI units of resistance is ohm, and is denoted by the symbol\n\nΩ. The resistance R not only depends on the material of the conductor\nbut also on the dimensions of the conductor. The dependence of R on the\n\ndimensions of the conductor can easily be determined as follows.\n\nConsider a conductor satisfying Eq. (3.3) to be in the form of a slab of\nlength l and cross sectional area A [Fig. 3.2(a)]. Imagine placing two such\nidentical slabs side by side [Fig. 3.2(b)], so that the length of the\n\ncombination is 2l. The current flowing through the  combination is the\nsame as that flowing through either of the slabs. If V is the potential\ndifference across the ends of the first slab, then V is also the potential\n\ndifference across the ends of the second slab since the second slab is\n\nFIGURE 3.1 Charges +Q and –Q put at the ends\nof a metallic cylinder. The electrons will drift\n\nbecause of the electric field created to\n\nneutralise the charges. The current thus\nwill stop after a while unless the charges +Q\n\nand –Q are continuously replenished.\n\nFIGURE 3.2\nIllustrating the\n\nrelation R = ρl/A for\na rectangular slab\nof length l and area\n\nof cross-section A.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n96\n\nidentical to the first and the same current I flows through\nboth. The potential difference across the ends of the\n\ncombination is clearly sum of the potential difference\nacross the two individual slabs and hence equals 2V. The\ncurrent through the combination is I and the resistance\n\nof the combination R\nC\n is [from Eq. (3.3)],\n\n2\n2C\n\nV\nR R\n\nI\n= = (3.4)\n\nsince V/I = R, the resistance of either of the slabs. Thus,\n\ndoubling the length of a conductor doubles the\nresistance. In general, then resistance is proportional to\nlength,\n\nR l∝ (3.5)\nNext, imagine dividing the slab into two by cutting it\n\nlengthwise so that the slab can be considered as a\n\ncombination of two identical slabs of length l , but each\nhaving a cross sectional  area of A/2 [Fig. 3.2(c)].\n\nFor a given voltage V across the slab, if I is the current\n\nthrough the entire slab, then clearly the current flowing\nthrough each of the two half-slabs is I/2. Since the\npotential difference across the ends of the half-slabs is V,\n\ni.e., the same as across the full slab, the resistance of each\nof the half-slabs R\n\n1\n is\n\n1 2 2 .\n( /2)\n\nV V\nR R\n\nI I\n= = = (3.6)\n\nThus, halving the area of the cross-section of a conductor doubles\nthe resistance. In general, then the resistance R is inversely proportional\nto the cross-sectional area,\n\n1\nR\n\nA\n∝ (3.7)\n\nCombining Eqs. (3.5) and (3.7), we have\n\nl\nR\n\nA\n∝ (3.8)\n\nand hence for a given conductor\n\nl\nR\n\nA\nρ= (3.9)\n\nwhere the constant of proportionality ρ depends on the material of the\nconductor but not on its dimensions. ρ is called resistivity.\n\nUsing the last equation, Ohm’s law reads\n\nI l\nV I R\n\nA\n\nρ\n= × = (3.10)\n\nCurrent per unit area (taken normal to the current), I/A, is called\ncurrent density and is denoted by j. The SI units of the current density\n\nare A/m\n2\n. Further, if E is the magnitude of uniform electric field in the\n\nconductor whose length is l, then the potential difference V across its\nends is El. Using these, the last equation reads\n\nG\nE\n\nO\nR\n\nG\n S\n\nIM\nO\n\nN\n O\n\nH\nM\n\n (\n1\n7\n8\n7\n–\n1\n\n8\n5\n4\n)\n\nGeorg Simon Ohm  (1787–\n\n1854) German physicist,\nprofessor at Munich. Ohm\nwas led to his law by an\n\nanalogy between the\nconduction of heat: the\nelectric field is analogous to\n\nthe temperature gradient,\nand the electric current is\nanalogous to the heat flow.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nCurrent\n\nElectricity\n\n97\n\n        E l = j ρ l\n\nor,    E = j ρ (3.11)\nThe above relation for magnitudes E and j can indeed be cast in a\n\nvector  form. The current density, (which we have defined as the current\nthrough unit area normal to the current) is also directed along E, and is\n\nalso a vector j (≡≡≡≡≡ j E/E). Thus, the last equation can be written as,\n        E = jρ (3.12)\n\nor,   j = σ E (3.13)\nwhere σ ≡1/ρ is called the conductivity. Ohm’s law is often stated in an\nequivalent form, Eq. (3.13) in addition to Eq.(3.3). In the next section, we\nwill try to understand the origin of the Ohm’s law as arising from the\n\ncharacteristics of the drift of electrons.\n\n3.5 DRIFT OF ELECTRONS AND THE ORIGIN\nOF RESISTIVITY\n\nAs remarked before, an electron will suffer collisions with the heavy fixed\nions, but after collision, it will emerge with the same speed but in random\ndirections. If we consider all the electrons, their average velocity will be\n\nzero since their directions are random. Thus, if there are N electrons and\nthe velocity of the i\n\nth\n electron (i = 1, 2, 3, ... N ) at a given time is v\n\ni\n, then\n\n1\n0\n\n1N\ni\n\ni\n\nv =\n=\n∑\nN\n\n(3.14)\n\nConsider now the situation when an electric field is\n\npresent. Electrons will be accelerated due to this\nfield by\n\n=\n– E\n\na\ne\n\nm\n(3.15)\n\nwhere –e is the charge and m is the mass of an electron.\nConsider again the i\n\nth\n electron at a given time t. This\n\nelectron would have had its last collision some time\n\nbefore t, and let t\ni\n be the time elapsed after its last\n\ncollision. If v\ni\n was its velocity immediately after the last\n\ncollision, then its velocity V\ni\n at time t is\n\n−  = +     \nE\n\nV v\ni i i\n\ne\nt\n\nm\n(3.16)\n\nsince starting with its last collision it was accelerated\n(Fig. 3.3) with an acceleration given by Eq. (3.15) for a\ntime interval t\n\ni\n. The average velocity of the electrons at\n\ntime t is the average of all the V\ni\n’s. The average of v\n\ni\n’s is\n\nzero [Eq. (3.14)] since immediately after any collision,\nthe direction of the velocity of an electron is completely\n\nrandom. The collisions of the electrons do not occur at\nregular intervals but at random times. Let us denote by\nτ, the average time between successive collisions. Then\nat a given time, some of the electrons would have spent\n\nFIGURE 3.3 A schematic picture of\n\nan electron moving from a point A to\nanother point B through repeated\ncollisions, and straight line travel\n\nbetween collisions (full lines). If an\nelectric field is applied as shown, the\nelectron ends up at point B′ (dotted\nlines). A slight drift in a direction\n\nopposite the electric field is visible.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n98\n\ntime more than τ and some less than τ. In other words, the time t\ni\n in\n\nEq. (3.16) will be less than τ for some and more than τ for others as we go\nthrough the values of i = 1, 2 ..... N. The average value of t\n\ni\n then is τ\n\n(known as relaxation time). Thus, averaging Eq. (3.16) over the\nN-electrons at any given time t gives us for the average velocity v\n\nd\n\n( ) ( ) ( )≡ = − Ev V vd i i iaverage average average\ne\n\nt\nm\n\n0 – τ τ= = −\nE Ee e\n\nm m\n(3.17)\n\nThis last result is surprising. It tells us that the\n\nelectrons move with an average velocity which is\nindependent of time, although electrons are\naccelerated. This is the phenomenon of drift and the\n\nvelocity v\nd\n in Eq. (3.17) is called the drift velocity.\n\nBecause of the drift, there will be net transport of\ncharges across any area perpendicular to E. Consider\n\na planar area A, located inside the conductor such that\nthe normal to the area is parallel to E (Fig. 3.4). Then\nbecause of the drift, in an infinitesimal amount of time\n\n∆t, all electrons to the left of the area at distances upto\n|v\n\nd\n|∆t would have crossed the area. If n is the number\n\nof free electrons per unit volume in the metal, then\n\nthere are n ∆t |v\nd\n|A such electrons. Since each\n\nelectron carries a charge –e, the total charge transported across this area\nA to the right in time ∆t is –ne A|v\n\nd\n|∆t. E is directed towards the left and\n\nhence the total charge transported along E across the area is negative of\nthis. The amount of charge crossing the area A in time ∆t is by definition\n[Eq. (3.2)] I ∆t, where I is the magnitude of the current. Hence,\n\nv∆ = + ∆dI t n e A t (3.18)\n\nSubstituting the value of |v\nd\n| from Eq. (3.17)\n\n2\n\nEτ∆ = ∆\ne A\n\nI t n t\nm\n\n(3.19)\n\nBy definition I is related to the magnitude |j| of the current density by\n\nI = |j|A (3.20)\n\nHence, from Eqs.(3.19) and (3.20),\n\n2\n\nj Eτ=\nne\n\nm\n(3.21)\n\nThe vector j is parallel to E and hence we can write Eq. (3.21) in the\n\nvector form\n\n2\n\nτ=j E\nne\n\nm\n(3.22)\n\nComparison with Eq. (3.13) shows that Eq. (3.22) is exactly the Ohm’s\nlaw, if we identify the conductivity σ  as\n\nFIGURE 3.4 Current in a metallic\n\nconductor. The magnitude of current\ndensity in a metal is the magnitude of\ncharge contained in a cylinder of unit\n\narea and length v\nd\n.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nCurrent\n\nElectricity\n\n99\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 3\n\n.1\n\n2\nne\n\nm\nσ τ= (3.23)\n\nWe thus see that a very simple picture of electrical conduction\nreproduces Ohm’s law. We have, of course, made assumptions that τ\nand n are constants, independent of E. We shall, in the next section,\ndiscuss the limitations of Ohm’s law.\n\nExample 3.1 (a) Estimate the average drift speed of conduction\nelectrons in a copper wire of cross-sectional area 1.0 × 10\n\n–7\n m\n\n2 \ncarrying\n\na current of 1.5 A. Assume that each copper atom contributes roughly\n\none conduction electron. The density of copper is 9.0 × 10\n3 \n\nkg/m\n3\n,\n\nand its atomic mass is 63.5 u. (b) Compare the drift speed obtained\nabove with, (i) thermal speeds of copper atoms at ordinary\n\ntemperatures, (ii) speed of propagation of electric field along the\nconductor which causes the drift motion.\n\nSolution\n\n(a) The direction of drift velocity of conduction electrons is opposite\nto the electric field direction, i.e., electrons drift in the direction\nof increasing potential. The drift speed v\n\nd\n is given by Eq. (3.18)\n\nv\nd\n  = (I/neA)\n\nNow, e = 1.6 × 10\n–19\n\n C, A = 1.0 × 10\n–7\n\nm\n2\n, I = 1.5 A. The density of\n\nconduction electrons, n is equal to the number of atoms per cubic\n\nmetre (assuming one conduction electron per Cu atom as is\nreasonable from its valence electron count of one). A cubic metre\nof copper has a mass of 9.0 × 103 kg. Since 6.0 × 1023 copper\n\natoms have a mass of 63.5 g,\n\n23\n66.0 10\n\n9.0 10\n63.5\n\nn\n×\n\n= × ×\n\n   = 8.5 × 10\n28\n\n m\n–3\n\nwhich gives,\n\n28 –19 –7\n\n1.5\n\n8.5 10 1.6 10 1.0 10\n=\n\n× × × × ×d\nv\n\n    = 1.1 × 10–3 m s–1  = 1.1 mm s–1\n\n(b) (i) At a temperature T, the thermal speed* of a copper atom of\n\nmass M is obtained from [<(1/2) Mv\n2\n > = (3/2) k\n\nB\nT ] and is thus\n\ntypically of the order of /Bk T M , where kB is the Boltzmann\n\nconstant. For copper at 300 K, this is about 2 × 10\n2\n m/s. This\n\nfigure indicates the random vibrational speeds of copper atoms\nin a conductor. Note that the drift speed of electrons is much\n\nsmaller, about 10\n–5\n\n times the typical thermal speed at ordinary\ntemperatures.\n(ii) An electric field travelling along the conductor has a speed of\n\nan electromagnetic wave, namely equal to 3.0 × 10\n8\n m s\n\n–1\n\n(You will learn about this in Chapter 8). The drift speed is, in\n\ncomparison, extremely small; smaller by a factor of 10\n–11\n\n.\n\n* See Eq. (13.23) of Chapter 13 from Class XI book.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n100\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 3\n\n.2\n\nExample 3.2\n\n(a) In Example 3.1, the electron drift speed is estimated to be only a\nfew mm s\n\n–1\n for currents in the range of a few amperes? How then\n\nis current established almost the instant a circuit is closed?\n\n(b) The electron drift arises due to the force experienced by electrons\nin the electric field inside the conductor. But force should cause\nacceleration. Why then do the electrons acquire a steady average\n\ndrift speed?\n(c) If the electron drift speed is so small, and the electron’s charge is\n\nsmall, how can we still obtain large amounts of current in a\n\nconductor?\n(d) When electrons drift in a metal from lower to higher potential,\n\ndoes it mean that all the ‘free’ electrons of the metal are moving\n\nin the same direction?\n(e) Are the paths of electrons straight lines between successive\n\ncollisions (with the positive ions of the metal) in the (i) absence of\n\nelectric field, (ii) presence of electric field?\n\nSolution\n(a) Electric field is established throughout the circuit, almost instantly\n\n(with the speed of light) causing at every point a local electron\ndrift. Establishment of a current does not have to wait for electrons\nfrom one end of the conductor travelling to the other end. However,\n\nit does take a little while for the current to reach its steady value.\n(b) Each ‘free’ electron does accelerate, increasing its drift speed until\n\nit collides with a positive ion of the metal. It loses its drift speed\n\nafter collision but starts to accelerate and increases its drift speed\nagain only to suffer a collision again and so on. On the average,\ntherefore, electrons acquire only a drift speed.\n\n(c) Simple, because the electron number density is enormous,\n~10\n\n29\n m\n\n–3\n.\n\n(d) By no means. The drift velocity is superposed over the large\n\nrandom velocities of electrons.\n(e) In the absence of electric field, the paths are straight lines; in the\n\npresence of electric field, the paths are, in general, curved.\n\n3.5.1  Mobility\n\nAs we have seen, conductivity arises from mobile charge carriers. In\n\nmetals, these mobile charge carriers are electrons; in an ionised gas, they\nare electrons and positive charged ions; in an electrolyte, these can be\nboth positive and negative ions.\n\nAn important quantity is the mobility µ defined as the magnitude of\nthe drift velocity per unit electric field:\n\n| |d\n\nE\nµ =\n\nv\n(3.24)\n\nThe SI unit of mobility is m2/Vs and is 104 of the mobility in practical\n\nunits (cm\n2\n/Vs). Mobility is positive. From Eq. (3.17), we have\n\nv\nd\n = \n\nτe E\nm\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nCurrent\n\nElectricity\n\n101\n\nHence,\n\nτ\nµ = =d\n\nv e\n\nE m\n(3.25)\n\nwhere τ is the average collision time for electrons.\n\n3.6  LIMITATIONS OF OHM’S LAW\nAlthough Ohm’s law has been found valid over a large class\n\nof materials, there do exist materials and devices used in\nelectric circuits where the proportionality of V and I does not\nhold. The deviations broadly are one or more of the following\n\ntypes:\n(a) V ceases to be proportional to I (Fig. 3.5).\n(b) The relation between V and I depends on the sign of V. In\n\nother words, if I is the current for a certain V, then reversing\nthe direction of V keeping its magnitude fixed, does not\nproduce a current of the same magnitude as I in the opposite direction\n\n(Fig. 3.6). This happens, for example, in a diode which we will study\nin Chapter 14.\n\n(c) The relation between V and I is not unique, i.e., there is more than\n\none value of V for the same current I (Fig. 3.7). A material exhibiting\nsuch behaviour is GaAs.\nMaterials and devices not obeying Ohm’s law in the form of Eq. (3.3)\n\nare actually widely used in electronic circuits. In this and a few\nsubsequent chapters, however, we will study the electrical currents in\nmaterials that obey Ohm’s law.\n\n3.7  RESISTIVITY OF VARIOUS MATERIALS\nThe resistivities of various common materials are listed in Table 3.1. The\nmaterials are classified as conductors, semiconductors and insulators\n\nFIGURE 3.5 The dashed line\nrepresents the linear Ohm’s\n\nlaw. The solid line is the voltage\n\nV versus current I for a good\nconductor.\n\nFIGURE 3.6 Characteristic curve\nof a diode. Note the different\n\nscales for negative and positive\n\nvalues of the voltage and current.\n\nFIGURE 3.7 Variation of current\n\nversus voltage for GaAs.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n102\n\ndepending on their resistivities, in an increasing order of their values.\n\nMetals have low resistivities in the range of 10\n–8\n\n Ωm to 10–6 Ωm. At the\nother end are insulators like ceramic, rubber and plastics having\n\nresistivities 10\n18\n\n times greater than metals or more. In between the two\n\nare the semiconductors. These, however, have resistivities\n\ncharacteristically decreasing with a rise in temperature. The resistivities\n\nof semiconductors can be decreased by adding small amount of suitable\n\nimpurities. This last feature is exploited in use of semiconductors for\n\nelectronic devices.\n\nTABLE 3.1 RESISTIVITIES OF SOME MATERIALS\n\nMaterial Resistivity, ρ Temperature coefficient\n(Ω m) at 0°C of resistivity, α (°C) –1\n\n1 d\n   at  0 C\n\nd\n\nρ\nρ\n\n  °    T\n\nConductors\n\nSilver 1.6 × 10\n–8\n\n0.0041\nCopper 1.7 × 10\n\n–8\n0.0068\n\nAluminium 2.7 × 10–8 0.0043\n\nTungsten 5.6 × 10\n–8\n\n0.0045\nIron 10 × 10\n\n–8\n0.0065\n\nPlatinum 11 × 10\n–8\n\n0.0039\n\nMercury 98 × 10\n–8\n\n0.0009\nNichrome ~100 × 10\n\n–8\n0.0004\n\n(alloy of Ni, Fe, Cr)\n\nManganin (alloy) 48 × 10\n–8\n\n0.002 × 10\n–3\n\nSemiconductors\n\nCarbon (graphite) 3.5 × 10\n–5\n\n– 0.0005\nGermanium 0.46 – 0.05\nSilicon 2300 – 0.07\n\nInsulators\n\nPure Water 2.5 × 10\n5\n\nGlass 10\n10\n\n – 10\n14\n\nHard Rubber 10\n13\n\n – 10\n16\n\nNaCl ~10\n14\n\nFused Quartz ~10\n16\n\nCommercially produced resistors for domestic use or in laboratories\n\nare of two major types: wire bound resistors and carbon resistors.

The choice of these materials is\n\ndictated mostly by the fact that their resistivities are relatively insensitive\n\nto temperature. These resistances are typically in the range of a fraction\n\nof an ohm to a few hundred ohms.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nCurrent\n\nElectricity\n\n103\n\nResistors in the higher range are made mostly from carbon.

The last band stands for tolerance or possible\n\nvariation in percentage about the indicated values.\n\nSometimes, this last band is absent and that indicates\na tolerance of 20% (Fig. 3.8). For example, if the four\n\ncolours are orange, blue, yellow and gold, the resistance\n\nvalue is 36 × 10\n4\n Ω, with a tolerence value of 5%.\n\n3.8 TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE OF\nRESISTIVITY\n\nThe resistivity of a material is found to be dependent on\nthe temperature. Different materials do not exhibit the\n\nsame dependence on temperatures. Over a limited range\nof temperatures, that is not too large, the resistivity of a\nmetallic conductor is approximately given by,\n\nρ\nT\n = ρ\n\n0\n [1 + α (T–T\n\n0\n)] (3.26)\n\nwhere ρ\nT\n is the resistivity at a temperature T and ρ\n\n0\n is the same at a\n\nreference temperature T\n0\n. α is called the temperature co-efficient of\n\nresistivity, and from Eq. (3.26), the dimension of α is (Temperature)–1.\n\nFIGURE 3.8 Colour coded resistors\n(a) (22 × 10\n\n2\n Ω) ± 10%,\n\n(b) (47 × 10 Ω) ± 5%.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n104\n\nFor  metals, α is positive and values of α for some metals at  T\n0\n = 0°C are\n\nlisted in Table 3.1.\n\nThe relation of Eq. (3.26) implies that a graph of ρ\nT\n plotted against T\n\nwould be a straight line. At temperatures much lower than 0°C, the graph,\n\nhowever, deviates considerably from a straight line (Fig. 3.9).\n\nEquation (3.26) thus, can be used approximately over a limited range\nof T around any reference temperature T\n\n0\n, where the graph can be\n\napproximated as a straight line.\n\nSome materials like Nichrome (which is an alloy of nickel, iron and\n\nchromium) exhibit a very weak dependence of resistivity with temperature\n\n(Fig. 3.10). Manganin and constantan have similar properties. These\n\nmaterials are thus widely used in wire bound standard resistors since\n\ntheir resistance values would change very little with temperatures.\n\nUnlike metals, the resistivities of semiconductors decrease with\n\nincreasing temperatures. A typical dependence is shown in Fig. 3.11.\n\nWe can qualitatively understand the temperature dependence of\n\nresistivity, in the light of our derivation of Eq. (3.23). From this equation,\n\nresistivity of a material is given by\n\n2\n\n1 m\n\nn e\nρ\n\nσ τ\n= = (3.27)\n\nρ thus depends inversely both on the number n of free electrons per unit\nvolume and on the average time τ between collisions. As we increase\ntemperature, average speed of the electrons, which act as the carriers of\n\ncurrent, increases resulting in more frequent collisions. The average time\n\nof collisions τ, thus decreases with temperature.\nIn a metal, n is not dependent on temperature to any appreciable\n\nextent and thus the decrease in the value of τ with rise in temperature\ncauses ρ to increase as we have observed.\n\nFor insulators and semiconductors, however, n increases with\n\ntemperature. This increase more than compensates any decrease in τ in\nEq.(3.23) so that for such materials, ρ decreases with temperature.\n\nFIGURE 3.9\nResistivity ρ\n\nT\n of\n\ncopper as a function\n\nof temperature T.\n\nFIGURE 3.10 Resistivity\nρ\n\nT\n of nichrome as a\n\nfunction of absolute\n\ntemperature T.\n\nFIGURE 3.11\n\nTemperature dependence\nof resistivity for a typical\n\nsemiconductor.\n\nρ\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nCurrent\n\nElectricity\n\n105\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 3\n\n.4\n\nExample 3.3 An electric toaster uses nichrome for its heating\nelement. When a negligibly small current passes through it, its\n\nresistance at room temperature (27.0 °C) is found to be 75.3 Ω. When\nthe toaster is connected to a 230 V supply, the current settles, after\na few seconds, to a steady value of 2.68 A. What is the steady\n\ntemperature of the nichrome element? The temperature coefficient\nof resistance of nichrome averaged over the temperature range\ninvolved, is 1.70 × 10–4 °C–1.\n\nSolution  When the current through the element is very small, heating\neffects can be ignored and the temperature T\n\n1\n of the element is the\n\nsame as room temperature. When the toaster is connected to the\n\nsupply, its initial current will be slightly higher than its steady value\nof 2.68 A. But due to heating effect of the current, the temperature\nwill rise. This will cause an increase in resistance and a slight\n\ndecrease in current. In a few seconds, a steady state will be reached\nwhen temperature will rise no further, and both the resistance of the\nelement and the current drawn will achieve steady values.

The electric potential at A and B are denoted by V (A)\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 3\n\n.3\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n106\n\nand V (B) respectively. Since current is flowing from A to B, V (A) > V (B)\nand the potential difference across  AB is V = V(A) – V(B) > 0.\n\nIn a time interval ∆t, an amount of charge ∆Q = I ∆t travels from A to\nB. The potential energy of the charge at A, by definition, was Q V (A) and\nsimilarly at B, it is Q V(B). Thus, change in its potential energy ∆U\n\npot\n is\n\n∆U\npot\n\n = Final potential energy – Initial potential energy\n         = ∆Q[(V (B) – V (A)] = –∆Q V\n         = –I V∆t < 0 (3.28)\nIf charges moved without collisions through the conductor, their\n\nkinetic energy would also change so that the total energy is unchanged.\nConservation of total energy would then imply that,\n\n∆K =  –∆U\npot\n\n(3.29)\n\nthat is,\n\n∆K = I V∆t > 0 (3.30)\nThus, in case charges were moving freely through the conductor under\n\nthe action of electric field, their kinetic energy would increase as they\nmove. We have, however, seen earlier that on the average, charge carriers\n\ndo not move with acceleration but with a steady drift velocity. This is\nbecause of the collisions with ions and atoms during transit. During\ncollisions, the energy gained by the charges thus is shared with the atoms.\n\nThe atoms vibrate more vigorously, i.e., the conductor heats up. Thus,\nin an actual conductor, an amount of energy dissipated as heat in the\nconductor during the time interval ∆t is,\n\n∆W = I V∆t (3.31)\nThe energy dissipated per unit time is the power dissipated\n\nP = ∆W/∆t  and we have,\nP = I V (3.32)\n\nUsing Ohm’s law V = IR, we get\n\nP = I \n2\n R = V \n\n2\n/R (3.33)\n\nas the power loss (“ohmic loss”) in a conductor of resistance R carrying a\ncurrent I. It is this power which heats up, for example, the coil of an\n\nelectric bulb to incandescence, radiating out heat and\n\nlight.\nWhere does the power come from? As we have\n\nreasoned before, we need an external source to keep\n\na steady current through the conductor. It is clearly\nthis source which must supply this power. In the\nsimple circuit shown with a cell (Fig.3.12), it is the\n\nchemical energy of the cell which supplies this power\nfor as long as it can.\n\nThe expressions for power, Eqs. (3.32) and (3.33),\n\nshow the dependence of the power dissipated in a\nresistor R on the current through it and the voltage\nacross it.\n\nEquation (3.33) has an important application to\npower transmission. Electrical power is transmitted\nfrom power stations to homes and factories, which\n\nFIGURE 3.12 Heat is produced in the\nresistor R which is connected across\n\nthe terminals of a cell. The energy\n\ndissipated in the resistor R comes from\nthe chemical energy of the electrolyte.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nCurrent\n\nElectricity\n\n107\n\nmay be hundreds of miles away, via transmission cables. One obviously\nwants to minimise the power loss in the transmission cables connecting\n\nthe power stations to homes and factories. We shall  see now how this\ncan be achieved. Consider a device R, to which a power P is to be delivered\nvia transmission cables having a resistance R\n\nc\n to be dissipated by it finally.\n\nIf V is the voltage across R and I the current through it, then\nP = V I (3.34)\nThe connecting wires from the power station to the device has a finite\n\nresistance R\nc\n. The power dissipated in the connecting wires, which is\n\nwasted is P\nc\n  with\n\nP\nc\n = I\n\n2\n R\n\nc\n\n   \n2\n\n2\n\ncP R\n\nV\n= (3.35)\n\nfrom Eq. (3.32). Thus, to drive a device of power P, the power wasted in the\n\nconnecting wires is inversely proportional to V \n2\n. The  transmission cables\n\nfrom power stations are hundreds of miles long and their resistance R\nc\n is\n\nconsiderable. To reduce P\nc\n, these wires carry current at enormous values\n\nof V and this is the reason for the high voltage danger signs on transmission\nlines — a common sight as we move away from populated areas. Using\nelectricity at such voltages is not safe and hence at the other end, a device\n\ncalled a transformer lowers the voltage to a value suitable for use.\n\n3.10 COMBINATION OF RESISTORS – SERIES AND\nPARALLEL\n\nThe current through a single resistor R across which there is a potential\n\ndifference V is given by Ohm’s law I = V/R. Resistors are sometimes joined\ntogether and there are simple rules for calculation of equivalent resistance\nof such combination.\n\nFIGURE 3.13 A series combination of two resistors R\n1\n and R\n\n2\n.\n\nTwo resistors are said to be in series if only one of their end points is\njoined (Fig. 3.13). If a third resistor is joined with the series combination\nof the two (Fig. 3.14), then all three are said to be in series. Clearly, we\n\ncan extend this definition to series combination of any number of resistors.\n\nFIGURE 3.14 A series combination of three resistors R\n1\n, R\n\n2\n, R\n\n3\n.\n\nTwo or more resistors are said to be in parallel if one end of all the\nresistors is joined together and similarly the other ends joined together\n\n(Fig. 3.15).\n\nFIGURE 3.15 Two resistors R\n1\n and R\n\n2\n connected in parallel.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n108\n\nConsider two resistors R\n1\n and R\n\n2\n in series. The charge which leaves R\n\n1\n\nmust be entering R\n2\n. Since current measures the rate of flow of charge,\n\nthis means that the same current I flows through R\n1\n and R\n\n2\n. By Ohm’s law:\n\nPotential difference across R\n1\n = V\n\n1\n = I R\n\n1\n, and\n\nPotential difference across R\n2\n = V\n\n2\n = I R\n\n2\n.\n\nThe potential difference V across the combination is V\n1\n+V\n\n2\n. Hence,\n\nV = V\n1\n+ V\n\n2\n = I (R\n\n1\n + R\n\n2\n) (3.36)\n\nThis is as if the combination had an equivalent resistance R\neq\n\n, which\n\nby Ohm’s law is\n\nR\neq\n\n \nV\n\nI\n≡  = (R\n\n1\n + R\n\n2\n) (3.37)\n\nIf we had three resistors connected in series, then similarly\n\nV = I R\n1\n + I R\n\n2\n + I R\n\n3\n = I (R\n\n1\n+ R\n\n2\n+ R\n\n3\n). (3.38)\n\nThis obviously can be extended to a series combination of any number\nn of resistors R\n\n1\n, R\n\n2\n ....., R\n\nn\n. The equivalent resistance R\n\neq\n is\n\nR\neq\n\n = R\n1\n + R\n\n2\n + . . . + R\n\nn\n(3.39)\n\nConsider now the parallel combination of two resistors (Fig. 3.15).\nThe charge that flows in at A from the left flows out partly through R\n\n1\n\nand partly through R\n2\n. The currents I, I\n\n1\n, I\n\n2\n shown in the figure are the\n\nrates of flow of charge at the points indicated. Hence,\n\nI = I\n1\n + I\n\n2\n(3.40)\n\nThe potential difference between A and B is given by the Ohm’s law\napplied to R\n\n1\n\nV = I\n1\n R\n\n1\n(3.41)\n\nAlso, Ohm’s law applied to R\n2\n gives\n\nV = I\n2\n R\n\n2\n(3.42)\n\n∴ I = I\n1\n + I\n\n2\n = \n\nV\n\nR\n\nV\n\nR\nV\n\nR R1 2 1 2\n\n1 1\n+ = +\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7 (3.43)\n\nIf the combination was replaced by an equivalent resistance R\neq\n\n, we\nwould have, by Ohm’s law\n\neq\n\nV\nI\n\nR\n= (3.44)\n\nHence,\n\n1 2\n\n1 1 1\n\neqR R R\n= + (3.45)\n\nWe can easily see how this extends to three resistors in parallel\n(Fig. 3.16).\n\nFIGURE 3.16 Parallel combination of three resistors R\n1\n, R\n\n2\n and R\n\n3\n.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nCurrent\n\nElectricity\n\n109\n\nExactly as before\n\nI = I\n1\n + I\n\n2\n + I\n\n3\n(3.46)\n\nand applying Ohm’s law to R\n1\n, R\n\n2\n and R\n\n3\n we get,\n\nV = I\n1\n R\n\n1\n, V = I\n\n2\n R\n\n2\n, V = I\n\n3\n R\n\n3\n(3.47)\n\nSo that\n\nI = I\n1\n + I\n\n2\n + I\n\n3\n =V\n\nR R R\n\n1 1 1\n\n1 2 3\n\n+ +\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n(3.48)\n\nAn equivalent resistance R\neq\n\n that replaces the combination, would be\nsuch that\n\neq\n\nV\nI\n\nR\n= (3.49)\n\nand hence\n\n1 2 3\n\n1 1 1 1\n\neqR R R R\n= + + (3.50)\n\nWe can reason similarly for any number of resistors in parallel.

Basically a cell has\n\ntwo electrodes, called the positive (P) and the negative (N), as shown in\nFig. 3.18. They are immersed in an electrolytic solution. Dipped in the\n\nsolution, the electrodes exchange charges with the electrolyte. The\n\npositive electrode has a potential difference V\n+\n (V\n\n+\n > 0) between\n\nitself and the electrolyte solution immediately adjacent to it marked\nA in the figure. Similarly, the negative electrode develops a negative\n\npotential  – (V\n–\n ) (V\n\n–\n ≥  0) relative to the electrolyte adjacent to it,\n\nmarked as B in the figure. When there is no current, the electrolyte\nhas the same potential throughout, so that the potential difference\nbetween P and N is V\n\n+\n – (–V\n\n–\n) = V\n\n+\n + V\n\n–\n . This difference is called the\n\nelectromotive force (emf) of the cell and is denoted by ε. Thus\nε = V\n\n+\n+V\n\n–\n > \n\n \n0 (3.55)\n\nNote that ε is, actually, a potential difference and not a force. The\nname emf, however, is used because of historical reasons, and was\ngiven at a time when the phenomenon was not understood properly.\n\nTo understand the significance of ε, consider a resistor R\nconnected across the cell (Fig. 3.18). A current I flows across R\nfrom C to D. As explained before, a steady current is maintained\nbecause current flows from N to P through the electrolyte. Clearly,\n\nacross the electrolyte the same current flows through the electrolyte\nbut from N to P, whereas through R, it flows from P to N.\n\nThe electrolyte through which a current flows has a finite\n\nresistance r, called the internal resistance. Consider first the\nsituation when R is infinite so that I = V/R = 0, where V is the\npotential difference between P and N. Now,\n\nV = Potential difference between P and A\n       + Potential difference between A and B\n       + Potential  difference between B and N\n\n   = ε (3.56)\nThus, emf ε is the potential difference between the positive and\nnegative electrodes in an open circuit, i.e., when no current is\n\nflowing through the cell.\nIf however R is finite, I is not zero. In that case the potential\n\ndifference between P and N is\n\nV = V\n+\n+ V\n\n–\n – I r\n\n   = ε – I r (3.57)\nNote the negative sign in the expression (I r ) for the potential difference\n\nbetween A and B. This is because the current I flows from B to A in the\n\nelectrolyte.\n\nIn  practical calculations, internal resistances of cells in the circuit\nmay be neglected when the  current I is such that ε >> I r. The actual\nvalues of the internal resistances of cells vary from cell to cell. The internal\n\nresistance of dry cells, however, is much higher than the common\n\nelectrolytic cells.\n\nFIGURE 3.18 (a) Sketch of\nan electrolyte cell with\n\npositive terminal P and\nnegative terminal N. The\n\ngap between the electrodes\n\nis exaggerated for clarity. A\nand B are points in the\n\nelectrolyte typically close to\n\nP and N. (b) the symbol for\na cell, + referring to P and\n\n– referring to the N\n\nelectrode. Electrical\nconnections to the cell are\n\nmade at P and N.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nCurrent\n\nElectricity\n\n111\n\nWe also observe that since V is the potential difference across R, we\nhave from Ohm’s law\n\nV = I  R (3.58)\n\nCombining Eqs. (3.57) and (3.58), we get\n\nI  R   =  ε – I  r\n\nOr, I\nR r\n\n=\n+\nε\n\n(3.59)\n\nThe maximum current that can be drawn from a cell is for R = 0 and\nit is I\n\nmax\n = ε/r. However, in most cells the maximum allowed current is\n\nmuch lower than this to prevent permanent damage to the cell.\n\nCHARGES IN CLOUDS\n\nIn olden days lightning was considered as an atmospheric flash of supernatural origin.\n\nIt was believed to be the great weapon of Gods. But today the phenomenon of lightning\ncan be explained scientifically by elementary principles of physics.\n\nAtmospheric electricity arises due to the separation of electric charges. In the\n\nionosphere and magnetosphere strong electric current is generated from the solar-\nterrestrial interaction. In the lower atmosphere, the current is weaker and is maintained\nby thunderstorm.\n\nThere are ice particles in the clouds, which grow, collide, fracture and break apart.\nThe smaller particles acquire positive charge and the larger ones negative charge. These\ncharged particles get separated by updrifts in the clouds and gravity. The upper portion\n\nof the cloud becomes positively charged and the middle negatively charged, leading to\ndipole structure. Sometimes a very weak positive charge is found near the base of the\ncloud. The ground is positively charged at the time of thunderstorm development. Also,\n\ncosmic and radioactive radiations ionise air into positive and negative ions and the air\nbecomes (weakly) electrically conductive. The separation of charges produce tremendous\namount of electrical potential within the cloud, as well, as between the cloud and ground.\n\nThis can amount to millions of volts and eventually the electrical resistance in the air\nbreaks down and lightning flash begins and thousands of amperes of current flows. The\nelectric field is of the order of 10\n\n5\n V/m. A lightning flash is composed of a series of\n\nstrokes with an average of about four and the duration of each flash is about 30 seconds.\nThe average peak power per stroke is about 10\n\n12\n watts.\n\nDuring fair weather also there is charge in the atmosphere. The fair weather electric\n\nfield arises due to the existence of a surface charge density at ground and an atmospheric\nconductivity, as well as, due to the flow of current from the ionosphere to the earth’s\nsurface, which is of the order of picoampere / square metre. The surface charge density\n\nat ground is negative; the electric field is directed downward. Over land the average\nelectric field is about 120 V/m, which corresponds to a surface charge density of\n–1.2 × 10\n\n–9\n C/m\n\n2\n. Over the entire earth’s surface, the total negative charge amount to\n\nabout 600 kC. An equal positive charge exists in the atmosphere. This electric field is not\nnoticeable in daily life. The reason why it is not noticed is that virtually everything, including\nour bodies, is conductor compared to air.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n112  E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 3\n\n.5\n\nExample 3.5 A network of resistors is connected to a 16 V battery\n\nwith internal resistance of 1Ω, as shown in Fig. 3.19: (a) Compute\nthe equivalent resistance of the network.

(c) Obtain the voltage drops V\n\nAB\n, V\n\nBC\n and V\n\nCD\n.\n\nFIGURE 3.19\n\nSolution\n(a) The network is a simple series and parallel combination of\n\nresistors. First the two 4Ω resistors in parallel are equivalent to a\nresistor = [(4 × 4)/(4 + 4)] Ω = 2 Ω.\nIn the same way, the 12 Ω and 6 Ω resistors in parallel are\nequivalent to a resistor of\n\n[(12 × 6)/(12 + 6)] Ω = 4 Ω.\nThe equivalent resistance R of the network is obtained by\ncombining these resistors (2 Ω and 4 Ω) with 1 Ω in series,\nthat is,\nR = 2 Ω + 4 Ω + 1 Ω = 7 Ω.\n\n(b) The total current I in the circuit is\n\n16\n2 A\n\n(7 1)\n\nε\n= = =\n\n+ + Ω\n\nV\nI\n\nR r\n\nConsider the resistors between A and B. If I\n1\n is the current in one\n\nof the 4 Ω resistors and I\n2\n the current in the other,\n\nI\n1\n × 4 = I\n\n2\n × 4\n\nthat is, I\n1\n = I\n\n2\n, which is otherwise obvious from the symmetry of\n\nthe two arms. But I\n1\n + I\n\n2\n = I = 2 A. Thus,\n\nI\n1\n = I\n\n2\n = 1 A\n\nthat is, current in each 4 Ω resistor is 1 A. Current in 1 Ω resistor\nbetween B and C would be 2 A.\nNow, consider the resistances between C and D. If I\n\n3\n is the current\n\nin the 12 Ω resistor, and I\n4\n in the 6 Ω resistor,\n\nI\n3\n × 12 = I\n\n4\n × 6, i.e., I\n\n4\n = 2I\n\n3\n\n      But, I\n3\n + I\n\n4\n = I = 2 A\n\n      Thus, I\n3\n =\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7  A, I4 =  \n\n4\n\n3\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7  A\n\nthat is, the current in the 12 Ω resistor is (2/3) A, while the current\nin the 6 Ω resistor is (4/3) A.\n\n(c) The voltage drop across AB is\n\nV\nAB\n\n = I\n1\n × 4 = 1 A × 4 Ω = 4 V,\n\nThis can also be obtained by multiplying the total current between\n\nA and B by the equivalent resistance between A and B, that is,\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nCurrent\n\nElectricity\n\n113\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 3\n\n.5\n\nV\nAB\n\n = 2 A × 2 Ω = 4 V\n\nThe voltage drop across BC is\n\nV\nBC\n\n = 2 A × 1 Ω = 2 V\n\nFinally, the voltage drop across CD is\n\nV\nCD\n\n = 12 Ω × I\n3\n = 12 Ω × \n\n2\n\n3\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7  A = 8 V.\n\nThis can alternately be obtained by multiplying total current\nbetween C and D by the equivalent resistance between C and D,\n\nthat is,\n\nV\nCD\n\n = 2 A × 4 Ω = 8 V\nNote that the total voltage drop across AD is 4 V + 2 V + 8 V = 14 V.\n\nThus, the terminal voltage of the battery is 14 V, while its emf is 16 V.\nThe loss of the voltage (= 2 V) is accounted for by the internal resistance\n\n1 Ω of the battery [2 A × 1 Ω = 2 V].\n\n3.12  CELLS IN SERIES AND IN PARALLEL\nLike resistors, cells can be combined together in an electric circuit. And\nlike resistors, one can, for calculating currents and voltages in a circuit,\nreplace a combination of cells by an equivalent cell.\n\nFIGURE 3.20 Two cells of emf’s ε\n1\n and ε\n\n2\n in the series. r\n\n1\n, r\n\n2\n are their\n\ninternal resistances. For connections across A and C, the combination\n\ncan be considered as one cell of emf ε\neq\n\n and an internal resistance r\neq\n\n.\n\nConsider first  two cells in series (Fig. 3.20), where one terminal of the\ntwo cells is joined together leaving the other terminal in either cell free.\nε\n\n1\n, ε\n\n2\n are the emf’s of the two cells and r\n\n1\n, r\n\n2\n their internal resistances,\n\nrespectively.\n\nLet V (A), V (B), V (C) be the potentials at points A, B and C shown in\n\nFig. 3.20. Then V (A) – V (B) is the potential difference between the positive\n\nand negative terminals of the first cell. We have already calculated it in\n\nEq. (3.57) and hence,\n\nAB 1 1(A) – (B) –V V V I rε≡ = (3.60)\n\nSimilarly,\n\nBC 2 2(B) – (C) –V V V I rε≡ = (3.61)\n\nHence, the potential difference between the terminals A and C of the\n\ncombination is\n\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( )AC (A) – (C) A – B B – CV V V V V V V≡ = +        \n       ( ) ( )1 2 1 2– I r rε ε= + + (3.62)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n114\n\nIf we wish to replace the combination by a single cell between A and\nC of emf ε\n\neq\n and internal resistance r\n\neq\n, we would have\n\nV\nAC\n\n = ε\neq\n\n– I r\neq\n\n(3.63)\n\nComparing the last two equations, we get\n\n  ε\neq\n\n = ε\n1\n + ε\n\n2\n(3.64)\n\nand  r\neq\n\n = r\n1\n + r\n\n2\n(3.65)\n\nIn Fig.3.20, we had connected the negative electrode of the first to the\npositive electrode of the second. If instead we connect the two negatives,\n\nEq. (3.61) would change to V\nBC\n\n = –ε\n2\n–Ir\n\n2\n and we will get\n\nε\neq\n\n = ε\n1\n – ε2         (ε1 > ε2) (3.66)\n\nThe rule for series combination clearly can be extended to any number\n\nof cells:\n(i) The equivalent emf of a series combination of n cells is just the sum of\n\ntheir individual emf’s, and\n\n(ii) The equivalent internal resistance of a series combination of n cells is\njust the sum of their internal resistances.\n\nThis is so, when the current leaves each cell from the positive\n\nelectrode. If in the combination, the current leaves any cell from\nthe negative electrode, the emf of the cell enters the expression\nfor ε\n\neq\n with a negative sign, as in Eq. (3.66).\n\nNext, consider a parallel combination of the cells (Fig. 3.21).\nI\n1\n and I\n\n2\n are the currents leaving the positive electrodes of the\n\ncells. At the point B\n1\n, I\n\n1\n and I\n\n2\n flow in whereas the current I flows\n\nout. Since as much charge flows in as out, we have\n\nI = I\n1\n + I\n\n2\n(3.67)\n\nLet V (B\n1\n) and V (B\n\n2\n) be the potentials at B\n\n1\n and B\n\n2\n, respectively.\n\nThen, considering the first cell, the potential difference across its\nterminals is V (B\n\n1\n) – V (B\n\n2\n). Hence, from Eq. (3.57)\n\n( ) ( )1 2 1 1 1– –V V B V B I rε≡ = (3.68)\nPoints B\n\n1\n and B\n\n2\n are connected exactly similarly to the second\n\ncell. Hence considering the second cell, we also have\n\n( ) ( )1 2 2 2 2– –V V B V B I rε≡ = (3.69)\nCombining the last three equations\n\n1 2    I I I= +\n\n    = + = +\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n+\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\nε ε ε ε1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2 1 2\n\n1 1– –\n–\n\nV\n\nr\n\nV\n\nr r r\nV\n\nr r\n(3.70)\n\nHence, V is given by,\n\n1 2 2 1 1 2\n\n1 2 1 2\n\n–\nr r r r\n\nV I\nr r r r\n\nε ε+\n=\n\n+ + (3.71)\n\nIf we want to replace the combination by a single cell, between B\n1\n and\n\nB\n2\n, of emf ε\n\neq\n and internal resistance r\n\neq\n, we would have\n\nV = ε\neq \n\n– I r\neq\n\n(3.72)\n\nFIGURE 3.21 Two cells in\n\nparallel.

The formulae we have\nderived earlier for series and parallel combinations of resistors are not\n\nalways sufficient to determine all the currents and potential differences\nin the circuit. Two rules, called Kirchhoff’s rules, are very useful for\nanalysis of electric circuits.\n\nGiven a circuit, we start by labelling currents in each resistor by a\nsymbol, say I, and a directed arrow to indicate that a current I flows\nalong the resistor in the direction indicated. If ultimately I is determined\n\nto be positive, the actual current in the resistor is in the direction of the\narrow. If I turns out to be negative, the current actually flows in a direction\nopposite to the arrow. Similarly, for each source (i.e., cell or some other\n\nsource of electrical power) the positive and negative electrodes are labelled,\nas well as, a directed arrow with a symbol for the current flowing through\nthe cell.

If, while labelling\n\nthe current I through the cell one goes from P to N,\nthen of course\n\nV = ε + I r (3.79)\nHaving clarified labelling, we now state the rules\n\nand the proof:\n(a) Junction rule: At any junction, the sum of the\n\ncurrents entering the junction is equal to the\n\nsum of currents leaving the junction (Fig. 3.22).\nThis applies equally well if instead of a junction of\nseveral lines, we consider a point in a line.\n\nThe proof of this rule follows from the fact that\nwhen currents are steady, there is no accumulation\nof charges at any junction or at any point in a line.\n\nThus, the total current flowing in, (which is the rate\nat which charge flows into the junction), must equal\nthe total current flowing out.\n\n(b) Loop rule: The algebraic sum of changes in\npotential around any closed loop involving\n\nresistors and cells in the loop is zero (Fig. 3.22).\n\nThis rule is also obvious, since electric potential is\ndependent on the location of the point. Thus starting with any point if we\ncome back to the same point, the total change must be zero. In a closed\n\nloop, we do come back to the starting point and hence the rule.\n\nExample 3.6 A battery of 10 V and negligible internal resistance is\nconnected across the diagonally opposite corners of a cubical network\n\nconsisting of 12 resistors each of resistance 1 Ω (Fig. 3.23).

There is, however, a clear symmetry in the\n\nproblem which we can exploit to obtain the equivalent resistance of\nthe network.\nThe paths AA′, AD and AB are obviously symmetrically placed in the\nnetwork. Thus, the current in each must be the same, say, I. Further,\nat the corners A′, B and D, the incoming current I must split equally\ninto the two outgoing branches. In this manner, the current in all\n\nthe 12 edges of the cube are easily written down in terms of I, using\nKirchhoff’s first rule and the symmetry in the problem.\nNext take a closed loop, say, ABCC′EA, and apply Kirchhoff’s second\nrule:\n\n–IR – (1/2)IR – IR + ε = 0\nwhere R is the resistance of each edge and ε the emf of battery. Thus,\n\nε = \n5\n\n2\nI R\n\nThe equivalent resistance R\neq\n\n of the network is\n\n5\n\n3 6\neq\n\nR R\nI\n\nε\n= =\n\nFor R = 1 Ω, R\neq\n\n = (5/6) Ω and for ε = 10 V, the total current (= 3I ) in\nthe network is\n\n3I = 10 V/(5/6) Ω = 12 A, i.e., I = 4 A\nThe current flowing in each edge can now be read off from the\n\nFig. 3.23.\n\nIt should be noted that because of the symmetry of the network, the\ngreat power of Kirchhoff’s rules has not been very apparent in Example 3.6.\nIn a general network, there will be no such simplification due to\n\nsymmetry, and only by application of Kirchhoff’s rules to junctions and\nclosed loops (as many as necessary to solve the unknowns in the network)\ncan we handle the problem. This will be illustrated in Example 3.7.\n\nExample 3.7 Determine the current in each branch of the network\nshown in Fig. 3.24.\n\nFIGURE 3.24\n\nS\nim\n\nila\ntio\n\nn\n \nfo\n\nr\n \na\n\np\np\n\nlic\na\n\ntio\nn\n\n \no\n\nf \nK\n\nir\nc\nh\n\nh\no\n\nff\n’s\n\n \nr\nu\n\nle\ns\n:\n\nh\nttp\n\n://w\nw\n\nw\n.p\n\nh\ny\ns.h\n\na\nw\n\na\nii.e\n\nd\nu\n/~\n\nte\nb\n/o\n\np\ntic\n\ns/ja\nv\na\n/k\n\nirc\nh\n3\n/\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 3\n\n.7\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n118\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 3\n\n.7\n\nSolution  Each branch of the network is assigned an unknown current\nto be determined by the application of Kirchhoff’s rules. To reduce\n\nthe number of unknowns at the outset, the first rule of Kirchhoff is\nused at every junction to assign the unknown current in each branch.\nWe then have three unknowns I\n\n1\n, I\n\n2\n and I\n\n3\n which can be found by\n\napplying the second rule of Kirchhoff to three different closed loops.\nKirchhoff’s second rule for the closed loop ADCA gives,\n\n10 – 4(I\n1\n– I\n\n2\n) + 2(I\n\n2\n + I\n\n3\n – I\n\n1\n) – I\n\n1\n = 0 [3.80(a)]\n\nthat is, 7I\n1\n– 6I\n\n2\n – 2I\n\n3\n = 10\n\nFor the closed loop ABCA, we get\n\n10 – 4I\n2\n– 2 (I\n\n2\n + I\n\n3\n) – I\n\n1\n = 0\n\nthat is, I\n1\n + 6I\n\n2\n + 2I\n\n3\n =10 [3.80(b)]\n\nFor the closed loop BCDEB, we get\n\n5 – 2 (I\n2\n + I\n\n3\n) – 2 (I\n\n2\n + I\n\n3\n – I\n\n1\n) = 0\n\nthat is, 2I\n1\n – 4I\n\n2\n – 4I\n\n3\n = –5 [3.80(c)]\n\nEquations (3.80 a, b, c) are three simultaneous equations in three\n\nunknowns. These can be solved by the usual method to give\n\nI\n1\n = 2.5A,   I\n\n2\n = \n\n5\n\n8\n A,   I\n\n3\n = \n\n7\n1\n\n8\n  A\n\nThe currents in the various branches of the network are\n\nAB : \n5\n\n8\n A,   CA : \n\n1\n2\n\n2\n A,   DEB : \n\n7\n1\n\n8\n  A\n\nAD : \n7\n\n1\n8\n\n A,   CD : 0 A,   BC : \n1\n\n2\n2\n\n A\n\nIt is easily verified that Kirchhoff’s second rule applied to the\n\nremaining closed loops does not provide any additional independent\nequation, that is, the above values of currents satisfy the second\nrule for every closed loop of the network. For example, the total voltage\n\ndrop over the closed loop BADEB\n\n5\n5\n\n8\n4\n\n15\n\n8\n4V V V+ ×\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n− ×\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\nequal to zero, as required by Kirchhoff’s second rule.\n\n3.14  WHEATSTONE BRIDGE\nAs an application of Kirchhoff’s rules consider the circuit shown in\n\nFig. 3.25, which is called the Wheatstone bridge. The bridge has\n\nfour resistors R\n1\n, R\n\n2\n, R\n\n3\n and R\n\n4\n. Across one pair of diagonally opposite\n\npoints (A and C in the figure) a source is connected. This (i.e., AC) is\n\ncalled the battery arm. Between the other two vertices, B and D, a\n\ngalvanometer G (which is a device to detect currents) is connected. This\n\nline, shown as BD in the figure, is called the galvanometer arm.\n\nFor simplicity, we assume that the cell has no internal resistance. In\ngeneral there will be currents flowing across all the resistors as well as a\n\ncurrent I\ng\n through G. Of special interest, is the case of a balanced bridge\n\nwhere the resistors are such that I\ng\n = 0. We can easily get the balance\n\ncondition, such that there is no current through G. In this case, the\n\nKirchhoff’s junction rule applied to junctions D and B (see the figure)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nCurrent\n\nElectricity\n\n119\n\nimmediately gives us the relations I\n1\n = I\n\n3\n and I\n\n2\n = I\n\n4\n. Next, we apply\n\nKirchhoff’s loop rule to closed loops ADBA and CBDC. The first\nloop gives\n\n–I\n1\n R\n\n1\n + 0 + I\n\n2\n R\n\n2\n = 0        (I\n\ng\n = 0)  (3.81)\n\nand the second loop gives, upon using I\n3\n = I\n\n1\n, I\n\n4\n = I\n\n2\n\nI\n2\n R\n\n4\n + 0 – I\n\n1\n R\n\n3\n = 0        (3.82)\n\nFrom Eq. (3.81), we obtain,\n\n1 2\n\n2 1\n\nI R\n\nI R\n=\n\nwhereas from Eq. (3.82), we obtain,\n\n1 4\n\n2 3\n\nI R\n\nI R\n=\n\nHence, we obtain the condition\n\n2 4\n\n1 3\n\nR R\n\nR R\n= [3.83(a)]\n\n This last equation relating the four resistors is called the balance\ncondition for the galvanometer to give zero or null deflection.\n\nThe Wheatstone bridge and its balance condition provide a practical\nmethod for determination of an unknown resistance. Let us suppose we\nhave an unknown resistance, which we insert in the fourth arm; R\n\n4\n is\n\nthus not known. Keeping known resistances R\n1\n and R\n\n2\n in the first and\n\nsecond arm of the bridge, we go on varying R\n3\n till the galvanometer shows\n\na null deflection. The bridge then is balanced, and from the balance\ncondition the value of the unknown resistance R\n\n4\n is given by,\n\n2\n4 3\n\n1\n\nR\nR R\n\nR\n= [3.83(b)]\n\nA practical device using this principle is called the meter bridge. It\nwill be discussed in the next section.\n\nExample 3.8 The four arms of a Wheatstone bridge (Fig. 3.26) have\n\nthe following resistances:\nAB = 100Ω, BC = 10Ω, CD = 5Ω, and DA = 60Ω.\n\nFIGURE 3.26\n\nFIGURE 3.25\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 3\n\n.8\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n120\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 3\n\n.8\n\n A galvanometer of 15Ω resistance is connected across BD.

It consists of\na wire of length 1m and of uniform cross sectional\n\narea stretched taut and clamped between two thick\n\nmetallic strips bent at right angles, as shown. The\n\nmetallic strip has two gaps across which resistors can\nbe connected. The end points where the wire is\n\nclamped are connected to a cell through a key. One\n\nend of a galvanometer is connected to the metallic\n\nstrip midway between the two gaps. The other end of\nthe galvanometer is connected to a ‘jockey’. The jockey\n\nis essentially a metallic rod whose one end has a\n\nknife-edge which can slide over the wire to make\n\nelectrical connection.\nR is an unknown resistance whose value we want to determine. It is\n\nconnected across one of the gaps. Across the other gap, we connect a\n\nFIGURE 3.27 A meter bridge. Wire AC\n\nis 1 m long. R is a resistance to be\nmeasured and S is a standard\n\nresistance.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nCurrent\n\nElectricity\n\n121\n\nstandard known resistance S. The jockey is connected to some point D\non the wire, a distance l  cm from the end A. The jockey can be moved\n\nalong the wire. The portion AD of the wire has a resistance R\ncm\n\nl, where\nR\n\ncm\n  is the  resistance of the wire per unit centimetre. The portion DC of\n\nthe wire similarly has a resistance R\ncm\n\n  (100-l ).\nThe four arms AB, BC, DA and CD  [with resistances R, S, R\n\ncm\n l and\n\nR\ncm\n\n(100-l )] obviously form a Wheatstone bridge with AC as the battery\narm and BD the galvanometer arm. If the jockey is moved along the wire,\n\nthen there will be one position where the galvanometer will show no\ncurrent. Let the distance of the jockey from the end A at the balance\npoint be l= l\n\n1\n. The four resistances of the bridge at the balance point then\n\nare R, S,  R\ncm\n\n l\n1\n and  R\n\ncm\n(100–l\n\n1\n). The balance condition, Eq. [3.83(a)]\n\ngives\n\n( )\n1 1\n\n1 1100 – 100 –\ncm\n\ncm\n\nR l lR\n\nS R l l\n= = (3.85)\n\nThus, once we have found out l\n1\n, the unknown resistance R is known\n\nin terms of the standard known resistance S by\n\n1\n\n1100 –\n\nl\nR S\n\nl\n= (3.86)\n\nBy choosing various values of S, we would get various values of l\n1\n,\n\nand calculate R each time. An error in measurement of l\n1\n would naturally\n\nresult in an error in R. It can be shown that the percentage error in R  can\nbe minimised by adjusting the balance point near the middle of the\n\nbridge, i.e., when l\n1\n is close to 50 cm. (This requires a suitable choice\n\nof S.)\n\nExample 3.9 In a meter bridge (Fig. 3.27), the null point is found at a\n\ndistance of 33.7 cm from A. If now a resistance of 12Ω is connected in\nparallel with S, the null point occurs at 51.9 cm. Determine the values\nof R and S.\n\nSolution  From the first balance point, we get\n\n33.7\n\n66.3\n\nR\n\nS\n= (3.87)\n\nAfter S is connected in parallel with a resistance of 12Ω , the resistance\nacross the gap changes from S to S\n\neq\n, where\n\n12\n\n12\neq\n\nS\nS\n\nS\n=\n\n+\nand hence the new balance condition now gives\n\n( )1251.9\n48.1 12\n\neq\n\nR SR\n\nS S\n\n+\n= = (3.88)\n\nSubstituting the value of R/S from Eq.

It is basically a long piece of uniform wire,\nsometimes a few meters in length across which a standard cell (B) is\n\nconnected. In actual design, the wire is sometimes cut in several pieces\nplaced side by side and connected at the ends by thick metal strip.\n(Fig. 3.28). In the figure, the wires run from A to C. The small vertical\n\nportions are the thick metal strips connecting the various sections of\nthe wire.\n\nA current I flows through the wire which can be varied by a variable\n\nresistance (rheostat, R) in the circuit. Since the wire is uniform, the\npotential difference between A and any point at a distance l from A is\n\n( )ε φ=l l (3.89)\nwhere φ is the potential drop per unit length.\n\nFigure 3.28 (a) shows an application of the potentiometer to compare\nthe emf of two cells of emf ε\n\n1\n and ε\n\n2\n . The points marked 1, 2, 3 form a two\n\nway key. Consider first a position of the key where 1 and 3 are connected\nso that the galvanometer is connected to ε\n\n1\n. The jockey\n\nis moved along the wire till at a point N\n1\n, at a distance l\n\n1\n\nfrom A, there is no deflection in the galvanometer. We\ncan apply Kirchhoff’s loop rule to the closed loop\nAN\n\n1\nG31A and get,\n\nφ l\n1\n + 0 – ε\n\n1\n = 0 (3.90)\n\nSimilarly, if another emf ε\n2\n is balanced against l\n\n2\n (AN\n\n2\n)\n\nφ l\n2\n + 0 – ε\n\n2\n = 0 (3.91)\n\nFrom the last two equations\n\n1 1\n\n2 2\n\nl\n\nl\n\nε\nε\n\n= (3.92)\n\nThis simple mechanism thus allows one to compare\n\nthe emf’s of any two sources (ε\n1\n,ε\n\n2\n). In practice one of the\n\ncells is chosen as a standard cell whose emf is known to\na high degree of accuracy. The emf of the other cell is\n\nthen easily calculated from Eq. (3.92).\nWe can also use a potentiometer to measure internal\n\nresistance of a cell [Fig. 3.28 (b)]. For this the cell (emf ε )\nwhose internal resistance (r) is to be determined is\nconnected across a resistance box through a key K\n\n2\n, as\n\nshown in the figure. With key K\n2\n open, balance is\n\nobtained at length l\n1\n (AN\n\n1\n). Then,\n\nε = φ l\n1\n\n[3.93(a)]\n\nWhen key K\n2\n is closed, the cell sends a current (I )\n\nthrough the resistance box (R). If V is the terminal\n\npotential difference of the cell and balance is obtained at\nlength l\n\n2 \n(AN\n\n2\n),\n\nV = φ l\n2\n\n[3.93(b)]\n\nFIGURE 3.28 A potentiometer.

This gives\nε/V = (r+R )/R [3.94(b)]\n\nFrom Eq.

As such it is unaffected by the internal\nresistance of the source.\n\nExample 3.10  A resistance of R Ω draws current from a\npotentiometer.

To maintain a steady current, we must have a closed circuit in which\n\nan external agency moves electric charge from lower to higher potential\n\nenergy. The work done per unit charge by the source in taking the\n\ncharge from lower to higher potential energy (i.e., from one terminal\n\nof the source to the other) is called the electromotive force, or emf, of\n\nthe source. Note that the emf is not a force; it is the voltage difference\nbetween the two terminals of a source in open circuit.\n\n3. Ohm’s law: The electric current I flowing through a substance is\n\nproportional to the voltage V across its ends, i.e., V ∝ I or V = RI,\nwhere R is called the resistance of the substance. The unit of resistance\n\nis ohm: 1Ω = 1 V A–1.\n4. The resistance R of a conductor depends on its length l and\n\ncross-sectional area A through the relation,\n\nl\nR\n\nA\n\nρ\n=\n\nwhere ρ, called resistivity is a property of the material and depends on\ntemperature and pressure.\n\n5. Electrical resistivity of substances varies over a very wide range. Metals\n\nhave low resistivity, in the range of 10\n–8\n\n Ω m to 10–6 Ω m. Insulators\nlike glass and rubber have 10\n\n22\n to 10\n\n24\n times greater resistivity.\n\nSemiconductors like Si and Ge lie roughly in the middle range of\n\nresistivity on a logarithmic scale.\n\n6. In most substances, the carriers of current are electrons; in some\n\ncases, for example, ionic crystals and electrolytic liquids, positive and\n\nnegative ions carry the electric current.\n\n7. Current density j gives the amount of charge flowing per second per\nunit area normal to the flow,\n\nj = nq v\nd\n\nwhere n is the number density (number per unit volume) of charge\n\ncarriers each of charge q, and v\nd\n is the drift velocity of the charge\n\ncarriers. For electrons q = – e. If j is normal to a cross-sectional area\nA and is constant over the area, the magnitude of the current I through\nthe area is nev\n\nd\n A.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nCurrent\n\nElectricity\n\n125\n\n8. Using E = V/l, I = nev\nd\n A, and Ohm’s law, one obtains\n\n2\n\nd\n\neE ne\nv\n\nm m\nρ=\n\nThe proportionality between the force eE on the electrons in a metal\n\ndue to the external field E and the drift velocity v\nd\n (not acceleration)\n\ncan be understood, if we assume that the electrons suffer collisions\nwith ions in the metal, which deflect them randomly. If such collisions\n\noccur on an average at a time interval τ,\nv\n\nd\n = aτ = eEτ/m\n\nwhere a is the acceleration of the electron. This gives\n\n2\n\nm\n\nne\nρ\n\nτ\n=\n\n9. In the temperature range in which resistivity increases linearly with\n\ntemperature, the temperature coefficient of resistivity α is defined as\nthe fractional increase in resistivity per unit increase in temperature.\n\n10. Ohm’s law is obeyed by many substances, but it is not a fundamental\n\nlaw of nature. It fails if\n\n(a) V depends on I non-linearly.\n(b) the relation between V and I depends on the sign of V for the same\n\nabsolute value of V.\n\n(c) The relation between V and I is non-unique.\n\nAn example of (a) is when ρ increases with I (even if temperature is\nkept fixed). A rectifier combines features (a) and (b). GaAs shows the\n\nfeature (c).\n\n11. When a source of emf ε is connected to an external resistance R, the\nvoltage V\n\next\n across R is given by\n\nV\next\n\n = IR = R\nR r\n\nε\n+\n\nwhere r is the internal resistance of the source.\n\n12. (a) Total resistance R of n resistors connected in series is  given by\n\nR = R\n1\n + R\n\n2\n +..... + R\n\nn\n\n(b) Total resistance R of n resistors connected in parallel is given by\n\n1 2\n\n1 1 1 1\n......\n\nn\nR R R R\n\n= + + +\n\n13. Kirchhoff’s Rules –\n\n(a) Junction Rule: At any junction of circuit elements, the sum of\n\ncurrents entering the junction must equal the sum of currents\n\nleaving it.\n\n(b) Loop Rule: The algebraic sum of changes in potential around any\n\nclosed loop must be zero.\n\n14. The Wheatstone bridge is an arrangement of four resistances – R\n1\n, R\n\n2\n,\n\nR\n3\n, R\n\n4\n as shown in the text. The null-point condition is given by\n\n31\n\n2 4\n\nRR\n\nR R\n=\n\nusing which the value of one resistance can be determined, knowing\n\nthe other three resistances.\n\n15. The potentiometer is a device to compare potential differences. Since\n\nthe method involves a condition of no current flow, the device can be\n\nused to measure potential difference; internal resistance of a cell and\n\ncompare emf’s of two sources.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n126\n\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n\n1. Current is a scalar although we represent current with an arrow.\n\nCurrents do not obey the  law of vector addition. That current is a\nscalar also follows from it’s  definition. The current I through an area\n\nof cross-section is given by the scalar product of two vectors:\n\nI =  j . ∆S\n\nwhere j and ∆S are vectors.\n2. Refer to V-I curves of a resistor and a diode as drawn in the text. A\n\nresistor obeys Ohm’s law while a diode does not. The assertion that\nV = IR is a statement of Ohm’s law is not true. This equation defines\n\nresistance and it may be applied to all conducting devices whether\n\nthey obey Ohm’s law or not. The Ohm’s law asserts that the plot of I\n\nversus V is linear i.e., R is independent of V.\n\nEquation E = ρ j leads to another statement of Ohm’s law, i.e., a\nconducting material obeys Ohm’s law when the resistivity of the\nmaterial does not depend on the magnitude and direction of applied\n\nelectric field.\n\n3. Homogeneous conductors like silver or semiconductors like pure\n\ngermanium or germanium containing impurities obey Ohm’s law\n\nwithin some range of electric field values. If the field becomes too\n\nstrong, there are departures from Ohm’s law in all cases.\n\n4.

However, it was only about 200 years ago, in 1820, that it was\nrealised that they were intimately related*. During a lecture demonstration\n\nin the summer of 1820, Danish physicist Hans Christian Oersted noticed\nthat a current in a straight wire caused a noticeable deflection in a nearby\nmagnetic compass needle. He investigated this phenomenon. He found\n\nthat the alignment of the needle is tangential to an imaginary circle which\nhas the straight wire as its centre and has its plane perpendicular to the\nwire. This situation is depicted in Fig.4.1(a). It is noticeable when the\n\ncurrent is large and the needle sufficiently close to the wire so that the\nearth’s magnetic field may be ignored. Reversing the direction of the\ncurrent reverses the orientation of the needle [Fig. 4.1(b)]. The deflection\n\nincreases on increasing the current or bringing the needle closer to the\nwire. Iron filings sprinkled around the wire arrange themselves in\nconcentric circles with the wire as the centre [Fig. 4.1(c)]. Oersted\n\nconcluded that moving charges or currents produced a magnetic field\nin the surrounding space.\n\nFollowing this, there was intense experimentation. In 1864, the laws\n\nobeyed by electricity and magnetism were unified and formulated by\n\nChapter Four\n\nMOVING CHARGES\n\nAND MAGNETISM\n\n* See the box in Chapter 1, Page 3.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nMoving Charges and\n\nMagnetism\n\n133\n\nJames Maxwell who then realised that light was electromagnetic waves.\nRadio waves were discovered by Hertz, and produced by  J.C.Bose and\n\nG. Marconi by the end of the 19\nth\n\n century. A  remarkable scientific and\ntechnological progress took place in the 20\n\nth\n century. This was due to\n\nour increased understanding of electromagnetism and the invention of\n\ndevices for production, amplification, transmission and detection of\nelectromagnetic waves.\n\nIn this chapter, we will see how magnetic field exerts\n\nforces on moving charged particles, like electrons,\n\nprotons, and current-carrying wires. We shall also learn\n\nhow currents produce magnetic fields. We shall see how\n\nparticles can be accelerated to very high energies in a\n\ncyclotron. We shall study how currents and voltages are\n\ndetected by a galvanometer.\n\nIn this and subsequent Chapter on magnetism,\n\nwe adopt the following convention: A current or a\nfield (electric or magnetic) emerging out of the plane of the\npaper is depicted by a dot (¤). A current or a field going\n\ninto the plane of the paper is depicted by a cross ( ⊗ )*.\nFigures. 4.1(a) and 4.1(b) correspond to these two\nsituations, respectively.\n\n4.2  MAGNETIC FORCE\n\n4.2.1  Sources and fields\n\nBefore we introduce the concept of a magnetic field B, we\n\nshall recapitulate what we have learnt in Chapter 1 about\n\nthe electric field E. We have seen that the interaction\n\nbetween two charges can be considered in two stages.\n\nThe charge Q, the source of the field, produces an electric\n\nfield E, where\n\nFIGURE 4.1 The magnetic field due to a straight long current-carrying\n\nwire. The wire is perpendicular to the plane of the paper. A ring of\ncompass needles surrounds the wire. The orientation of the needles is\n\nshown when (a) the current emerges out of the plane of the paper,\n\n(b) the current moves into the plane of the paper. (c) The arrangement of\niron filings around the wire. The darkened ends of the needle represent\n\nnorth poles. The effect of the earth’s magnetic field is neglected.\n\nHans Christian Oersted\n(1777–1851) Danish\n\nphysicist and chemist,\nprofessor at Copenhagen.\nHe observed that a\n\ncompass needle suffers a\ndeflection when placed\nnear a wire carrying an\n\nelectric current. This\ndiscovery gave the first\nempirical evidence of a\n\nconnection between electric\nand magnetic phenomena.\n\nH\nA\n\nN\nS\n\n C\nH\n\nR\nIS\n\nT\nIA\n\nN\n O\n\nE\nR\n\nS\nT\nE\n\nD\n  (1\n\n7\n7\n7\n–\n1\n8\n5\n1\n)\n\n* A dot appears like the tip of an arrow pointed at you, a cross is like the feathered\ntail of an arrow moving away from you.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n134\n\nE = Q \n\nr\n\n/ (4πε\n0\n)r\n\n2\n(4.1)\n\nwhere r̂  is unit vector along r,  and  the field E is a vector\nfield. A charge q interacts with this field and experiences\n\na force F given by\n\n     F  =  q  E   = q Q r̂   / (4πε\n0\n) r\n\n2\n(4.2)\n\nAs pointed out in the Chapter 1, the field  E is not\n\njust an artefact but has a physical role. It can  convey\n\nenergy and momentum and is not established\n\ninstantaneously but takes finite time to propagate. The\n\nconcept of a field was specially stressed by Faraday  and\n\nwas incorporated by Maxwell in his unification of\n\nelectricity and magnetism. In addition to depending on\n\neach point in space, it can also vary with time, i.e., be a\n\nfunction of time.  In our discussions in this chapter, we\n\nwill assume that the fields do not change with time.\n\nThe field at a particular point can be due to one or\n\nmore charges. If there are more charges the fields add\n\nvectorially. You have already learnt in Chapter 1 that\n\nthis is called the principle of superposition. Once the field\n\nis known, the force on a test charge is given by Eq. (4.2).\n\nJust as static charges produce an electric field, the\n\ncurrents or moving charges produce (in addition) a\n\nmagnetic field, denoted by B (r), again a vector field. It\n\nhas several basic properties identical to the electric field.\n\nIt is defined at each point in space (and can in addition\n\ndepend on time). Experimentally, it is found to obey the\n\nprinciple of superposition: the magnetic field of several\n\nsources is the vector addition of magnetic field of each\n\nindividual source.\n\n4.2.2  Magnetic Field,  Lorentz  Force\n\nLet us suppose that there is  a point charge q (moving\n\nwith a velocity v and, located at r at a given time t ) in\npresence of both the electric field E (r) and the magnetic\nfield B (r).  The force on an electric charge q due to both\n\nof them can be written as\n\nF   = q [ E (r) +  v × B (r)] ≡ F\nelectric\n\n +F\nmagnetic\n\n(4.3)\n\nThis force was given first  by H.A. Lorentz based on the extensive\n\nexperiments of Ampere and others. It is called the Lorentz force. You\nhave already studied in detail the force due to the electric field. If we\nlook at the interaction with the magnetic field, we find the following\n\nfeatures.\n(i) It depends on q, v and B (charge of the particle, the velocity and the\n\nmagnetic field). Force on a negative charge is opposite to that on a\n\npositive charge.\n\n(ii) The magnetic force q [ v × B ] includes a vector product of velocity\nand magnetic field. The vector product makes the force due to magnetic\n\nH\nE\n\nN\nD\n\nR\nIK\n\n A\nN\n\nT\nO\n\nO\nN\n\n L\nO\n\nR\nE\n\nN\nT\nZ\n (\n\n1\n8\n5\n3\n –\n\n 1\n9\n2\n8\n)\n\nHendrik Antoon Lorentz\n(1853 – 1928) Dutch\n\ntheoretical physicist,\nprofessor at Leiden.

In order to\nexplain the observed effect of\n\nmagnetic fields on emitters of\nlight (Zeeman effect), he\npostulated the existence of\n\nelectric charges in the atom,\nfor which he was awarded the\nNobel Prize in 1902.

Only a moving\n\ncharge feels the magnetic force.\nThe expression for the magnetic force helps\n\nus to define the unit of the magnetic field, if\n\none takes q, F and v, all to be unity in the force\n\nequation F = q [ v × B] =q v B sin θ n̂ ,  where θ\nis the angle between v and B [see  Fig. 4.2 (a)].\n\nThe magnitude of magnetic field B is 1 SI unit,\nwhen the force acting on a unit charge (1 C),\nmoving perpendicular to B with a speed 1m/s,\n\nis one newton.\nDimensionally, we have [B] = [F/qv] and the unit\nof B are Newton second / (coulomb metre).  This\n\nunit is called tesla (T) named after Nikola Tesla\n(1856 – 1943). Tesla is a rather large unit. A smaller  unit (non-SI) called\ngauss (=10–4 tesla) is also often used. The earth’s magnetic field is about\n\n3.6 × 10\n–5\n\n T.

Consider a rod of a\n\nuniform cross-sectional area A and length l. We shall assume one kind\nof mobile carriers as in a conductor (here electrons). Let the number\ndensity of these mobile charge carriers in it be n. Then the total number\n\nof mobile charge carriers in it is nlA. For a steady current I in this\nconducting rod, we may assume that each mobile carrier has an average\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n136  E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 4\n\n.1\n\ndrift velocity v\nd\n (see Chapter 3). In the presence of an external magnetic\n\nfield B, the force on these carriers is:\n\nF = (nlA)q v\nd\n ××××× B\n\nwhere q is the value of the charge on  a carrier.  Now nq v\nd\n is the current\n\ndensity j and |(nq v\nd\n)|A is the current I (see Chapter 3 for the discussion\n\nof current and current density). Thus,\n\nF = [(nq v\nd \n)lA] × B = [ jAl ] ××××× B\n\n   = Il ××××× B (4.4)\n\nwhere l is a vector of magnitude l, the length of the rod, and with a direction\nidentical to the current I. Note that the current I is not a vector. In the last\nstep leading to Eq. (4.4), we have transferred the vector sign from  j to l.\n\nEquation (4.4) holds for a straight rod. In this equation, B is the external\nmagnetic field. It is not the field produced by the current-carrying rod. If\nthe wire has an arbitrary shape we can calculate the Lorentz force on it\n\nby considering it as a collection of linear strips dl\nj\n and summing\n\nj\nj\n\nId ×= ∑F Bl\n\nThis summation can be converted to an integral in most cases.\n\nON PERMITTIVITY AND PERMEABILITY\n\nIn the universal law of gravitation, we say that any two point masses exert a force on\neach other which is proportional to the product of the masses m\n\n1\n, m\n\n2\n and inversely\n\nproportional to the square of the distance r between them. We write it as F = Gm\n1\nm\n\n2\n/r\n\n2\n\nwhere G is the universal constant of gravitation. Similarly, in Coulomb’s law of electrostatics\nwe write the force between two point charges q\n\n1\n, q\n\n2\n, separated by a distance r as\n\nF = kq\n1\nq\n\n2\n/r\n\n2\n where k is a constant of proportionality. In SI units, k is taken as\n\n1/4πε where ε is the permittivity of the medium. Also in magnetism, we get another\nconstant, which in SI units, is taken as µ/4π where µ is the permeability of the medium.\n\nAlthough G, ε and µ arise as proportionality constants, there is a difference between\ngravitational force and electromagnetic force. While the gravitational force does not depend\non the intervening medium, the electromagnetic force depends on the medium between\n\nthe two charges or magnets. Hence, while G is a universal constant, ε and µ depend on\nthe medium. They have different values for different media. The product εµ turns out to\nbe related to the speed v of electromagnetic radiation in the medium through εµ =1/ v\n\n 2\n.\n\nElectric permittivity ε is a physical quantity that describes how an electric field affects\nand is affected by a medium. It is determined by the ability of a material to polarise in\nresponse to an applied field, and thereby to cancel, partially, the field inside the material.\n\nSimilarly, magnetic permeability µ is the ability of a substance to acquire magnetisation in\nmagnetic fields. It is a measure of the extent to which magnetic field can penetrate matter.\n\nExample 4.1 A straight wire of mass 200 g and length 1.5 m carries\n\na current of 2 A. It is suspended in mid-air by a uniform horizontal\nmagnetic field B (Fig. 4.3). What is the magnitude of the magnetic\nfield?\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nMoving Charges and\n\nMagnetism\n\n137\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 4\n\n.1\nFIGURE 4.3\n\nSolution  From Eq. (4.4), we find that there is an upward force F, of\nmagnitude IlB,. For mid-air suspension, this must be balanced by\nthe force due to gravity:\n\nm g = I lB\n\n  \nm g\n\nB\nI l\n\n=\n\n     \n0.2 9.8\n\n0.65 T\n2 1.5\n\n×\n= =\n\n×\n\nNote that it would have been sufficient to specify m/l, the mass per\n\nunit length of the wire. The earth’s magnetic field is approximately\n4 × 10\n\n–5\n T and we have ignored it.\n\nExample 4.2 If the magnetic field is parallel to the positive y-axis\nand the charged particle is moving along the positive x-axis (Fig. 4.4),\nwhich way would the Lorentz force be for (a) an electron (negative\n\ncharge), (b) a proton (positive charge).\n\nFIGURE 4.4\n\nSolution   The velocity v of particle is along the x-axis, while B, the\nmagnetic field is along the y-axis, so v × B is along the z-axis (screw\nrule or right-hand thumb rule). So, (a) for electron it will be along –z\n\naxis. (b) for a positive charge (proton) the force is along +z axis.\n\n4.3  MOTION IN A MAGNETIC FIELD\nWe will now consider, in greater detail, the motion of a charge moving in\n\na  magnetic field.  We have learnt  in Mechanics (see Class XI book, Chapter\n\n6) that a force on a particle does work if  the force has a component along\n\n(or opposed to) the direction of motion of the particle.

So no work is done\n\nand no change in the magnitude of the velocity is produced\n(though the direction of momentum may be changed). [Notice\nthat this is unlike the force due to an electric field, qE, which\n\ncan have a component parallel (or antiparallel) to motion and\nthus can transfer energy in addition to momentum.]\n\nWe shall consider motion of a charged particle in a uniform\n\nmagnetic field. First consider the case of v perpendicular to B.\nThe perpendicular force, q v × B, acts as a centripetal force and\nproduces a circular motion perpendicular to the magnetic field.\n\nThe particle will describe a circle if v and B are  perpendicular\nto each other (Fig. 4.5).\n\nIf velocity has a component along B, this component\n\nremains unchanged as the motion along the magnetic field will\nnot be affected by the magnetic field. The motion\nin a plane perpendicular to B is as before a\n\ncircular one, thereby producing a helical motion\n(Fig. 4.6).\n\nYou have already learnt in earlier classes\n\n(See Class XI, Chapter 4) that if r is the radius\nof the circular path of a particle,  then a force of\nm v\n\n2 / r, acts perpendicular to the path towards\n\nthe centre of the circle, and is called the\ncentripetal force. If the velocity v is\nperpendicular to the magnetic field   B, the\n\nmagnetic force is  perpendicular to both v and\nB and acts like a centripetal force. It has a\nmagnitude q v B. Equating the two expressions\n\nfor centripetal force,\n\nm v\n 2\n/r = q v B, which gives\n\nr =  m v / qB (4.5)\n\nfor the radius of the circle described by the\ncharged particle. The larger the  momentum,\n\nthe larger is the radius and bigger the circle described. If ω is the angular\n\nfrequency, then   v = ω  r. So,\n\nω  = 2π ν =  q B/ m [4.6(a)]\n\nwhich is independent of the velocity or energy . Here ν is the frequency of\nrotation. The independence of ν from energy has important application\n\nin the design of a cyclotron (see Section 4.4.2).\nThe time taken for one revolution is T= 2π/ω  ≡ 1/ν. If there is a\n\ncomponent of the velocity parallel to the magnetic field (denoted by v\n||\n), it\n\nwill make the particle move along the field and the path of the particle\nwould be a helical one (Fig. 4.6). The distance moved along the magnetic\nfield  in one rotation is called pitch p.  Using Eq. [4.6 (a)], we have\n\np =   v\n||\nT  =  2πm v\n\n||\n / q B [4.6(b)]\n\nThe radius of the circular component of motion is called the radius of\nthe helix.\n\nFIGURE 4.5 Circular motion\n\nFIGURE 4.6 Helical motion\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nMoving Charges and\n\nMagnetism\n\n139\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 4\n\n.3\n\nExample  4.3   What is the radius of the path of an electron (mass\n\n9 × 10\n-31\n\n kg and charge 1.6 × 10\n–19\n\n C) moving at a speed of 3 ×10\n7\n m/s in\n\na magnetic field of 6 × 10\n–4\n\n T perpendicular to it?  What is its\nfrequency?  Calculate its energy in  keV. ( 1 eV = 1.6 × 10\n\n–19\n J).\n\nSolution Using Eq.

The appearance of dancing green pink lights is fascinating, and equally\npuzzling. An explanation of this natural phenomenon is now found in physics, in terms\nof what we have studied here.\n\nConsider a charged particle of  mass m and charge q, entering a region of magnetic\nfield B with an initial velocity v. Let this velocity have a component v\n\np\n parallel to the\n\nmagnetic field and a component v\nn\n normal to it. There is no force on a charged particle in\n\nthe direction of the field. Hence the particle continues to travel with the velocity v\np\n parallel\n\nto the field. The normal component v\nn\n of the particle results in a Lorentz force (v\n\nn\n × B)\n\nwhich is perpendicular to both v\nn\n and B. As seen in Section 4.3.1 the particle thus has a\n\ntendency to perform a circular motion in a plane perpendicular to the magnetic field.\nWhen this is coupled with the velocity parallel to the field, the resulting trajectory will be\na helix along the magnetic field line, as shown in Figure (a) here. Even if the field line\nbends, the helically moving particle is trapped and guided to move around the field line.\nSince the Lorentz force is normal to the velocity of each point, the field does no work on\nthe particle and the magnitude of velocity remains the same.\n\nDuring a solar flare, a large number of electrons and protons are ejected from the sun.\nSome of them get trapped in the earth’s magnetic field and move in helical paths along the\nfield lines. The field lines come closer to each other near the magnetic poles; see figure (b).\nHence the density of charges increases near the poles. These particles collide with atoms\nand molecules of the atmosphere. Excited oxygen atoms emit green light and excited\nnitrogen atoms emits pink light. This phenomenon is called Aurora Borealis in physics.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n140\n\n4.4 MOTION IN COMBINED ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC\nFIELDS\n\n4.4.1  Velocity selector\n\nYou know that a charge q moving with velocity v in presence of both\nelectric and magnetic fields experiences a force given by Eq. (4.3), that is,\n\nF = q (E + v × B) = F\nE\n + F\n\nB\n\nWe shall consider the simple case in which electric and magnetic\nfields are perpendicular to each other and also perpendicular to\nthe velocity of the particle, as shown in Fig. 4.7. We have,\n\nˆ ˆ ˆ, ,\uf03d \uf03d \uf03dE j B k v iE B v\n\n( )ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ, , –= = = = =F E j F v × B i × k jE Bq qE q q v B qvB\nTherefore, ( ) ˆ–q E vB=F j .\n\nThus, electric and magnetic forces are in opposite directions as\nshown in the figure. Suppose, we adjust the value of E and B such\nthat magnitudes of the two forces are equal. Then, total force on\nthe charge is zero and the charge will move in the fields undeflected.\nThis happens when,\n\nor\nE\n\nqE qvB v\nB\n\n= = (4.7)\n\nThis condition can be used to select charged particles of a particular\nvelocity out of a beam containing charges moving with different speeds\n(irrespective of their charge and mass). The crossed E and B fields, therefore,\nserve as a velocity selector. Only particles with speed E/B pass\nundeflected through the region of crossed fields. This method was\nemployed by J. J. Thomson in 1897 to measure the charge to mass ratio\n(e/m) of an electron. The principle is also employed in Mass Spectrometer –\na device that separates charged particles, usually ions, according to their\ncharge to mass ratio.\n\n4.4.2  Cyclotron\n\nThe cyclotron is a machine to accelerate charged particles or ions to high\nenergies. It was invented by E.O. Lawrence and M.S. Livingston in 1934\nto investigate nuclear structure. The cyclotron uses both electric and\nmagnetic fields in combination to increase the energy of charged particles.\nAs the fields are perpendicular to each other they are called crossed\nfields. Cyclotron uses the fact that the frequency of revolution of the\ncharged particle in a magnetic field is independent of its energy. The\nparticles move most of the time inside two semicircular disc-like metal\ncontainers, D\n\n1\n and D\n\n2\n, which are called dees as they look like the letter\n\nD. Figure 4.8 shows a schematic view of the cyclotron.  Inside the metal\nboxes the particle is shielded and is not acted on by the electric field. The\nmagnetic field, however, acts on the particle and makes it go round in a\ncircular path inside a dee. Every time the particle moves from one dee to\nanother it is acted upon by the electric field. The sign of the electric field\nis changed alternately in tune with the circular motion of the particle.\nThis ensures that the particle is always accelerated by the electric field.\nEach time the acceleration increases the energy of the particle. As energy\n\nFIGURE 4.7\n\nC\ny\nc\nlo\n\ntr\no\n\nn\n\nIn\nte\n\nra\nc\nti\n\nv\ne\n \nd\n\ne\nm\n\no\nn\n\ns\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n:\n\nh\ntt\np\n:/\n/w\n\nw\nw\n\n.p\nh\ny\n.n\n\ntn\nu\n.e\n\nd\nu\n.t\nw\n\n/n\ntn\n\nu\nja\n\nv\na\n/i\nn\nd\ne\nx\n.p\n\nh\np\n?t\n\no\np\nic\n\n=\n3\n3\n.0\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nMoving Charges and\n\nMagnetism\n\n141\n\nincreases, the radius of the circular path increases. So the path is a\nspiral one.\n\nThe whole assembly is evacuated to minimise collisions between the\nions and the air molecules. A high frequency alternating voltage is applied\nto the dees. In the sketch shown in Fig. 4.8, positive ions or positively\n\ncharged particles (e.g., protons) are released at the centre P. They move\nin a semi-circular path in one of the dees and arrive in the gap between\nthe dees in a time interval T/2; where T, the period of revolution, is given\n\nby Eq. (4.6),\n\n \n1 2\n\nc\n\nm\nT\n\nqBν\n\nπ\n= =\n\nor \n2\n\nc\n\nqB\n\nm\nν =\n\nπ\n(4.8)\n\nThis frequency is called the cyclotron frequency for obvious reasons\nand is denoted by ν\n\nc \n.\n\nThe frequency ν\na\n of the applied voltage is adjusted so that the polarity\n\nof the dees is reversed in the same time that it takes the ions to complete\n\none half of the revolution. The requirement ν\na\n = ν\n\nc\n is called the resonance\n\ncondition. The phase of the supply is adjusted so that when the positive\n\nions arrive at the edge of D\n1\n, D\n\n2\n is at a lower\n\npotential and the ions are accelerated across the\n\ngap. Inside the dees the particles travel in a region\n\nfree of the electric field. The increase in their\n\nkinetic energy is qV each time they cross from\n\none dee to another (V refers to the voltage across\n\nthe dees at that time). From Eq. (4.5), it is clear\n\nthat the radius of their path goes on increasing\n\neach time their kinetic energy increases. The ions\n\nare repeatedly accelerated across the dees until\n\nthey have the required energy to have a radius\n\napproximately that of the dees. They are then\n\ndeflected by a magnetic field and leave the system\n\nvia an exit slit. From Eq. (4.5) we have,\n\nqBR\nv\n\nm\n= (4.9)\n\nwhere R is the radius of the trajectory at exit, and\n\nequals the radius of a dee.\nHence, the kinetic energy of the ions is,\n\n2 2 2\n21\n\n2 2\n\nq B R\nm\n\nm\n=v (4.10)\n\nThe operation of the cyclotron is based on the\nfact that the time for one revolution of an ion is\nindependent of its speed or radius of its orbit.\n\nThe cyclotron is used to bombard nuclei with\nenergetic particles, so accelerated by it, and study\n\nFIGURE 4.8 A schematic sketch of the\n\ncyclotron. There is a source of charged\nparticles or ions at P which move in a\n\ncircular fashion in the dees, D\n1\n and D\n\n2\n, on\n\naccount of a uniform perpendicular\nmagnetic field B. An alternating voltage\nsource accelerates these ions to high\n\nspeeds.

The vision of\nDr. Meghnath Saha created a 37" Cyclotron in the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics in\nKolkata in 1953. This was soon followed by a series of  Cockroft-Walton  type of accelerators\nestablished in Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Mumbai, Aligarh Muslim\nUniversity (AMU), Aligarh, Bose Institute, Kolkata and Andhra University, Waltair.\n\nThe sixties saw the commissioning of a number of Van de Graaff accelerators: a 5.5 MV\nterminal machine in Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), Mumbai (1963); a 2 MV terminal\nmachine in Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur; a 400 kV terminal machine in Banaras\nHindu University (BHU), Varanasi; and Punjabi University, Patiala. One 66 cm Cyclotron\ndonated by the Rochester University of USA was commissioned in Panjab University,\nChandigarh. A small  electron accelerator was also established in University of Pune, Pune.\n\nIn a major initiative taken in the seventies  and eighties, a Variable Energy Cyclotron was\nbuilt indigenously in Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre (VECC), Kolkata; 2 MV Tandem Van\nde Graaff accelerator was developed and built in BARC and a 14 MV Tandem Pelletron\naccelerator  was installed in TIFR.\n\nThis was soon followed by a 15 MV Tandem Pelletron established by University Grants\nCommission (UGC), as an inter-university facility in Inter-University Accelerator Centre\n(IUAC), New Delhi; a 3 MV Tandem Pelletron in Institute of Physics, Bhubaneswar; and two\n1.7 MV Tandetrons in Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research, Hyderabad\nand Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research, Kalpakkam. Both TIFR and IUAC  are\naugmenting their facilities with the addition of superconducting LINAC modules to accelerate\nthe ions to higher energies.\n\nBesides these ion accelerators, the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) has developed\nmany electron accelerators. A 2 GeV Synchrotron Radiation Source is being built in Raja\nRamanna Centre for Advanced Technologies, Indore.\n\nThe Department of Atomic Energy is considering Accelerator Driven Systems (ADS) for\npower production and fissile material breeding as future options.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nMoving Charges and\n\nMagnetism\n\n143\n\n4.5 MAGNETIC FIELD DUE TO A CURRENT ELEMENT,\nBIOT-SAVART LAW\n\nAll magnetic fields that we know are due to currents (or moving charges)\n\nand due to intrinsic magnetic moments of particles. Here, we\nshall study the relation between current and the magnetic field\nit produces. It is given by the Biot-Savart’s  law. Figure 4.9 shows\n\na finite conductor XY carrying current I. Consider an infinitesimal\nelement dl of the conductor. The magnetic field dB due to this\nelement is to be determined at a point P which is at a distance r\n\nfrom it. Let θ be the angle between dl and the displacement vector\nr. According to Biot-Savart’s law, the magnitude of the magnetic\nfield dB is proportional to the current I, the element length |dl|,\n\nand inversely proportional to the square of the distance r. Its\ndirection* is perpendicular to the plane containing dl and r .\nThus, in vector notation,\n\n3\n\nI d\nd\n\nr\n\n×\n∝\n\nr\nB\n\nl\n\n           \n0\n\n3\n4\n\nI d\n\nr\n\nµ ×\n=\n\nπ\n\nrl\n [4.11(a)]\n\nwhere µ\n0\n/4π is a constant of proportionality.

Some\nof these are:\n(i) Both are long range, since both depend inversely on the square of\n\ndistance from the source to the point of interest. The principle of\nsuperposition applies to both fields. [In this connection, note that\nthe magnetic field is linear in the source I dl just as the electrostatic\n\nfield is linear in its source: the electric charge.]\n(ii) The  electrostatic field is produced by a scalar source, namely, the\n\nelectric charge. The magnetic field is produced by a vector source\n\nI dl.\n\n* The sense of  dl × r is also given by the Right Hand Screw rule : Look at the\nplane containing vectors dl and r.

In Fig. 4.9, the magnetic field at any\npoint in  the direction of dl (the dashed line) is zero. Along this line,\nθ = 0, sin θ = 0 and from Eq. [4.11(a)], |dB| = 0.\n\nThere is an interesting  relation between ε\n0\n, the permittivity of free\n\nspace; µ\n0\n, the permeability of free space; and c, the speed of light in\n\nvacuum:\n\n( ) 00 0 04\n4\n\nµ\nε µ ε\n\n  \n= π\n\n  \n  π\n\n ( )79\n1\n\n10\n9 10\n\n−  \n=   \n\n  ×\n8 2 2\n\n1 1\n\n(3 10 ) c\n= =\n\n×\n\nWe will discuss this connection further in Chapter 8 on the\n\nelectromagnetic waves.

The evaluation entails summing up the effect of infinitesimal\ncurrent elements (I dl) mentioned in the previous section.\n\nWe assume that the current I is steady and that the\nevaluation is carried out in free space (i.e., vacuum).\n\nFigure 4.11 depicts a circular loop carrying a steady\n\ncurrent I. The loop is placed in the y-z plane with its\ncentre at the origin O and has a radius R. The x-axis is\nthe axis of the loop. We wish to calculate the magnetic\n\nfield at the point P on this axis. Let x be the distance of\nP from the centre O of the loop.\n\nConsider a conducting element dl of the loop. This is\n\nshown in Fig. 4.11. The magnitude dB of the magnetic\nfield due to dl is given by the Biot-Savart law [Eq. 4.11(a)],\n\n0\n\n3\n4\n\n=\n× rI d\n\ndB\nr\n\nµ\n\nπ\n\nl\n(4.12)\n\nNow r\n2\n = x\n\n2\n + R\n\n2\n . Further, any element of the loop\n\nwill be perpendicular to the displacement vector from\nthe element to the axial point. For example, the element\n\ndl in Fig. 4.11 is in the y-z plane, whereas, the\ndisplacement vector r from dl to the axial point P is in\nthe x-y plane. Hence |dl × r|=r dl. Thus,\n\n ( )π\n0\n\n2 2\n\nd\nd\n\n4\n\nI l\nB\n\nx R\n\nµ\n=\n\n+ (4.13)\n\nThe direction of dB is shown in Fig. 4.11. It is perpendicular to the\n\nplane formed by dl and r. It has an x-component dB\nx\n and a component\n\nperpendicular to x-axis, dB\n⊥\n. When the components perpendicular to\n\nthe x-axis are summed over, they cancel out and we obtain a null result.\n\nFor example, the dB\n⊥\n component due to dl is cancelled by the contribution\n\ndue to the diametrically opposite dl element, shown in\nFig. 4.11. Thus, only the x-component survives. The net contribution\n\nalong x-direction can be obtained by integrating dB\nx\n  = dB cos θ over the\n\nloop.

The direction of the magnetic field is given by\n(another) right-hand thumb rule stated below:\n\nCurl the palm of your right hand around the circular wire with the\n\nfingers pointing in the direction of the current. The right-hand thumb\n\ngives the direction of the magnetic field.\n\nExample 4.6 A straight wire carrying a current of 12 A is bent into a\nsemi-circular arc of radius 2.0 cm as shown in Fig. 4.13(a).

All such contributions\nadd up in magnitude. Hence direction of B for a semicircular arc\nis given by the right-hand rule and magnitude is half that of a\n\ncircular loop.

Ampere’s circuital law considers an open surface with\n\na boundary (Fig. 4.14). The surface has current passing through\n\nit. We consider the boundary to be made up of a number of small\n\nline elements. Consider one such element of length dl. We take\n\nthe value of the tangential component of the magnetic field, B\nt\n,\n \nat\n\nthis element and multiply it by the length of that element dl [Note:\n\nB\nt\ndl=B.d l]. All such products are added together. We consider\n\nthe limit as the lengths of elements get smaller and their number\n\ngets larger. The sum then tends to an integral. Ampere’s   law\n\nstates that this integral is  equal to µ\n0\n times the total current\n\npassing through  the surface,  i.e.,\n\n“B.dl.d Il = µ0 [4.17(a)]\nwhere I  is the total current through the surface. The integral is taken\n\nover the closed loop coinciding with the boundary C of the surface. The\n\nrelation above involves a sign-convention, given by the right-hand rule.\n\nLet the fingers of the right-hand be curled in the sense the boundary is\n\ntraversed in the loop integral “B.dl. Then the direction of the thumb\ngives the sense in which the current I  is regarded as positive.\n\nFor several applications, a much simplified version of Eq. [4.17(a)]\n\nproves sufficient. We shall assume that, in such cases, it is possible to\n\nchoose the loop (called an amperian loop) such that at each point of the\n\nloop, either\n\nFIGURE 4.14\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 4\n\n.7\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n148\n\n(i) B is tangential to the loop and is a non-zero constant\nB, or\n\n(ii) B is normal to the loop, or\n\n(iii) B vanishes.\nNow, let L be the length (part) of the  loop for which B\n\nis tangential. Let I\ne\n  be the current enclosed by the loop.\n\nThen, Eq. (4.17) reduces to,\n\nBL =µ\n0\nI\ne\n\n[4.17(b)]\n\nWhen there is a system with a symmetry such as for\n\na straight infinite current-carrying wire in Fig. 4.15, the\nAmpere’s law enables an easy evaluation of the magnetic\nfield, much the same way Gauss’ law helps in\n\ndetermination of the electric field. This is exhibited in the\nExample 4.9 below. The boundary of the loop chosen is\na circle and magnetic field is tangential to the\n\ncircumference of the circle. The law gives, for the left hand\nside of Eq. [4.17 (b)], B. 2πr. We find that the magnetic\nfield at a distance r outside the wire is tangential and\n\ngiven by\n\nB × 2πr  =  µ\n0 \nI,\n\nB = µ\n0 \n I/ (2πr) (4.18)\n\nThe above result for the infinite wire  is interesting\nfrom several points of view.\n\n(i) It implies that the field at every point on a circle of\nradius r, (with the wire along the axis), is same in\nmagnitude. In other words, the magnetic field\n\npossesses what is called a cylindrical symmetry. The\nfield that normally can depend on three coordinates\ndepends only on one: r. Whenever there is symmetry,\n\nthe solutions simplify.\n(ii) The field direction at any point on this circle is\n\ntangential to it. Thus, the lines of constant magnitude\n\nof magnetic field form concentric circles. Notice now,\n\nin Fig. 4.1(c), the iron filings form concentric circles.\nThese lines called magnetic field lines form closed\n\nloops. This is unlike the electrostatic field lines which\n\noriginate from positive charges and end at negative\n\ncharges. The expression for the magnetic field of a\nstraight wire provides a theoretical justification to\n\nOersted’s experiments.\n\n(iii) Another interesting point to note is that even though\n\nthe wire is infinite, the field due to it at a non-zero\ndistance is not infinite. It tends to blow up only when\n\nwe come very close to the wire. The field is directly\n\nproportional to the current and inversely proportional\n\nto the distance from the (infinitely long) current\nsource.\n\nA\nN\n\nD\nR\n\nE\n A\n\nM\nP\nE\n\nR\nE\n\n (\n1\n7\n7\n5\n –\n\n1\n8\n3\n6\n)\n\nAndre Ampere (1775 –\n\n1836) Andre Marie Ampere\nwas a French physicist,\nmathematician and chemist\n\nwho founded the science of\nelectrodynamics. Ampere\nwas a child prodigy\n\nwho mastered advanced\nmathematics by the age of\n12. Ampere grasped the\n\nsignificance of Oersted’s\ndiscovery. He carried out a\nlarge series of experiments\n\nto explore the relationship\nbetween current electricity\nand magnetism. These\n\ninvestigations culminated\nin 1827 with the\npublication of the\n\n‘Mathematical Theory of\nElectrodynamic Pheno-\nmena Deduced Solely from\n\nExperiments’. He hypo-\nthesised that all magnetic\nphenomena are due to\n\ncirculating electric\ncurrents. Ampere was\nhumble and absent-\n\nminded. He once forgot an\ninvitation to dine with the\nEmperor Napoleon. He died\n\nof pneumonia at the age of\n61. His gravestone bears\nthe epitaph: Tandem Felix\n\n(Happy at last).\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nMoving Charges and\n\nMagnetism\n\n149\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 4\n\n.8\n\n(iv) There exists a simple rule to determine the direction of the magnetic\nfield due to a long wire. This rule, called the right-hand rule*, is:\n\nGrasp the wire in your right hand with your extended thumb pointing\n\nin the direction of the current. Your fingers will curl around in the\n\ndirection of the magnetic field.\n\nAmpere’s circuital law is not new in content from Biot-Savart law.\nBoth relate the magnetic field and the current, and both express the same\nphysical consequences of a steady electrical current. Ampere’s law is to\n\nBiot-Savart law, what Gauss’s law is to Coulomb’s law. Both, Ampere’s\nand Gauss’s law relate a physical quantity on the periphery or boundary\n(magnetic or electric field) to another physical quantity, namely, the source,\n\nin the interior (current or charge). We also note that Ampere’s circuital\nlaw holds for steady currents which do not fluctuate with time. The\nfollowing example will help us understand what is meant by the term\n\nenclosed current.\n\nExample 4.8 Figure 4.15 shows a long straight wire of a circular\ncross-section (radius a) carrying steady current I. The current I is\n\nuniformly distributed across this cross-section. Calculate the\nmagnetic field in the region r < a and r > a.\n\nFIGURE 4.15\n\nSolution (a) Consider the case r > a .

The direction of the field is tangential to\n\nthe respective circular loop (1 or 2) and given by the right-hand\n\nrule described earlier in this section.\n\nThis example possesses the required symmetry so that Ampere’s\n\nlaw can be applied readily.\n\nIt should be noted that while Ampere’s circuital law holds for any\n\nloop, it may not always facilitate an evaluation of the magnetic field in\n\nevery case. For example, for the case of the circular loop discussed in\n\nSection 4.6, it cannot be applied to extract the simple expression\n\nB = µ\n0\nI/2R [Eq. (4.16)] for the field at the centre of the loop. However,\n\nthere exists a large number of situations of high symmetry where the law\n\ncan be conveniently applied. We shall use  it in the next section to calculate\n\nthe magnetic field produced by two commonly used and very useful\n\nmagnetic systems: the solenoid and the toroid.\n\n4.8  THE SOLENOID AND THE TOROID\nThe solenoid and the toroid are two pieces of equipment which generate\n\nmagnetic fields. The synchrotron uses a combination of both to generate\n\nthe high magnetic fields required. In both, solenoid and toroid, we come\n\nacross a situation of high symmetry where Ampere’s law can be\n\nconveniently  applied.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nMoving Charges and\n\nMagnetism\n\n151\n\n4.8.1  The solenoid\n\nWe shall discuss a long solenoid. By long solenoid we mean that the\nsolenoid’s length is large compared to its radius. It consists of a long\nwire wound in the form of a helix where the neighbouring turns are closely\n\nspaced. So each turn can be regarded as a circular loop.  The net magnetic\nfield is the vector sum of the fields due to all the turns. Enamelled wires\nare used for winding so that turns are insulated from each other.\n\nFigure 4.17 displays the magnetic field lines for a finite solenoid. We\nshow a section of this solenoid in an enlarged manner in Fig. 4.17(a).\nFigure 4.17(b) shows the entire finite solenoid with its magnetic field. In\nFig. 4.17(a), it is clear from the circular loops that the field  between two\nneighbouring turns vanishes. In Fig. 4.17(b), we see that the field at the\ninterior mid-point P is uniform, strong and along the axis of the solenoid.\nThe field at the exterior mid-point Q is weak and moreover is along the\naxis of the solenoid with no perpendicular or normal component. As the\nsolenoid is made longer it appears like a long cylindrical metal sheet.\nFigure 4.18 represents this idealised picture. The field outside the solenoid\napproaches zero. We shall assume that the field outside is zero. The field\ninside becomes everywhere parallel to the axis.\n\nFIGURE 4.17 (a) The magnetic field due to a section of the solenoid which has been\nstretched out for clarity. Only the exterior semi-circular part is shown. Notice\n\nhow the circular loops between neighbouring turns tend to cancel.\n(b) The magnetic field of a finite solenoid.\n\nFIGURE 4.18 The magnetic field of a very long solenoid. We consider a\nrectangular Amperian loop abcd to determine the field.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n152\n\nConsider a rectangular Amperian loop abcd. Along cd the field is zero\nas argued above. Along transverse sections bc and ad, the field component\n\nis zero. Thus, these two sections  make no contribution. Let the field along\nab be B. Thus, the relevant length of the Amperian loop is, L = h.\n\nLet n be the number of turns per unit length, then the total number\n\nof turns is  nh. The enclosed current is,  I\ne\n\n = I (n h), where I is the current\nin the solenoid. From Ampere’s circuital law [Eq. 4.17 (b)]\n\nBL =  µ\n0\nI\ne\n,    B h = µ\n\n0\nI (n h)\n\nB = µ\n0\n n I (4.20)\n\nThe direction of the field is given by the right-hand rule. The solenoid\nis commonly used to obtain a uniform magnetic field. We shall see in the\n\nnext chapter that a large field is possible by inserting a soft\n\niron core inside the solenoid.\n\n4.8.2  The toroid\n\nThe toroid is a hollow circular ring on which a large number\nof turns of a wire are closely wound.  It can be viewed as a\nsolenoid which has been bent into a circular shape to close\n\non itself. It is shown in Fig. 4.19(a) carrying a current I.   We\nshall see that the magnetic field in the open space inside\n(point P) and exterior to the toroid (point Q) is zero. The\n\nfield B inside the toroid is constant in magnitude for the\nideal toroid of closely wound turns.\n\nFigure 4.19(b) shows a sectional view of the toroid. The\n\ndirection of the magnetic field inside is clockwise as per the\nright-hand thumb rule for circular loops. Three circular\nAmperian loops 1, 2 and 3 are shown by dashed lines. By\n\nsymmetry, the magnetic field should be tangential to each\nof them and constant in magnitude for a given loop. The\ncircular areas bounded by loops 2 and 3 both cut the toroid:\n\nso that each turn of current carrying wire is cut once by\nthe loop 2 and twice by the loop 3.\n\nLet the magnetic field along loop 1 be B\n1\n in magnitude.\n\nThen in Ampere’s circuital law [Eq. 4.17(a)], L = 2π r\n1\n.\n\nHowever, the loop encloses no current, so I\ne\n = 0. Thus,\n\nB\n1\n (2 π r\n\n1\n) = µ\n\n0\n(0),    B\n\n1\n = 0\n\nThus, the magnetic field at any point P in the open space\ninside the toroid is zero.\n\nWe shall now show that magnetic field at Q is likewise\n\nzero. Let the magnetic field along loop 3 be B\n3\n. Once again\n\nfrom Ampere’s law L = 2 π r\n3\n. However, from the sectional\n\ncut, we see that the current coming out of the plane of the\n\npaper is cancelled exactly by the current going into it. Thus,\nI\ne\n= 0, and B\n\n3\n = 0. Let the magnetic field inside the solenoid\n\nbe B. We shall now consider the magnetic field at S. Once again we employ\n\nAmpere’s law in the form of Eq. [4.17 (a)].

We\n\nre-express Eq. (4.21) to make the comparison easier with the solenoid\nresult given in Eq. (4.20). Let r be the average radius of the toroid and n\nbe the number of turns per unit length. Then\n\nN = 2πr n  = (average) perimeter of the toroid\n\n                    × number of turns per unit length\n\nand thus,\n\nB = µ\n0\n n I, (4.22)\n\ni.e., the result for the solenoid!\nIn an ideal toroid the coils are circular. In reality the turns of the\n\ntoroidal coil form a helix and there is always a small magnetic field external\nto the toroid.\n\nMAGNETIC CONFINEMENT\n\nWe have seen in Section 4.3 (see also the box on helical motion of charged particles earlier\nin this chapter) that orbits of charged particles are helical. If the magnetic field is\nnon-uniform, but does not change much during one circular orbit, then the radius of the\nhelix will decrease as it enters stronger magnetic field  and the radius will increase when it\nenters weaker  magnetic fields. We consider two solenoids at a distance from each other,\nenclosed in an evacuated container (see figure below where we have not shown the container).\nCharged particles moving in the region between the two solenoids will start with a small\nradius. The radius  will increase as field decreases and the radius will decrease again as\nfield due to the second solenoid takes over.  The solenoids act as a mirror or reflector. [See\nthe direction of F as the particle approaches coil 2 in the figure. It has a horizontal component\nagainst the forward motion.] This makes the particles turn back when they approach the\nsolenoid. Such an arrangement will act like magnetic bottle or magnetic container. The\nparticles will never touch the sides of the container. Such magnetic bottles are of great use\nin confining the high energy plasma in fusion experiments. The plasma will destroy any\nother form of material container because of its high temperature. Another useful container\nis a toroid. Toroids are expected to play a key role in the tokamak, an equipment for plasma\nconfinement in fusion power reactors. There is an international collaboration called the\nInternational Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), being set up in France, for\nachieving controlled fusion, of which India is a collaborating nation.

What is the\n\nmagnitude of the magnetic field inside the solenoid?\n\nSolution  The number of turns per unit length is,\n\n500\n1000\n\n0.5\nn = =  turns/m\n\nThe length l = 0.5 m and radius r = 0.01 m. Thus, l/a = 50 i.e., l >> a .\n\nHence, we can use the long solenoid formula, namely, Eq. (4.20)\nB = µ\n\n0\nn I\n\n   = 4π × 10\n–7\n\n × 10\n3\n × 5\n\n   = 6.28 × 10\n–3\n\n T\n\n4.9 FORCE BETWEEN TWO PARALLEL CURRENTS,\nTHE AMPERE\n\nWe have learnt that there exists a magnetic field due to a conductor\n\ncarrying a current which obeys the Biot-Savart law. Further, we have\n\nlearnt that an external magnetic field will exert a force on\n\na current-carrying conductor. This follows from the\n\nLorentz force formula. Thus, it is logical to expect that\n\ntwo current-carrying conductors placed near each other\n\nwill exert (magnetic) forces on each other. In the period\n\n1820-25, Ampere studied the nature of this magnetic\n\nforce and its dependence on the magnitude of the current,\n\non the shape and size of the conductors, as well as, the\n\ndistances between the conductors. In this section, we\n\nshall take the simple example of two parallel current-\n\ncarrying conductors, which will perhaps help us to\n\nappreciate Ampere’s painstaking work.\n\nFigure 4.20 shows two long parallel conductors a\n\nand b separated by a distance d and carrying (parallel)\n\ncurrents I\na\n and I\n\nb\n, respectively. The conductor ‘a’\n\nproduces,  the same magnetic field B\na\n at all points along\n\nthe conductor ‘b’. The right-hand rule tells us that the\n\ndirection of this field is downwards (when the conductors\n\nare placed horizontally). Its magnitude is given by Eq. [4.19(a)] or from\n\nAmpere’s circuital law,\n\n0\n\n2\na\n\na\n\nI\nB\n\nd\n\nµ\n=\n\nπ\n\nThe conductor ‘b’ carrying a current I\nb\n will experience a sideways\n\nforce due to the  field B\na\n. The direction of this force is towards the\n\nconductor ‘a’ (Verify this). We label this force as F\nba\n\n, the force on a\n\nsegment L of ‘b’ due to ‘a’. The magnitude of this force is given by\n\nEq. (4.4),\n\nFIGURE 4.20 Two long straight\nparallel conductors carrying steady\n\ncurrents I\na\n and I\n\nb\n and separated by a\n\ndistance d. B\na\n is the magnetic field set\n\nup by conductor ‘a’ at conductor ‘b’.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nMoving Charges and\n\nMagnetism\n\n155\n\nF\nba\n\n = I\nb\n L B\n\na\n\n      \n0\n\n2\na bI I L\nd\n\nµ\n=\n\nπ\n(4.23)\n\nIt is of course possible to compute the force on ‘a’ due to ‘b’. From\nconsiderations similar to above we can find the force F\n\nab\n, on a segment of\n\nlength L of ‘a’ due to the current in ‘b’. It  is equal in magnitude to F\nba\n\n,\nand directed towards ‘b’. Thus,\n\nF\nba\n\n = –F\nab\n\n(4.24)\n\nNote that this is consistent with Newton’s third Law. Thus, at least for\n\nparallel conductors and steady currents, we have shown that the\n\nBiot-Savart law and the Lorentz force yield results in accordance with\n\nNewton’s third Law*.\n\nWe have seen from above that currents flowing in the same direction\n\nattract each other. One can show that oppositely directed currents repel\n\neach other. Thus,\n\nParallel currents attract, and antiparallel currents repel.\n\nThis rule is the opposite of what we find in electrostatics. Like (same\n\nsign) charges repel each other, but like (parallel) currents attract each\n\nother.\n\nLet f\nba\n\n represent the magnitude of the force F\nba\n\n per unit length. Then,\n\nfrom Eq. (4.23),\n\nπ\n\n0\n\n2\na b\n\nba\n\nI I\nf\n\nd\n\nµ\n= (4.25)\n\nThe above expression is used to define the ampere (A), which is one\n\nof the seven SI base units.\n\nThe ampere is the value of that steady current which, when maintained\n\nin each of the two very long, straight, parallel conductors of negligible\n\ncross-section, and placed one metre apart in vacuum, would produce\n\non  each of these conductors a force equal to  2 × 10\n–7\n\n newtons per metre\n\nof length.\n\nThis definition of the ampere was adopted in 1946. It is a theoretical\n\ndefinition. In practice, one must eliminate the effect of the earth’s magnetic\n\nfield and substitute very long wires by multiturn coils of appropriate\n\ngeometries. An instrument called the current balance is used to measure\n\nthis mechanical force.\n\nThe SI unit of charge, namely, the coulomb, can now be defined in\n\nterms of the ampere.\n\nWhen a steady current of 1A is set up in a conductor, the quantity of\n\ncharge that flows through its cross-section in 1s is one coulomb (1C).\n\n* It turns out that when we have time-dependent currents and/or charges in\nmotion, Newton’s third law may not hold for forces between charges and/or\n\nconductors. An essential consequence of the Newton’s third law in mechanics\n\nis conservation of momentum of an isolated system. This, however, holds even\n\nfor the case of time-dependent situations with electromagnetic fields, provided\n\nthe momentum carried by fields is also taken into account.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n156  E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 4\n\n.1\n0\n\nExample 4.10 The horizontal component of the earth’s magnetic field\n\nat a certain place is 3.0 ×10\n–5\n\n T and the direction of the field is from\nthe geographic south to the geographic north. A very long straight\nconductor is carrying a steady current of 1A. What is the force per\n\nunit length on it when it is placed on a horizontal table and the\ndirection of the current is (a) east to west; (b) south to north?\n\nSolution  F = Il × B\n\nF = IlB sinθ\nThe force per unit length is\nf = F/l = I B sinθ\n\n(a) When the current is flowing from east to west,\nθ = 90°\nHence,\n\nf = I B\n  = 1 × 3 × 10\n\n–5\n = 3 × 10\n\n–5\n N m\n\n–1\n\nROGET’S SPIRAL FOR ATTRACTION BETWEEN PARALLEL CURRENTS\n\nMagnetic effects are generally smaller than electric effects. As a consequence, the force\nbetween currents is rather small, because of the smallness of the factor µ. Hence it is\ndifficult to demonstrate attraction or repulsion between currents. Thus, for 5 A current\n\nin each wire at a separation of 1cm, the force per metre would be 5 × 10\n–4\n\n N, which is\nabout 50 mg weight. It would be like pulling a wire by a string going over a pulley to\nwhich a 50 mg weight is attached. The displacement of the wire would be quite\n\nunnoticeable.\nWith the use of a soft spring, we can increase the effective length of the parallel current\n\nand by using mercury, we can make the displacement of even a few mm observable very\n\ndramatically. You will also need a constant-current\nsupply giving a constant current of about 5 A.\n\nTake a soft spring whose natural period of\n\noscillations is about 0.5 – 1s. Hang it vertically and\nattach a pointed tip to its lower end, as shown in the\nfigure here. Take some mercury in a dish and adjust the\n\nspring such that the tip is just above the mercury\nsurface. Take the DC current source, connect one of its\nterminals to the upper end of the spring, and dip the\n\nother terminal in mercury. If the tip of the spring touches\nmercury, the circuit is completed through mercury.\n\nLet the DC source be put off to begin with. Let the tip be adjusted so that it just\n\ntouches the mercury surface. Switch on the constant current supply, and watch the\nfascinating outcome. The spring shrinks with a jerk, the tip comes out of mercury (just\nby a mm or so), the circuit is broken, the current stops, the spring relaxes and tries to\n\ncome back to its original position, the tip again touches mercury establishing a current\nin the circuit, and the cycle continues with tick, tick, tick,... In the beginning, you may\nrequire some small adjustments to get a good effect.\n\nKeep your face away from mercury vapour as it is poisonous. Do not inhale mercury\nvapour for long.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nMoving Charges and\n\nMagnetism\n\n157\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 4\n\n.1\n0\n\nThis is larger than the value 2×10\n–7\n\n Nm\n–1\n\n quoted in the definition\nof the ampere. Hence it is important to eliminate the effect of the\n\nearth’s magnetic field and other stray fields while standardising\nthe ampere.\nThe direction of the force is downwards. This direction may be\n\nobtained by the directional property of cross product of vectors.\n(b) When the current is flowing from south to north,\n\nθ = 0\no\n\nf = 0\nHence there is no force on the conductor.\n\n4.10  TORQUE ON CURRENT LOOP, MAGNETIC DIPOLE\n\n4.10.1 Torque on a rectangular current loop in a uniform\nmagnetic field\n\nWe now show that a rectangular loop carrying a steady current I and\n\nplaced in a uniform magnetic field experiences a torque. It does not\nexperience a net force. This behaviour is analogous to\n\nthat of electric dipole in a uniform electric field\n\n(Section 1.12).\n\nWe first consider the simple case when the\nrectangular loop is placed such that the uniform\n\nmagnetic field B is in the plane of the loop. This is\n\nillustrated in Fig. 4.21(a).\nThe field exerts no force on the two arms AD and BC\n\nof the loop. It is perpendicular to the arm AB of the loop\n\nand exerts a force F\n1\n on it which is directed into the\n\nplane of the loop. Its magnitude is,\n\nF\n1\n = I b B\n\nSimilarly, it exerts a force F\n2\n on the arm CD and F\n\n2\n\nis directed out of the plane of the paper.\n\nF\n2\n = I b B = F\n\n1\n\nThus, the net force on the loop is zero. There is a\n\ntorque on the loop due to the pair of forces F\n1\n and F\n\n2\n.\n\nFigure 4.21(b) shows a view of the loop from the AD\n\nend. It shows that the torque on the loop tends to rotate\nit anticlockwise. This torque is (in magnitude),\n\n1 2\n2 2\n\na a\nF Fτ = +\n\n( )\n2 2\n\na a\nIbB IbB I ab B= + =\n\n    = I A B (4.26)\n\nwhere A = ab is the area of the rectangle.\n\nWe next consider the case when the plane of the loop,\n\nis not along the magnetic field, but makes an angle with\nit. We take the angle between the field and the normal to\n\nFIGURE 4.21 (a) A rectangular\ncurrent-carrying coil in uniform\n\nmagnetic field. The magnetic moment\n\nm points downwards. The torque τττττ is\nalong the axis and tends to rotate the\n\ncoil anticlockwise.

Figure 4.22 illustrates\n\nthis general case.\nThe forces on the arms BC and DA are equal,\n\nopposite, and act along the axis of the coil, which\n\nconnects the centres of mass of BC and DA. Being\ncollinear along the axis they cancel each other,\nresulting in no net force or torque. The forces on\n\narms AB and CD are F\n1\n and F\n\n2\n. They too are equal\n\nand opposite, with magnitude,\n\nF\n1\n = F\n\n2\n = I b B\n\nBut they are not collinear!  This results in a\ncouple as before. The torque is, however, less than\nthe earlier case when plane of loop was along the\n\nmagnetic field. This is because the perpendicular\ndistance between the forces of the couple has\ndecreased. Figure 4.22(b) is a view of the\n\narrangement from the AD end and it illustrates\nthese two forces constituting a couple. The\nmagnitude of the torque on the loop is,\n\n1 2sin sin\n2 2\n\na a\nF Fτ θ θ= +\n\n= I ab B sin θ\n\n   = I A B sin θ (4.27)\n\nAs θ à 0, the perpendicular distance between\n\nthe forces of the couple also approaches zero. This\nmakes the forces collinear and the net force and\ntorque zero. The torques in Eqs. (4.26) and (4.27)\n\ncan be expressed as vector product of the magnetic moment of the coil\nand the magnetic field. We define the magnetic moment of the current\nloop as,\n\nm = I A (4.28)\n\nwhere the direction of the area vector A is given by the right-hand thumb\n\nrule and is directed into the plane of the paper in Fig. 4.21. Then as the\nangle between m and B is θ ,  Eqs. (4.26) and (4.27) can be expressed by\none expression\n\n(4.29)\n\nThis  is analogous to the electrostatic case (Electric dipole of dipole\nmoment p\n\ne\n in an electric field E).\n\nττ ××= p Ee\n\nAs is clear from Eq. (4.28), the dimensions of the magnetic moment are\n[A][L\n\n2\n] and its unit is Am\n\n2\n.\n\nFrom Eq. (4.29), we see that the torque τττττ vanishes when m is either\n\nparallel or antiparallel to the magnetic field B. This indicates a state of\nequilibrium as there is no torque on the coil (this also applies to any\nobject with a magnetic moment m). When m and B are parallel the\n\nFIGURE 4.22 (a) The area vector of the loop\nABCD makes an arbitrary angle θ with\n\nthe magnetic field. (b) Top view of\n\nthe loop.

Any small rotation of the coil produces a\ntorque which brings it back to its original position. When they are\n\nantiparallel, the equilibrium is unstable as any rotation produces a torque\nwhich increases with the amount of rotation. The presence of this torque\nis also the reason why a small magnet or any magnetic dipole aligns\n\nitself with the external magnetic field.\nIf the loop has N closely wound turns, the expression for torque, Eq.\n\n(4.29), still holds, with\n\nm = N I A (4.30)\n\nExample 4.11 A 100 turn closely wound circular coil of radius 10 cm\ncarries a current of 3.2 A. (a) What is the field at the centre of the\ncoil? (b) What is the magnetic moment of this coil?\n\nThe coil is placed in a vertical plane and is free to rotate about a\nhorizontal axis which coincides with its diameter. A uniform magnetic\nfield of 2T in the horizontal direction exists such that initially the\n\naxis of the coil is in the direction of the field. The coil rotates through\nan angle of 90° under the influence of the magnetic field.\n(c) What are the magnitudes of the torques on the coil in the initial\n\nand final position?  (d) What is the angular speed acquired by the\ncoil when it has rotated by 90°? The moment of inertia of the coil is\n0.1 kg m\n\n2\n.\n\nSolution\n(a) From Eq.

If the loop is free to turn, what is its orientation\nof stable equilibrium? Show that in this orientation, the flux of\n\nthe total field (external field + field produced by the loop) is\nmaximum.\n\n (c) A loop of irregular shape carrying current is located in an external\n\nmagnetic field. If the wire is flexible, why does it change to a\ncircular shape?\n\nSolution\n\n(a) No, because that would require τττττ to be in the vertical direction.\nBut τττττ = I A × B, and since A of the horizontal loop is in the vertical\ndirection, τ would be in the plane of the loop for any B.\n\n(b) Orientation of stable equilibrium is one where the area vector A\nof the loop is in the direction of external magnetic field. In this\norientation, the magnetic field produced by the loop is in the same\n\ndirection as external field, both normal to the  plane of the loop,\nthus giving rise to maximum flux of the total field.\n\n(c) It assumes circular shape with its plane normal to the field to\n\nmaximise flux, since for a given perimeter, a circle encloses greater\n\narea than any other shape.\n\n4.10.2  Circular current loop as a magnetic dipole\n\nIn this section, we shall consider the elementary magnetic element: the\ncurrent loop. We shall show that the magnetic field (at large distances)\n\ndue to current in a circular current loop is very similar in behaviour to\nthe electric field of an electric dipole. In Section 4.6, we have evaluated\nthe magnetic field on the axis of a circular loop, of a radius R, carrying a\n\nsteady current I. The magnitude of this field is [(Eq. (4.15)],\n\n( )\n\n2\n0\n\n3/2\n2 22\n\nµ\n=\n\n+\n\nI R\nB\n\nx R\n\nand its direction is along the axis and given by the right-hand thumb\nrule (Fig. 4.12). Here, x is the distance along the axis from the centre of\n\nthe loop. For x >> R, we may drop the R\n2\n term in the denominator. Thus,\n\nIntegrating from θ = 0 to θ = π/2,\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nMoving Charges and\n\nMagnetism\n\n161\n\n2\n0\n\n3\n2\n\nIR\nB\n\nx\n\nµ\n=\n\nNote that the area of the loop A = πR\n2\n.

[4.31(a)] is very similar to an expression obtained\nearlier for the electric field of a dipole. The similarity may be seen if we\nsubstitute,\n\n 0 01/µ ε→\n\ne→m p  (electrostatic dipole)\n\n →B E   (electrostatic field)\n\nWe then obtain,\n\n3\n0\n\n2\n\n4\ne\n\nxε\n=\n\nπ\n\np\nE\n\nwhich is precisely the field for an electric dipole at a point on its axis.\nconsidered in Chapter 1, Section 1.10 [Eq. (1.20)].\n\nIt can be shown that the above analogy can be carried further. We\nhad found in Chapter 1 that the electric field on the perpendicular bisector\nof the dipole is given by [See Eq.(1.21)],\n\nE ;\np\n\ne\n\nx4\n0\n\n3\nπε\n\nwhere x is the distance from the dipole. If we replace p à m and 0 01/µ ε→\n\nin the above expression, we obtain the result for B for a point in the\nplane of the loop at a distance x  from the centre. For  x >>R,\n\nB\nm\n\n;\nµ\n\n0\n\n3\n4π x\n\nx R; >> [4.31(b)]\n\nThe results given by Eqs. [4.31(a)] and [4.31(b)] become exact for a\n\npoint magnetic dipole.\nThe results obtained above can be shown to apply to any planar loop:\n\na planar current loop is equivalent to a magnetic dipole of dipole moment\n\nm = I A, which is the analogue of electric dipole moment p. Note, however,\na fundamental difference: an electric dipole is built up of two elementary\nunits — the charges (or electric monopoles). In magnetism, a magnetic\n\ndipole (or a current loop) is the most elementary element. The equivalent\nof electric charges, i.e., magnetic monopoles, are not known to exist.\n\nWe have shown that a current loop (i) produces a magnetic field (see\n\nFig. 4.12) and behaves like a magnetic dipole at large distances, and\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n162\n\n(ii) is subject to torque like a magnetic needle. This led Ampere to suggest\nthat all magnetism is due to circulating currents. This seems to be partly\n\ntrue and no magnetic monopoles have been seen so far. However,\nelementary particles such as an electron or a proton also carry an intrinsic\nmagnetic moment, not accounted by circulating currents.\n\n4.10.3  The magnetic dipole moment of a revolving electron\n\nIn Chapter 12 we shall read about the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom.\nYou may perhaps have heard of this model which was proposed by the\n\nDanish physicist Niels Bohr in 1911 and was a stepping stone\n\nto a new kind of mechanics, namely, quantum mechanics.\nIn the Bohr model, the electron (a negatively charged particle)\nrevolves around a positively charged nucleus much as a\n\nplanet revolves around the sun. The force in the former case\nis electrostatic (Coulomb force) while it is gravitational for\nthe planet-Sun case. We show this Bohr picture of the electron\n\nin Fig. 4.23.\nThe electron of charge (–e)  (e = + 1.6 ×  10\n\n–19\n C) performs\n\nuniform circular motion around a stationary heavy nucleus\n\nof charge +Ze. This constitutes a  current I, where,\n\ne\nI\n\nT\n= (4.32)\n\nand T is the time period of revolution. Let r be the orbital\n\nradius of the electron, and v the orbital speed. Then,\n\nπ2 r\nT =\n\nv\n(4.33)\n\nSubstituting in Eq. (4.32), we have I = ev/2πr.\nThere will be a magnetic moment, usually denoted by µ\n\nl\n,\n\nassociated with this circulating current. From Eq. (4.28) its\nmagnitude is, µ\n\nl\n = Iπr\n\n2\n = evr/2.\n\nThe direction of this magnetic moment is into the plane\n\nof the paper in Fig. 4.23. [This follows from the right-hand\nrule discussed earlier and the fact that the negatively charged\n\nelectron is moving anticlockwise, leading to a clockwise current.]\n\nMultiplying and dividing the right-hand side of the above expression by\nthe electron mass m\n\ne\n, we have,\n\n( )\n2\n\nl e\n\ne\n\ne\nm vr\n\nm\nµ =\n\n    \n2 e\n\ne\nl\n\nm\n= [4.34(a)]\n\nHere, l is the magnitude of the angular momentum of the electron\n\nabout the central nucleus (“orbital” angular momentum). Vectorially,\n\nµµµµµ\nl = –\n\n2\nl\n\ne\n\ne\n\nm\nl          [4.34(b)]\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the angular momentum of the electron\nis opposite in direction to the magnetic moment. Instead of electron with\n\nFIGURE 4.23 In the Bohr model\n\nof hydrogen-like atoms, the\nnegatively charged electron is\nrevolving with uniform speed\n\naround a centrally placed\npositively charged (+Z e)\n\nnucleus. The uniform circular\n\nmotion of the electron\nconstitutes a current. The\ndirection of the magnetic\n\nmoment is into the plane of the\npaper and is indicated\n\nseparately by ⊗.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nMoving Charges and\n\nMagnetism\n\n163\n\ncharge (–e), if we had taken a particle with charge (+q), the angular\nmomentum and magnetic moment would be in the same direction. The\n\nratio\n\nl\n\n2 e\n\ne\n\nl m\n\nµ\n= (4.35)\n\nis called the gyromagnetic ratio and is a constant. Its value is 8.8 × 10\n10\n\n C /kg\nfor an electron, which has been verified by experiments.\n\nThe fact that even at an atomic level there is a magnetic moment,\n\nconfirms Ampere’s bold hypothesis of atomic magnetic moments. This\naccording to Ampere, would help one to explain the magnetic properties\nof materials. Can one assign a value to this atomic dipole moment?  The\n\nanswer is Yes. One can do so within the Bohr model. Bohr hypothesised\nthat the angular momentum assumes a discrete set of values, namely,\n\n2\n\nn h\nl =\n\nπ\n(4.36)\n\nwhere n is a natural number, n = 1, 2, 3, .... and h is a constant named\n\nafter Max Planck (Planck’s constant) with a value h = 6.626 × 10–34 J s.\n\nThis condition of discreteness is called the Bohr quantisation condition.\n\nWe shall discuss it in detail in Chapter 12. Our aim here is merely to use\n\nit to calculate the elementary dipole moment. Take the value n = 1, we\n\nhave from Eq. (4.34) that,\n\nmin( )\n4\n\nl\n\ne\n\ne\nh\n\nm\nµ =\n\nπ\n\n    \n19 34\n\n31\n\n1.60 10 6.63 10\n\n4 3.14 9.11 10\n\n− −\n\n−\n\n× × ×\n=\n\n× × ×\n\n    = 9.27 × 10\n–24\n\n Am\n2\n\n(4.37)\n\nwhere the subscript ‘min’ stands for minimum. This value is called the\n\nBohr magneton.\n\nAny charge in uniform circular motion would have an associated\n\nmagnetic moment given by an expression similar to Eq. (4.34). This dipole\n\nmoment is labelled as the orbital magnetic moment. Hence, the subscript\n\n‘l’ in µ\nl\n. Besides the orbital moment, the electron has an intrinsic magnetic\n\nmoment, which has the same numerical value as given in Eq. (4.37). It is\n\ncalled the spin magnetic moment. But we hasten to add that it is not as\n\nthough the electron is spinning. The electron is an elementary particle\n\nand it does not have an axis to spin around like a top or our earth.\n\nNevertheless, it does possess this intrinsic magnetic moment. The\n\nmicroscopic roots of magnetism in iron and other materials can be traced\n\nback to this intrinsic spin magnetic moment.\n\n4.11  THE MOVING COIL GALVANOMETER\nCurrents and voltages in circuits have been discussed extensively in\n\nChapters 3. But how do we measure them? How do we claim that\ncurrent in a circuit is 1.5 A or the voltage drop across a resistor is 1.2 V?\nFigure 4.24 exhibits a very useful instrument for this purpose: the moving\n\nC\no\n\nn\nv\ne\nrs\n\nio\nn\n\n o\nf g\n\na\nlv\n\na\nn\n\no\nm\n\ne\nte\n\nr in\nto\n\n a\nm\n\nm\ne\nte\n\nr a\nn\n\nd\n v\n\no\nltm\n\ne\nte\n\nr:\n\nw\nw\n\nw\n.c\n\nity\nc\no\nlle\n\ng\nia\n\nte\n.c\n\no\nm\n\n/g\na\nlv\n\na\nn\no\nm\n\ne\nte\n\nr_\nX\nIIa\n\n.h\ntm\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n164\n\ncoil galvanometer (MCG). It is a device whose principle can be understood\non the basis of our discussion in Section 4.10.\n\nThe galvanometer consists of a coil, with many turns, free to rotate\nabout a fixed axis (Fig. 4.24), in a uniform radial magnetic field. There is\na cylindrical soft iron core which not only makes the field radial but also\n\nincreases the strength of the magnetic field.  When a current flows through\nthe coil, a torque acts on it. This torque is given by Eq. (4.26) to be\n\nτ = NI AB\n\nwhere the symbols have their usual meaning. Since the field is radial by\ndesign, we have taken sin θ = 1 in the above expression for the torque.\nThe magnetic torque NIAB tends to rotate the coil. A spring S\n\np\n provides a\n\ncounter torque kφ that balances the magnetic torque NIAB; resulting in a\nsteady angular deflection φ. In equilibrium\n\nkφ = NI AB\n\nwhere k is the torsional constant of the spring; i.e. the restoring torque\nper unit twist. The deflection φ is indicated on the scale by a pointer\nattached to the spring. We have\n\nφ =\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f7\n\nNAB\n\nk\nI (4.38)\n\nThe quantity in brackets is a constant for a given\ngalvanometer.\n\nThe galvanometer can be used in a number of ways.\n\nIt can be used as a detector to check if a current is\nflowing in the circuit. We have come across this usage\nin the Wheatstone’s bridge arrangement. In this usage\n\nthe neutral position of the pointer (when no current is\nflowing through the galvanometer) is in the middle of\nthe scale and not at the left end as shown in Fig.4.24.\n\nDepending on the direction of the current, the pointer’s\ndeflection is either to the right or the left.\n\nThe galvanometer cannot as such be used as an\nammeter to measure the value of the current in a given\n\ncircuit. This is for two reasons: (i) Galvanometer is a\n\nvery sensitive device, it gives a full-scale deflection for\n\na current of the order of µA. (ii) For measuring\ncurrents, the galvanometer has to be connected in\n\nseries, and as it has a large resistance, this will change\n\nthe value of the current in the circuit. To overcome\n\nthese difficulties, one attaches a small resistance r\ns\n,\n\ncalled shunt resistance, in parallel with\n\nthe galvanometer coil; so that most of the current\n\npasses through the shunt. The resistance of this\n\narrangement is,\n\nR\nG\n r\n\ns \n/ (R\n\nG\n  + r\n\ns\n)   ;  r\n\ns\n         if    R\n\nG\n >>  r\n\ns\n\nIf r\ns \nhas small value, in relation to the resistance of\n\nthe rest of the circuit R\nc\n, the effect of introducing the\n\nmeasuring instrument is also small and negligible. This\n\nFIGURE 4.24 The moving coil\n\ngalvanometer. Its elements are\ndescribed in the text. Depending on\nthe requirement, this device can be\n\nused as a current detector or for\nmeasuring the value of the current\n\n(ammeter) or voltage (voltmeter).\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nMoving Charges and\n\nMagnetism\n\n165\n\narrangement is schematically shown in Fig. 4.25. The scale of this\nammeter is calibrated and then graduated to read off the current value\n\nwith ease. We define the current sensitivity of the galvanometer as the\ndeflection per unit current. From Eq. (4.38) this current sensitivity is,\n\nNAB\n\nI k\n\nφ\n= (4.39)\n\nA convenient way for the manufacturer  to increase the sensitivity is\nto increase the number of turns N. We choose galvanometers having\nsensitivities of value, required by our experiment.\n\nThe galvanometer can also be used as a voltmeter to measure the\nvoltage across a given section of the circuit. For this it must be connected\nin parallel with that section of the circuit. Further, it must draw a very\n\nsmall current, otherwise the voltage measurement will disturb the original\nset up by an amount which is very large. Usually we like to keep the\ndisturbance due to the measuring device below one per cent.  To ensure\n\nthis, a large resistance R is connected in series with the galvanometer.\nThis arrangement is schematically depicted in Fig.4.26. Note that the\nresistance of the voltmeter is now,\n\nR\nG\n + R ; R :  large\n\nThe scale of the voltmeter is calibrated to read off the voltage value\nwith ease. We define the voltage sensitivity as the deflection per unit\nvoltage. From Eq. (4.38),\n\nφ\n\nV\n\nNAB\n\nk\n\nI\n\nV\n\nNAB\n\nk R\n=\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f7 =\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f7\n\n1\n(4.40)\n\nAn interesting point to note is that increasing the current sensitivity\nmay not necessarily increase the voltage sensitivity. Let us take Eq. (4.39)\n\nwhich provides a measure of current sensitivity. If N → 2N, i.e., we double\nthe number of turns, then\n\n2\nI I\n\nφ φ\n→\n\nThus, the current sensitivity doubles. However, the resistance of the\ngalvanometer is also likely to double, since it is proportional to the length\nof the wire. In Eq. (4.40), N →2N, and R →2R, thus the voltage sensitivity,\n\nV V\n\nφ φ\n→\n\nremains unchanged. So in general, the modification needed for conversion\nof a galvanometer to an ammeter  will be different from what is needed\n\nfor converting it into a voltmeter.\n\nExample 4.13 In the circuit (Fig. 4.27) the current is to be\n\nmeasured. What is the value of the current if the ammeter shown\n\n(a) is a galvanometer with a resistance R\nG\n = 60.00 Ω; (b) is a\n\ngalvanometer described in (a) but converted to an ammeter by a\n\nshunt resistance r\ns\n = 0.02 Ω; (c) is an ideal ammeter with zero\n\nresistance?\n\nFIGURE 4.25\n\nConversion of a\ngalvanometer (G) to\nan ammeter by the\n\nintroduction of a\nshunt resistance r\n\ns\n of\n\nvery small value in\n\nparallel.\n\nFIGURE 4.26\n\nConversion of a\ngalvanometer (G) to a\n\nvoltmeter by the\n\nintroduction of a\nresistance R of large\n\nvalue in series.\n\nE\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 4\n\n.1\n3\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n166\n\nFIGURE 4.27\n\nSolution\n(a) Total resistance in the circuit is,\n\n3 63GR + = Ω .

The total force on a charge q moving with velocity v in the presence of\nmagnetic and electric fields B and E, respectively is called the Lorentz\nforce. It is given by the expression:\nF = q (v × B + E)\nThe magnetic force q (v × B) is normal to v and work done by it is zero.\n\n2. A straight conductor of length l and carrying a steady current I\n\nexperiences a force F in a uniform external magnetic field B,\n\nF = I l × B\n\nwhere|l| = l and the direction of l is given by the direction of the\ncurrent.\n\n3. In a uniform magnetic field B, a charge q executes a circular orbit in\na plane normal to B. Its frequency of uniform circular motion is called\nthe cyclotron frequency and is given by:\n\n2\nc\n\nq B\n\nm\nν =\n\nπ\n\nThis frequency is independent of the particle’s speed and radius. This\n\nfact is exploited in a machine, the cyclotron, which is used to\naccelerate charged particles.\n\n4. The Biot-Savart law asserts that the magnetic field dB due to an\nelement dl carrying a steady current I at a point P at a distance r from\nthe current element is:\n\n0\n\n3\n\nd\nd\n\n4\nI\n\nr\n\nµ ×\n=\n\nπ\n\nl r\nB\n\nE\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 4\n\n.1\n3\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nMoving Charges and\n\nMagnetism\n\n167\n\nTo obtain the total field at P, we must integrate this vector expression\n\nover the entire length of the conductor.\n\n5. The magnitude of the magnetic field due to a circular coil of radius R\n\ncarrying a current I at an axial distance x from the centre is\n\n2\n0\n\n2 2 3/2\n2( )\n\nIR\nB\n\nx R\n\nµ\n=\n\n+\n\nAt the centre this reduces to\n\n0\n\n2\n\nI\nB\n\nR\n\nµ\n=\n\n6. Ampere’s Circuital Law:  Let an open surface S be bounded by a loop\n\nC. Then the Ampere’s law states that B l.d I=∫ µ0\nC\n\nÑ  where I refers to\n\nthe current passing through S. The sign of I is determined from the\n\nright-hand rule. We have discussed a simplified form of this law. If B\nis directed along the tangent to every point on the perimeter L of a\n\nclosed curve and is constant in magnitude along perimeter then,\n\nBL = µ\n0\n I\n\ne\n\nwhere I\ne\n is the net current enclosed by the closed circuit.\n\n7. The magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance R from a long,\n\nstraight wire carrying a current I is given by:\n\nπ\n\n0\n\n2\n\nI\nB\n\nR\n\nµ\n=\n\nThe field lines are circles concentric with the wire.\n\n8. The magnitude of the field B inside a long solenoid carrying a current\nI is\n\nB = µ\n0\nnI\n\nwhere n is the number of turns per unit length. For a toroid one\n\nobtains,\n\n0\n\n2\n\nNI\nB\n\nr\n\nµ\n=\n\nπ\n\nwhere N is the total number of turns and r is the average radius.\n\n9. Parallel currents attract and anti-parallel currents repel.\n\n10. A planar loop carrying a current I, having N closely wound turns, and\nan area A possesses a magnetic moment m where,\n\nm = N I A\n\nand the direction of m is given by the right-hand thumb rule : curl\nthe palm of your right hand along the loop with the fingers pointing\n\nin the direction of the current. The thumb sticking out gives the\n\ndirection of m (and A)\n\nWhen this loop is placed in a uniform magnetic field B, the force F on\nit is:  F = 0\n\nAnd the torque on it is,\n\nτ = m × B\n\nIn a moving coil galvanometer, this torque is balanced by a counter-\n\ntorque due to a spring, yielding\n\nkφ = NI AB\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n168\n\nwhere φ  is the equilibrium deflection and k the torsion constant of\n\nthe spring.\n\n11. An electron moving around the central nucleus has a magnetic moment\n\nµ\nl\n given by:\n\n2\nl\n\ne\nl\n\nm\nµ =\n\nwhere l is the magnitude of the angular momentum of the circulating\n\nelectron about the central nucleus. The smallest value of µ\nl\n is called\n\nthe Bohr magneton µ\nB\n and it is  µ\n\nB\n = 9.27×10–24 J/T\n\n12. A moving coil galvanometer can be converted into a ammeter by\n\nintroducing a shunt resistance r\ns\n, of small value in parallel. It can be\n\nconverted into a voltmeter by introducing a resistance of a large value\n\nin series.\n\nPhysical Quantity Symbol Nature Dimensions Units Remarks\n\nPermeability of free µ\n0\n\nScalar [MLT\n–2\n\nA\n–2\n\n] T m A\n–1\n\n4π × 10\n–7\n\n T m A\n–1\n\nspace\n\nMagnetic Field B Vector [M T\n–2\n\nA\n–1\n\n] T (telsa)\n\nMagnetic Moment m Vector [L\n2\nA] A m\n\n2\n or J/T\n\nTorsion Constant k   Scalar [M L\n2\nT\n\n–2\n]     N m rad\n\n–1\nAppears in MCG\n\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n\n1.

The discussion in this Chapter holds only for steady currents which do\n\nnot vary with time.\n\nWhen currents vary with time Newton’s third law is valid only if momentum\ncarried by the electromagnetic field is taken into account.\n\n3. Recall the expression for the Lorentz force,\n\nF = q (v × B + E)\n\nThis velocity dependent force has occupied the attention of some of the\n\ngreatest scientific thinkers. If one switches to a frame with instantaneous\n\nvelocity v, the magnetic part of the force vanishes. The motion of the\ncharged particle is then explained by arguing that there exists an\n\nappropriate electric field in the new frame. We shall not discuss the\n\ndetails of this mechanism. However, we stress that the resolution of this\n\nparadox implies that electricity and magnetism are linked phenomena\n\n(electromagnetism) and that the Lorentz force expression does not imply\n\na universal preferred frame of reference in nature.\n4. Ampere’s Circuital law is not independent of the Biot-Savart law. It\n\ncan be derived from the Biot-Savart law. Its relationship to the\n\nBiot-Savart law is similar to the relationship between Gauss’s law and\n\nCoulomb’s law.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nMoving Charges and\n\nMagnetism\n\n169\n\nEXERCISES\n\n4.1 A circular coil of wire consisting of 100 turns, each of radius 8.0 cm\n\ncarries a current of 0.40 A.

Vast, distant galaxies, the\n\ntiny invisible atoms, humans and beasts all are permeated through and\n\nthrough with a host of magnetic fields from a variety of sources. The earth’s\n\nmagnetism predates human evolution. The word magnet is derived from\n\nthe name of an island in Greece called magnesia where magnetic ore\n\ndeposits were found, as early as 600 BC. Shepherds on this island\n\ncomplained that their wooden shoes (which had nails) at times stayed\n\nstruck to the ground. Their iron-tipped rods were similarly affected. This\n\nattractive property of magnets made it difficult for them to move around.\n\nThe directional property of magnets was also known since ancient\n\ntimes. A thin long piece of a magnet, when suspended freely, pointed in\n\nthe north-south direction. A similar effect was observed when it was placed\n\non a piece of cork which was then allowed to float in still water. The name\n\nlodestone (or loadstone) given to a naturally occurring ore of iron-\n\nmagnetite means leading stone. The technological exploitation of this\n\nproperty is generally credited to the Chinese. Chinese texts dating 400\n\nBC mention the use of magnetic needles for navigation on ships. Caravans\n\ncrossing the Gobi desert also employed magnetic needles.\n\nA Chinese legend narrates the tale of the victory of the emperor Huang-ti\n\nabout four thousand years ago, which he owed to his craftsmen (whom\n\nChapter Five\n\nMAGNETISM AND\n\nMATTER\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n174\n\nnowadays you would call engineers). These ‘engineers’\n\nbuilt a chariot on which they placed a magnetic figure\n\nwith arms outstretched. Figure 5.1 is an artist’s\n\ndescription of this chariot. The figure swiveled around\n\nso that the finger of the statuette on it always pointed\n\nsouth. With this chariot, Huang-ti’s troops were able\n\nto attack the enemy from the rear in thick fog, and to\n\ndefeat them.\n\nIn the previous chapter we have learned that moving\n\ncharges or electric currents produce magnetic fields.\n\nThis discovery, which was made in the early part of the\n\nnineteenth century is credited to Oersted, Ampere, Biot\n\nand Savart, among others.\n\nIn the present chapter, we take a look at magnetism\n\nas a subject in its own right.\n\nSome of the commonly known ideas regarding\n\nmagnetism are:\n\n(i) The earth behaves as a magnet with the magnetic\n\nfield pointing approximately from the geographic\n\nsouth to the north.\n\n(ii) When a bar magnet is freely suspended, it points in  the north-south\n\ndirection. The tip which points to the geographic north is called the\n\nnorth pole and the tip which points to the geographic south is called\n\nthe south pole of the magnet.\n\n(iii) There is a repulsive force when north poles ( or south poles ) of two\n\nmagnets are brought close together. Conversely, there is an attractive\n\nforce between the north pole of one magnet and the south pole of\n\nthe other.\n\n(iv) We cannot isolate the north, or south pole of a magnet. If a bar magnet\n\nis broken into two halves, we get two similar bar magnets with\n\nsomewhat weaker properties. Unlike electric charges, isolated magnetic\n\nnorth and south poles known as magnetic monopoles do not exist.\n\n(v) It is possible to make magnets out of iron and its alloys.\n\nWe begin with a description of a bar magnet and its behaviour in an\n\nexternal magnetic field. We describe Gauss’s law of magnetism. We then\n\nfollow it up with an account of the earth’s magnetic field. We next describe\n\nhow materials can be classified on the basis of their magnetic properties.\n\nWe describe para-, dia-, and ferromagnetism. We conclude with a section\n\non electromagnets and permanent magnets.\n\n5.2  THE BAR MAGNET\nOne of the earliest childhood memories of the famous physicist Albert\n\nEinstein was that of a magnet gifted to him by a relative. Einstein was\n\nfascinated, and played endlessly with it. He wondered how the magnet\n\ncould affect objects such as nails or pins placed away from it and not in\n\nany way connected to it by a spring or string.\n\nFIGURE 5.1 The arm of the statuette\n\nmounted on the chariot always points\nsouth. This is an artist’s sketch of one\n\nof the earliest known compasses,\n\nthousands of years old.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nMagnetism and\n\nMatter\n\n175\n\nWe begin our study by examining iron filings sprinkled on a sheet of\nglass placed over a short bar magnet. The arrangement of iron filings is\n\nshown in Fig. 5.2.\n The pattern of iron filings suggests that the magnet has two poles\n\nsimilar to the positive and negative charge of an electric dipole. As\n\nmentioned in the introductory section, one pole is designated the North\npole and the other, the South pole. When suspended freely, these poles\npoint approximately towards the geographic north and south poles,\n\nrespectively. A similar pattern of iron filings is observed around a current\ncarrying solenoid.\n\n5.2.1  The magnetic field lines\n\nThe pattern of iron filings permits us to plot the magnetic field lines*. This is\n\nshown both for the bar-magnet and the current-carrying solenoid in\nFig. 5.3. For comparison refer to the Chapter 1, Figure 1.17(d). Electric field\nlines of an electric dipole are also displayed in Fig. 5.3(c). The magnetic field\n\nlines are a visual and intuitive realisation of the magnetic field. Their\nproperties are:\n(i) The magnetic field lines of a magnet (or a solenoid) form continuous\n\nclosed loops. This is unlike the electric dipole where these field lines\nbegin from a positive charge and end on the negative charge or escape\nto infinity.\n\n(ii) The tangent to the field line at a given point represents the direction of\nthe net magnetic field B at that point.\n\nFIGURE 5.2 The\n\narrangement of iron\nfilings surrounding a\n\nbar magnet. The\n\npattern mimics\nmagnetic field lines.\nThe pattern suggests\n\nthat the bar magnet\nis a magnetic dipole.\n\n* In some textbooks the magnetic field lines are called magnetic lines of force.\nThis nomenclature is avoided since it can be confusing. Unlike electrostatics\n\nthe field lines in magnetism do not indicate the direction of the force on a\n\n(moving) charge.\n\nFIGURE 5.3 The field lines of (a) a bar magnet, (b) a current-carrying finite solenoid and\n(c) electric dipole. At large distances, the field lines are very similar. The curves\n\nlabelled  i  and ii are closed Gaussian surfaces.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n176\n\n(iii) The larger the number of field lines crossing per unit area, the stronger\nis the magnitude of the magnetic field B. In Fig. 5.3(a), B is larger\n\naround region  ii  than in region  i  .\n(iv) The magnetic field lines do not intersect, for if they did, the direction\n\nof the magnetic field would not be unique at the point of intersection.\n\nOne can plot the magnetic field lines in a variety of ways. One way is\nto place a small magnetic compass needle at various positions and note\nits orientation. This gives us an idea of the magnetic field direction at\n\nvarious points in space.\n\n5.2.2  Bar magnet as an equivalent solenoid\n\nIn the previous chapter, we have explained how a current loop acts as a\nmagnetic dipole (Section 4.10). We mentioned Ampere’s hypothesis that\n\nall magnetic phenomena can be explained in terms of circulating currents.\nRecall that the magnetic dipole moment m\nassociated with a current loop was defined\n\nto be m = NI A where N is the number of\nturns in the loop, I the current and A the\narea vector (Eq. 4.30).\n\nThe resemblance of magnetic field lines\nfor a bar magnet and a solenoid suggest that\na bar magnet may be thought of as a large\n\nnumber of circulating currents in analogy\nwith a solenoid. Cutting a bar magnet in half\nis like cutting a solenoid. We get two smaller\n\nsolenoids with weaker magnetic properties.\nThe field lines remain continuous, emerging\nfrom one face of the solenoid and entering\n\ninto the other face. One can test this analogy\nby moving a small compass needle in the\nneighbourhood of a bar magnet and a\n\ncurrent-carrying finite solenoid and noting\nthat the deflections of the needle are similar\nin both cases.\n\nTo make this analogy more firm we\n\ncalculate the axial field of a finite solenoid\n\ndepicted in Fig. 5.4 (a). We shall demonstrate\n\nthat at large distances this axial field\n\nresembles that of a bar magnet.\n\nLet the solenoid of Fig. 5.4(a) consists of\n\nn turns per unit length. Let its length be 2l\n\nand radius a. We can evaluate the axial field\n\nat a point P, at a distance r from the centre O\n\nof the solenoid. To do this, consider a circular element of thickness dx of\n\nthe solenoid at a distance x from its centre. It consists of n dx turns. Let I\n\nbe the current in the solenoid. In Section 4.6 of the previous chapter we\n\nhave calculated the magnetic field on the axis of a circular current loop.\n\nFrom Eq. (4.13), the magnitude of the field at point P due to the circular\n\nelement is\n\nFIGURE 5.4 Calculation of (a) The axial field of a\nfinite solenoid in order to demonstrate its similarity\n\nto that of a bar magnet. (b) A magnetic needle\nin a uniform magnetic field B. The\n\narrangement may be used to\n\ndetermine either B or the magnetic\nmoment m of the needle.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nMagnetism and\n\nMatter\n\n177\n\ndB\nndx Ia\n\nr x a\n=\n\n− +\n\nµ0\n2\n\n2 22\n3\n\n2[( ) ]\n\nThe magnitude of the total field is obtained by summing over all the\nelements — in other words by integrating from x = – l to x = + l .

This\nexercise, however, is not necessary for our purpose. Note that the range\nof x is from  – l to + l . Consider the far axial field of the solenoid, i.e.,\n\nr >> a and r >> l . Then the denominator is approximated by\n\n3\n2 2 32[( ) ]r x a r− + ≈\n\nand B\nn I a\n\nr\ndx\n\nl\n\nl\n\n=\n−\n∫\n\nµ0\n2\n\n3\n2\n\n      =  \n2\n\n0\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\nn I l a\n\nr\n\nµ\n (5.1)\n\nNote that the magnitude of the magnetic moment of the solenoid is,\nm = n (2 l) I (πa2) — (total number of turns × current × cross-sectional\narea). Thus,\n\n0\n\n3\n\n2\n\n4\n\nm\nB\n\nr\n\nµ\nπ\n\n= (5.2)\n\nThis is also the far axial magnetic field of a bar magnet which one may\n\nobtain experimentally. Thus, a bar magnet and a solenoid produce similar\n\nmagnetic fields. The magnetic moment of a bar magnet is thus equal to\n\nthe magnetic moment of an equivalent solenoid that produces the same\n\nmagnetic field.\n\nSome textbooks assign a magnetic charge (also called pole strength)\n\n+q\nm\nto the north pole and –q\n\nm\n to the south pole of a bar magnet of length\n\n2l , and magnetic moment q\nm\n(2l). The field strength due to q\n\nm\n at a distance\n\nr from it is given by µ\n0\nq\n\nm\n/4πr2. The magnetic field due to the bar magnet\n\nis then obtained, both for the axial and the equatorial case, in a manner\n\nanalogous to that of an electric dipole (Chapter 1). The method is simple\n\nand appealing. However, magnetic monopoles do not exist, and we have\n\navoided this approach for that reason.\n\n5.2.3  The dipole in a uniform magnetic field\n\nThe pattern of iron filings, i.e., the magnetic field lines gives us an\napproximate idea of the magnetic field B. We may at times be required to\ndetermine the magnitude of B accurately. This is done by placing a small\n\ncompass needle of known magnetic moment m and moment of inertia IIIII\nand allowing it to oscillate in the magnetic field. This arrangement is shown\nin Fig. 5.4(b).\n\nThe torque on the needle is [see Eq. (4.29)],\n\nτττττ = m × B (5.3)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n178  E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 5\n\n.1\n\nIn magnitude τ = mB sinθ\nHere τττττ  is restoring torque and θ is the angle between m and B.\n\nTherefore, in equilibrium \n2\n\n2\nsin\n\nθ\nθ= −\n\nd\nmB\n\ndt\nI\n\nNegative sign with mB sinθ implies that restoring torque is in opposition\nto deflecting torque. For small values of θ in radians, we approximate\nsin θ ≈ θ  and get\n\n2\n\n2\n–\n\nθ\nθ≈\n\nd\nmB\n\ndt\nI\n\nor,  \n2\n\n2\n\nθ\nθ= −\n\nd mB\n\ndt I\nThis represents a simple harmonic motion. The square of the angular\n\nfrequency is ω2 = mB/I and the time period is,\n\n2π=T\nmB\n\nI\n(5.4)\n\nor     \n4\n\n2\n\n2\n\nπ\n=B\n\nm T\n\nI\n(5.5)\n\nAn expression for magnetic potential energy can also be obtained on\n\nlines similar to  electrostatic potential energy.\nThe magnetic potential energy U\n\nm\n is given by\n\nU dm = ∫ τ θ θ( )\n\n      = = −∫mB d mBsin cosθ θ θ\n      = −m B. (5.6)\nWe have emphasised in Chapter 2 that the zero of potential energy\n\ncan be fixed at one’s convenience. Taking the constant of integration to be\nzero means fixing the zero of potential energy at θ = 90°, i.e., when the\nneedle is perpendicular to the field. Equation (5.6) shows that potential\nenergy is minimum (= –mB) at θ = 0° (most stable position) and maximum\n(= +mB) at θ = 180° (most unstable position).\n\nExample 5.1 In Fig. 5.4(b), the magnetic needle has magnetic moment\n6.7 × 10\n\n–2\n Am\n\n2\n and moment of inertia I = 7.5 × 10\n\n–6 \nkg m\n\n2\n.

An iron nail near a bar magnet, however,\n\nexperiences a force of attraction in addition to a torque. Why?\n(c) Must every magnetic configuration have a north pole and a south\n\npole? What about the field due to a toroid?\n\n(d) Two identical looking iron bars A and B are given, one of which is\ndefinitely known to be magnetised. (We do not know which one.)\nHow would one ascertain whether or not both are magnetised? If\n\nonly one is magnetised, how does one ascertain which one?  [Use\nnothing else but the bars A and B.]\n\nSolution\n(a) In either case, one gets two magnets, each with a north and south\n\npole.\n(b) No force if the field is uniform. The iron nail experiences a non-\n\nuniform field due to the bar magnet. There is induced magnetic\nmoment in the nail, therefore, it experiences both force and torque.\nThe net force is attractive because the induced south pole (say) in\nthe nail is closer to the north pole of magnet than induced north\npole.\n\n(c) Not necessarily. True only if the source of the field has a net non-\nzero magnetic moment. This is not so for a toroid or even for a\nstraight infinite conductor.\n\n(d) Try to bring different ends of the bars closer. A repulsive force in\nsome situation establishes that both are magnetised. If it is always\nattractive, then one of them is not magnetised. In a bar magnet\nthe intensity of the magnetic field is the strongest at the two ends\n(poles) and weakest at the central region. This fact may be used to\ndetermine whether A or B is the magnet.

In Fig 5.3(c), we\n\nsee that for a closed surface represented by  i , the number of lines leaving\n\nthe surface is equal to the number of lines entering it. This is consistent\n\nwith the fact that no net charge is enclosed by the surface. However, in\n\nthe same figure, for the closed surface ii , there is a net outward flux, since\n\nit does include a net (positive) charge.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n182  E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 5\n\n.6\n\nThe situation is radically different for magnetic fields\nwhich are continuous and form closed loops. Examine the\n\nGaussian surfaces represented by  i  or  ii  in Fig 5.3(a) or\nFig. 5.3(b). Both cases visually demonstrate that the\nnumber of magnetic field lines leaving the surface is\n\nbalanced by the number of lines entering it. The net\nmagnetic flux is zero for both the surfaces. This is true\nfor any closed surface.\n\nFIGURE 5.6\n\nConsider a small vector area element ∆S of a closed\nsurface S as in Fig. 5.6. The magnetic flux through ÄS is\ndefined as ∆φ\n\nB\n = B.∆S, where B is the field  at ∆S. We divide\n\nS into many small area elements and calculate the\nindividual flux through each. Then, the net flux φ\n\nB\n is,\n\nφ φB B\nall all\n\n= = =∑ ∑∆ ∆\n’ ’ ’ ’\n\nB S. 0 (5.9)\n\nwhere ‘all’ stands for ‘all area elements ∆S′. Compare this\nwith the Gauss’s law of electrostatics. The flux through a closed surface\nin that case is given by\n\nE S.∆ =∑\nq\n\nε0\nwhere q is the electric charge enclosed by the surface.\n\nThe difference between the Gauss’s law of magnetism and that for\n\nelectrostatics is a reflection of the fact that isolated magnetic poles (also\ncalled monopoles) are not known to exist. There are no sources or sinks\nof B; the simplest magnetic element is a dipole or a current loop. All\n\nmagnetic phenomena can be explained in terms of an arrangement of\ndipoles and/or current loops.\nThus, Gauss’s law for magnetism is:\n\nThe net magnetic flux through any closed surface is zero.\n\nExample 5.6  Many of the diagrams given in Fig. 5.7 show magnetic\nfield lines (thick lines in the figure) wrongly. Point out what is wrong\n\nwith them.

Along with\nWilhelm Welser, he built the\nfirst electric telegraph in\n\n1833.

Magnetic field lines can never emanate from a point, as\nshown in figure. Over any closed surface, the net flux of B must\nalways be zero, i.e., pictorially as many field lines should seem to\n\nenter the surface as the number of lines leaving it. The field lines\nshown, in fact, represent electric field of a long positively charged\nwire. The correct magnetic field lines are circling the straight\n\nconductor, as described in Chapter 4.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n184  \nE\n\nX\nA\n\nM\nP\nL\nE\n 5\n\n.7\n E\n\nX\nA\n\nM\nP\nL\nE\n 5\n\n.6\n\n(b) Wrong. Magnetic field lines (like electric field lines) can never cross\neach other, because otherwise the direction of field at the point of\nintersection is ambiguous. There is further error in the figure.\nMagnetostatic field lines can never form closed loops around empty\nspace. A closed loop of static magnetic field line must enclose a\nregion across which a current is passing. By contrast, electrostatic\nfield lines can never form closed loops, neither in empty space,\nnor when the loop encloses charges.\n\n(c) Right. Magnetic lines are completely confined within a toroid.\nNothing wrong here in field lines forming closed loops, since each\nloop encloses a region across which a current passes. Note, for\nclarity of figure, only a few field lines within the toroid have been\nshown. Actually, the entire region enclosed by the windings\ncontains magnetic field.\n\n(d) Wrong. Field lines due to a solenoid at its ends and outside cannot\nbe so completely straight and confined; such a thing violates\nAmpere’s law. The lines should curve out at both ends, and meet\neventually to form closed loops.\n\n(e) Right. These are field lines outside and inside a bar magnet. Note\ncarefully the direction of field lines inside. Not all field lines emanate\nout of a north pole (or converge into a south pole). Around both\nthe N-pole, and the S-pole, the net flux of the field is zero.\n\n(f ) Wrong. These field lines cannot possibly represent a magnetic field.\nLook at the upper region. All the field lines seem to emanate out of\nthe shaded plate. The net flux through a surface surrounding the\nshaded plate is not zero. This is impossible for a magnetic field.\nThe given field lines, in fact, show the electrostatic field lines\naround a positively charged upper plate and a negatively charged\nlower plate. The difference between Fig. [5.7(e) and (f )]  should be\ncarefully grasped.\n\n(g) Wrong. Magnetic field lines between two pole pieces cannot be\nprecisely straight at the ends. Some fringing of lines is inevitable.\nOtherwise, Ampere’s law is violated. This is also true for electric\nfield lines.\n\nExample 5.7\n\n(a) Magnetic field lines show the direction (at every point) along which\na small magnetised needle aligns (at the point). Do the magnetic\nfield lines also represent the lines of force on a moving charged\n\nparticle at every point?\n(b) Magnetic field lines can be entirely confined within the core of a\n\ntoroid, but not within a straight solenoid. Why?\n\n(c) If magnetic monopoles existed, how would the Gauss’s law of\nmagnetism be modified?\n\n(d) Does a bar magnet exert a torque on itself due to its own field?\n\nDoes one element of a current-carrying wire exert a force on another\nelement of the same wire?\n\n(e) Magnetic field arises due to charges in motion. Can a system have\n\nmagnetic moments even though its net charge is zero?\n\nSolution\n(a) No. The magnetic force is always normal to B (remember magnetic\n\nforce = qv × B). It is misleading to call magnetic field lines as lines\nof force.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nMagnetism and\n\nMatter\n\n185\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 5\n\n.7\n\n(b) If field lines were entirely confined between two ends of a straight\nsolenoid, the flux through the cross-section at each end would be\nnon-zero. But the flux of field B through any closed surface must\n\nalways be zero. For a toroid, this difficulty is absent because it\nhas no ‘ends’.\n\n(c) Gauss’s law of magnetism states that the flux of B through any\n\nclosed surface is always zero B s.∆ =∫ 0s .\nIf monopoles existed, the right hand side would be equal to the\nmonopole (magnetic charge) q\n\nm\n enclosed by S. [Analogous to\n\nGauss’s law of electrostatics, B s.∆ =∫ µ0qmS  where qm is the\n(monopole) magnetic charge enclosed by S .]\n\n(d) No. There is no force or torque on an element due to the field\nproduced by that element itself. But there is a force (or torque) on\nan element of the same wire. (For the special case of a straight\n\nwire, this force is zero.)\n\n(e) Yes. The average of the charge in the system may be zero. Yet, the\n\nmean of the magnetic moments due to various current loops may\nnot be zero. We will come across such examples in connection\nwith paramagnetic material where atoms have net dipole moment\n\nthrough their net charge is zero.\n\n5.4  THE EARTH’S MAGNETISM\nEarlier we have referred to the magnetic field of the earth. The strength of\n\nthe earth’s magnetic field varies from place to place on the earth’s surface;\n\nits value being of the order of 10\n–5\n\n T.\n\nWhat causes the earth to have a magnetic field is not clear. Originally\n\nthe magnetic field was thought of as arising from a giant bar magnet\n\nplaced approximately along the axis of rotation of the earth and deep in\n\nthe interior. However, this simplistic picture is certainly not correct. The\n\nmagnetic field is now thought to arise due to electrical currents produced\n\nby convective motion of metallic fluids (consisting mostly of molten\n\niron and nickel) in the outer core of the earth. This is known as the\n\ndynamo effect.\n\nThe magnetic field lines of the earth resemble that of a (hypothetical)\n\nmagnetic dipole located at the centre of the earth. The axis of the dipole\n\ndoes not coincide with the axis of rotation of the earth but is presently\n\ntitled by approximately 11.3° with respect to the later. In this way of looking\n\nat it, the magnetic poles are located where the magnetic field lines due to\n\nthe dipole enter or leave the earth. The location of the north magnetic pole\n\nis at a latitude of 79.74° N and a longitude of 71.8° W, a place somewhere\n\nin north Canada. The magnetic south pole is at 79.74° S, 108.22° E in\n\nthe Antarctica.\n\nThe pole near the geographic north pole of the earth is called the north\n\nmagnetic pole. Likewise, the pole near the geographic south pole is called\n\nG\ne\no\nm\n\na\ng\nn\n\ne\nt\nic\n\n fie\nld\n\n fr\ne\nq\n\nu\ne\nn\n\nt\nly\n\n a\ns\nk\ne\nd\n\n q\nu\n\ne\ns\nt\nio\n\nn\ns\n\nh\nttp\n\n://w\nw\n\nw\n.n\n\ng\nd\nc\n.n\n\no\na\na\n.g\n\no\nv\n/g\n\ne\no\nm\n\na\ng\n/\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n186\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 5\n\n.8\n\nthe south magnetic pole. There is some confusion in the\n\nnomenclature of the poles. If one looks at the magnetic\n\nfield lines of the earth (Fig. 5.8), one sees that unlike in the\ncase of a bar magnet, the field lines go into the earth at the\n\nnorth magnetic pole (N\nm\n\n) and come out from the south\nmagnetic pole (S\n\nm\n). The convention arose because the\n\nmagnetic north was the direction to which the north\n\npole of a magnetic needle pointed; the north pole of\na magnet was so named as it was the north seeking\npole. Thus, in reality, the north magnetic pole behaves\n\nlike the south pole of a bar magnet inside the earth and\nvice versa.\n\nExample 5.8 The earth’s magnetic field at the equator is approximately\n0.4 G. Estimate the earth’s dipole moment.\n\nSolution From Eq. (5.7), the equatorial magnetic field is,\n\n0\n\n3\n4\n\nE\n\nm\nB\n\nr\n\nµ\n=\n\nπ\n\nWe are given that B\nE\n ~ 0.4 G = 4 × 10\n\n–5 \nT. For r, we take the radius of\n\nthe earth 6.4 × 10\n6\n m. Hence,\n\n5 6 3\n\n0\n\n4 10 (6.4 10 )\n\n/4\nm\n\nµ\n\n−× × ×\n=\n\nπ\n=4 × 10\n\n2 \n× (6.4 × 10\n\n6\n)\n3\n    (µ\n\n0\n/4π = 10–7)\n\n= 1.05 × 10\n23\n\n A m\n2\n\nThis is close to the value 8 × 10\n22\n\n A m\n2 \n\n quoted in geomagnetic texts.\n\n 5.4.1  Magnetic declination and dip\n\nConsider a point on the earth’s surface. At such a point, the direction of\n\nthe longitude circle determines the geographic north-south direction, the\n\nline of longitude towards the north pole being the direction of\n\ntrue north. The vertical plane containing the longitude circle\n\nand the axis of rotation of the earth is called the geographic\n\nmeridian. In a similar way, one can define magnetic meridian\n\nof a place as the vertical plane which passes through the\n\nimaginary line joining the magnetic north and the south poles.\n\nThis plane would intersect the surface of the earth in a\n\nlongitude like circle. A magnetic needle, which is free to swing\n\nhorizontally, would then lie in the magnetic meridian and the\n\nnorth pole of the needle would point towards the magnetic\n\nnorth pole. Since the line joining the magnetic poles is titled\n\nwith respect to the geographic axis of the earth, the magnetic\n\nmeridian at a point makes angle with the geographic meridian.\n\nThis, then, is the angle between the true geographic north and\n\nthe north shown by a compass needle. This angle is called the\n\nmagnetic declination or simply declination (Fig. 5.9).\n\nThe declination is greater at higher latitudes and smaller\n\nnear the equator. The declination in India is small, it being\n\nFIGURE 5.8 The earth as a giant\nmagnetic dipole.\n\nFIGURE 5.9 A magnetic needle\n\nfree to move in horizontal plane,\npoints toward the magnetic\n\nnorth-south\n\ndirection.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nMagnetism and\n\nMatter\n\n187\n\n0°41′ E at Delhi and 0°58′ W at Mumbai. Thus, at both these places a\nmagnetic needle shows the true north quite accurately.\n\nThere is one more quantity of interest. If a magnetic needle is perfectly\n\nbalanced about a horizontal axis so that it can swing in a plane of the\nmagnetic meridian, the needle would make an angle with the horizontal\n(Fig. 5.10). This is known as the angle of dip (also known as inclination).\n\nThus, dip is the angle that the total magnetic field B\nE\n of the earth makes\n\nwith the surface of the earth. Figure 5.11 shows the magnetic meridian\nplane at a point P on the surface of the earth. The plane is a section through\n\nthe earth. The total magnetic field at P\ncan be resolved into a horizontal\ncomponent H\n\nE\n and a vertical\n\ncomponent Z\nE\n. The angle that B\n\nE\n makes\n\nwith H\nE\n is the angle of dip, I.\n\nIn most of the northern hemisphere, the north pole of the dip needle\n\ntilts downwards. Likewise in most of the southern hemisphere, the south\npole of the dip needle tilts downwards.\n\nTo describe the magnetic field of the earth at a point on its surface, we\n\nneed to specify three quantities, viz., the declination D, the angle of dip or\nthe inclination I and the horizontal component of the earth’s field H\n\nE\n. These\n\nare known as the element of the earth’s magnetic field.\n\nRepresenting the verticle component by Z\nE\n, we have\n\nZ\nE\n = B\n\nE\n sinI [5.10(a)]\n\nH\nE\n = B\n\nE\n cosI [5.10(b)]\n\nwhich gives,\n\ntan E\n\nE\n\nZ\nI\n\nH\n= [5.10(c)]\n\nFIGURE 5.10 The circle is a\nsection through the earth\n\ncontaining the magnetic\nmeridian.

When the\ncompass is held level, it points along the direction of the horizontal component of the earth’s\n\nmagnetic field at the location. Thus, the compass needle would stay along the magnetic\nmeridian of the place. In some places on the earth there are deposits of magnetic minerals\nwhich cause the compass needle to deviate from the magnetic meridian. Knowing the magnetic\n\ndeclination at a place allows us to correct the compass to determine the direction of true\nnorth.\n\nSo what happens if we take our compass to the magnetic pole? At the poles, the magnetic\n\nfield lines are converging or diverging vertically so that the horizontal component is negligible.\nIf the needle is only capable of moving in a horizontal plane, it can point along any direction,\nrendering it useless as a direction finder. What one needs in such a case is a dip needle\n\nwhich is a compass pivoted to move in a vertical plane containing the magnetic field of the\nearth. The needle of the compass then shows the angle which the magnetic field makes with\nthe vertical. At the magnetic poles such a needle will point straight down.\n\nExample 5.9 In the magnetic meridian of a certain place, the\n\nhorizontal component of the earth’s magnetic field is 0.26G and the\ndip angle is 60°. What is the magnetic field of the earth at this location?\n\nSolution\n\nIt is given that H\nE\n = 0.26 G.

One would like to classify the magnetic properties of these\nsubstances. In the present section, we define and explain certain terms\nwhich will help us to carry out this exercise.\n\nWe have seen that a circulating electron in an atom has a magnetic\nmoment. In a bulk material, these moments add up vectorially and they\ncan give a net magnetic moment which is non-zero. We define\n\nmagnetisation M of a sample to be equal to its net magnetic moment per\nunit volume:\n\nnet\n\nV\n=\n\nm\nM (5.11)\n\nM is a vector with dimensions L–1 A and is measured in a units of A m–1.\n\nConsider a long solenoid of n turns per unit length and carrying a\ncurrent I. The magnetic field in the interior of the solenoid was shown to\nbe given by\n\nEARTH’S MAGNETIC FIELD\n\nIt must not be assumed that there is a giant bar magnet deep inside the earth which is\ncausing the earth’s magnetic field. Although there are large deposits of iron inside the earth,\n\nit is highly unlikely that a large solid block of iron stretches from the magnetic north pole to\nthe magnetic south pole. The earth’s core is very hot and molten, and the ions of iron and\nnickel are responsible for earth’s magnetism. This hypothesis seems very probable. Moon,\n\nwhich has no molten core, has no magnetic field, Venus has a slower rate of rotation, and a\nweaker magnetic field, while Jupiter, which has the fastest rotation rate among planets, has\na fairly strong magnetic field. However, the precise mode of these circulating currents and\n\nthe energy needed to sustain them are not very well understood. These are several open\nquestions which form an important area of continuing research.\n\nThe variation of the earth’s magnetic field with position is also an  interesting area of\n\nstudy. Charged particles emitted by the sun flow towards the earth and beyond, in a stream\ncalled the solar wind. Their motion is affected by the earth’s magnetic field, and in turn, they\naffect the pattern of the earth’s magnetic field. The pattern of magnetic field near the poles is\n\nquite different from that in other regions of the earth.\nThe variation of earth’s magnetic field with time is no less  fascinating. There are short\n\nterm variations taking place over centuries and long term variations taking place over a\n\nperiod of a million years. In a span of 240 years from 1580 to 1820 AD, over which records\nare available, the magnetic declination at London has been found to change by 3.5°,\nsuggesting that the magnetic poles inside the earth change position with time. On the scale\n\nof a million years, the earth’s magnetic fields has been found to reverse its direction. Basalt\ncontains iron, and basalt is emitted during volcanic activity. The little iron magnets inside it\nalign themselves parallel to the magnetic field at that place as the basalt cools and solidifies.\n\nGeological studies of basalt containing such pieces of magnetised region have provided\nevidence for the change of direction of earth’s magnetic field, several times in the past.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n190\n\nB\n0\n = µ\n\n0\n nI (5.12)\n\nIf the interior of the solenoid is filled with a material with non-zero\n\nmagnetisation, the field inside the solenoid will be greater than B\n0\n. The\n\nnet B field in the interior of the solenoid may be expressed as\n\nB = B\n0\n + B\n\nm\n(5.13)\n\nwhere B\nm\n is the field contributed by the material core. It turns out that\n\nthis additional field B\nm\n is proportional to the magnetisation M of the\n\nmaterial and is expressed as\n\nB\nm\n = µ\n\n0\nM (5.14)\n\nwhere µ\n0\n is the same constant (permittivity of vacuum) that appears in\n\nBiot-Savart’s law.\nIt is convenient to introduce another vector field H, called the magnetic\n\nintensity, which is defined by\n\n0\n\n–\nµ\n\n=\nB\n\nH M (5.15)\n\nwhere H has the same dimensions as M and is measured in units of A m–1.\n\nThus, the total magnetic field B is written as\n\nB = µ\n0\n (H + M) (5.16)\n\nWe repeat our defining procedure. We have partitioned the contribution\n\nto the total magnetic field inside the sample into two parts: one, due to\n\nexternal factors such as the current in the solenoid. This is represented\n\nby H. The other is due to the specific nature of the magnetic material,\n\nnamely M. The latter quantity can be influenced by external factors. This\n\ninfluence is mathematically expressed as\n\nχ=M H (5.17)\n\nwhere χ , a dimensionless quantity, is appropriately called the magnetic\nsusceptibility. It is a measure of how a magnetic material responds to an\n\nexternal field. Table 5.2 lists χ for some elements. It is small and positive\nfor materials, which are called paramagnetic. It is small and negative for\n\nmaterials, which are termed diamagnetic. In the latter case M and H are\n\nopposite in direction. From Eqs. (5.16) and (5.17) we obtain,\n\n0(1 )µ χ= +B H (5.18)\n\n= µ\n0 \n\nµ\nr \nH\n\n=  µ H (5.19)\n\nwhere µ\nr\n= 1 + χ, is a dimensionless quantity called the relative magnetic\n\npermeability of the substance. It is the analog of the dielectric constant in\n\nelectrostatics. The magnetic permeability of the substance is µ and it has\nthe same dimensions and units as µ\n\n0\n;\n\nµ = µ\n0\nµ\n\nr\n = µ\n\n0\n (1+χ).\n\nThe three quantities χ, µ\nr\n and µ are interrelated and only one of\n\nthem is independent. Given one, the other two may be easily determined.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nMagnetism and\n\nMatter\n\n191\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 5\n\n.1\n0\n\nExample 5.10 A solenoid has a core of a material with relative\npermeability 400.

If the number of turns is 1000 per\n\nmetre, calculate (a) H, (b) M, (c) B and (d) the magnetising current I\nm\n.\n\nSolution\n(a) The field H is dependent of the material of the core, and is\n\nH = nI = 1000 × 2.0 = 2 ×10\n3\n A/m.\n\n(b) The magnetic field B is given by\nB = µ\n\nr\n µ\n\n0\n H\n\n   = 400 × 4π ×10–7 (N/A2) × 2 × 103 (A/m)\n   = 1.0 T\n\n(c) Magnetisation is given by\n\nM = (B– µ\n0\n H )/ µ\n\n0\n\n    = (µ\nr\n µ\n\n0\n H–µ\n\n0\n H )/µ\n\n0\n = (µ\n\nr\n – 1)H = 399 × H\n\n     ≅ 8 × 105 A/m\n(d) The magnetising current I\n\nM\n is the additional current that needs\n\nto be passed through the windings of the solenoid in the absence\nof the core which would give a B value as in the presence of the\n\ncore. Thus B = µ\nr\n n (I + I\n\nM\n). Using I = 2A, B = 1 T, we get I\n\nM\n = 794 A.\n\n5.6  MAGNETIC PROPERTIES OF MATERIALS\nThe discussion in the previous section helps us to classify materials as\n\ndiamagnetic, paramagnetic or ferromagnetic. In terms of the susceptibility\n\nχ , a material is diamagnetic if χ  is negative, para- if χ  is positive and\nsmall, and ferro- if χ  is large and positive.\n\nA glance at Table 5.3 gives one a better feeling for these\n\nmaterials. Here ε is a small positive number introduced to quantify\nparamagnetic materials. Next, we describe these materials in some\n\ndetail.\n\nTABLE 5.2  MAGNETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY OF SOME ELEMENTS AT 300 K\n\nDiamagnetic substance χχχχχ Paramagnetic substance χχχχχ\n\nBismuth –1.66 × 10\n–5\n\nAluminium 2.3 × 10\n–5\n\nCopper –9.8 × 10–6 Calcium 1.9 × 10–5\n\nDiamond –2.2 × 10\n–5\n\nChromium 2.7 × 10\n–4\n\nGold –3.6 × 10\n–5\n\nLithium 2.1 × 10\n–5\n\nLead –1.7 × 10–5 Magnesium 1.2 × 10–5\n\nMercury –2.9 × 10\n–5\n\nNiobium 2.6 × 10\n–5\n\nNitrogen (STP) –5.0 × 10\n–9\n\nOxygen (STP) 2.1 × 10\n–6\n\nSilver –2.6 × 10–5 Platinum 2.9 × 10–4\n\nSilicon –4.2 × 10\n–6\n\nTungsten 6.8 × 10\n–5\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n192\n\n5.6.1  Diamagnetism\n\nDiamagnetic substances are those which have tendency to move from\nstronger to the weaker part of the external magnetic field. In other words,\nunlike the way a magnet attracts metals like iron, it would repel a\ndiamagnetic substance.\n\nFigure 5.12(a) shows a bar of diamagnetic material placed in an external\nmagnetic field. The field lines are repelled or expelled and the field inside\nthe material is reduced. In most cases, as is evident from\nTable 5.2, this reduction is slight, being one part in 10\n\n5\n. When placed in a\n\nnon-uniform magnetic field, the bar will tend to move from high to low field.\nThe simplest explanation for diamagnetism is as follows. Electrons in\n\nan atom orbiting around nucleus possess orbital angular momentum.\nThese orbiting electrons are equivalent to current-carrying loop and thus\npossess orbital magnetic moment. Diamagnetic substances are the ones\nin which resultant magnetic moment in an atom is zero. When magnetic\nfield is applied, those electrons having orbital magnetic moment in the\nsame direction slow down and those in the opposite direction speed up.\nThis happens due to induced current in accordance with Lenz’s law which\nyou will study in Chapter 6. Thus, the substance develops a net magnetic\nmoment in direction opposite to that of the applied field and hence\nrepulsion.\n\nSome diamagnetic materials are bismuth, copper, lead, silicon,\n\nnitrogen (at STP), water and sodium chloride. Diamagnetism is present\n\nin all the substances. However, the effect is so weak in most cases that it\ngets shifted by other effects like paramagnetism, ferromagnetism, etc.\n\nThe most exotic diamagnetic materials are superconductors. These\n\nare metals, cooled to very low temperatures which exhibits both perfect\n\nconductivity and perfect diamagnetism. Here the field lines are completely\nexpelled!  χ = –1 and µ\n\nr\n = 0. A superconductor repels a magnet and (by\n\nNewton’s third law) is repelled by the magnet. The phenomenon of perfect\n\ndiamagnetism in superconductors is called the Meissner effect, after the\n\nname of its discoverer. Superconducting magnets can be gainfully\nexploited in variety of situations, for example, for running magnetically\n\nlevitated superfast trains.\n\n5.6.2  Paramagnetism\n\nParamagnetic substances are those which get weakly magnetised when\nplaced in an external magnetic field. They have tendency to move from a\nregion of weak magnetic field to strong magnetic field, i.e., they get weakly\n\nattracted to a magnet.\n\nTABLE 5.3\n\nDiamagnetic Paramagnetic Ferromagnetic\n\n–1 ≤ χ < 0 0 < χ <  ε χ >> 1\n\n0 ≤ µ\nr\n < 1 1< µ\n\nr\n < 1+ ε µ\n\nr\n >> 1\n\nµ < µ\n0\n\nµ > µ\n0\n\nµ >> µ\n0\n\nFIGURE 5.12\nBehaviour of\n\nmagnetic field lines\nnear a\n\n(a) diamagnetic,\n\n(b) paramagnetic\nsubstance.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nMagnetism and\n\nMatter\n\n193\n\nThe individual atoms (or ions or molecules) of a paramagnetic material\npossess a permanent magnetic dipole moment of their own. On account\n\nof the ceaseless random thermal motion of the atoms, no net magnetisation\nis seen. In the presence of an external field B\n\n0\n, which is strong enough,\n\nand at low temperatures, the individual atomic dipole moment can be\n\nmade to align and point in the same direction as B\n0\n. Figure 5.12(b) shows\n\na bar of paramagnetic material placed in an external field. The field lines\ngets concentrated inside the material, and the field inside is enhanced. In\n\nmost cases, as is evident from Table 5.2, this enhancement is slight, being\none part in 10\n\n5\n. When placed in a non-uniform magnetic field, the bar\n\nwill tend to move from weak field to strong.\n\nSome paramagnetic materials are aluminium, sodium, calcium,\noxygen (at STP) and copper chloride. Experimentally, one finds that the\nmagnetisation of a paramagnetic material is inversely proportional to the\n\nabsolute temperature T ,\n\n0BM C\nT\n\n= [5.20(a)]\n\nor equivalently, using Eqs. (5.12) and (5.17)\n\n0C\nT\n\nµ\nχ = [5.20(b)]\n\nThis is known as Curie’s law, after its discoverer Pieree Curie (1859-\n1906). The constant C is called Curie’s constant. Thus, for a paramagnetic\n\nmaterial both χ and µ\nr\n depend not only on the material, but also\n\n(in a simple fashion) on the sample temperature. As the field is\nincreased or the temperature is lowered, the magnetisation increases until\n\nit reaches the saturation value M\ns\n, at which point all the dipoles are\n\nperfectly aligned with the field. Beyond this, Curie’s law [Eq. (5.20)] is no\nlonger valid.\n\n5.6.3  Ferromagnetism\n\nFerromagnetic substances are those which gets strongly magnetised when\nplaced in an external magnetic field. They have strong tendency to move\n\nfrom a region of weak magnetic field to strong magnetic field, i.e., they get\n\nstrongly attracted to a magnet.\nThe individual atoms (or ions or molecules) in a ferromagnetic material\n\npossess a dipole moment as in a paramagnetic material. However, they\ninteract with one another in such a way that they spontaneously align\nthemselves in a common direction over a macroscopic volume called\n\ndomain. The explanation of this cooperative effect requires quantum\nmechanics and is beyond the scope of this textbook. Each domain has a\nnet magnetisation. Typical domain size is 1mm and the domain contains\n\nabout 10\n11\n\n atoms. In the first instant, the magnetisation varies randomly\nfrom domain to domain and there is no bulk magnetisation. This is shown\nin Fig. 5.13(a). When we apply an external magnetic field B\n\n0\n, the domains\n\norient themselves in the direction of B\n0\n and simultaneously the domain\n\noriented in the direction of B\n0\n grow in size. This existence of domains and\n\ntheir motion in B\n0\n are not speculations. One may observe this under a\n\nmicroscope after sprinkling a liquid suspension of powdered\n\nFIGURE 5.13\n\n(a) Randomly\noriented domains,\n\n(b) Aligned domains.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n194  E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 5\n\n.1\n1\n\nferromagnetic substance of samples. This motion of suspension can be\nobserved. Figure 5.12(b) shows the situation when the domains have\n\naligned and amalgamated to form a single ‘giant’ domain.\n Thus, in a ferromagnetic material the field lines are highly\n\nconcentrated. In non-uniform magnetic field, the sample tends to move\n\ntowards the region of high field. We may wonder as to what happens\nwhen the external field is removed. In some ferromagnetic materials the\nmagnetisation persists. Such materials are called hard magnetic materials\n\nor hard ferromagnets. Alnico, an alloy of iron, aluminium, nickel, cobalt\nand copper, is one such material. The naturally occurring lodestone is\nanother. Such materials form permanent magnets to be used among other\n\nthings as a compass needle. On the other hand, there is a class of\nferromagnetic materials in which the magnetisation disappears on removal\nof the external field. Soft iron is one such material. Appropriately enough,\n\nsuch materials are called soft ferromagnetic materials. There are a number\nof elements, which are ferromagnetic: iron, cobalt, nickel, gadolinium,\netc. The relative magnetic permeability is >1000!\n\nThe ferromagnetic property depends on temperature. At high enough\ntemperature, a ferromagnet becomes a paramagnet. The domain structure\ndisintegrates with temperature. This disappearance of magnetisation with\n\ntemperature is gradual. It is a phase transition reminding us of the melting\nof a solid crystal. The temperature of transition from ferromagnetic to\nparamagnetism is called the Curie temperature T\n\nc\n. Table 5.4 lists\n\nthe Curie temperature of certain ferromagnets. The susceptibility\nabove the Curie temperature, i.e., in the paramagnetic phase is\ndescribed by,\n\n( )c\nc\n\nC\nT T\n\nT T\nχ = >\n\n− (5.21)\n\nTABLE 5.4 CURIE TEMPERATURE T\nC\n OF SOME\n\nFERROMAGNETIC MATERIALS\n\nMaterial       T\nc\n (K)\n\nCobalt       1394\n\nIron       1043\n\nFe\n2\nO\n\n3\n        893\n\nNickel         631\n\nGadolinium         317\n\nExample 5.11 A domain in ferromagnetic iron is in the form of a cube\nof side length 1µm.

Let the material be unmagnetised initially. We\nplace it in a solenoid and increase the current through the\nsolenoid. The magnetic field B in the material rises and\nsaturates as depicted in the curve Oa. This behaviour\nrepresents the alignment and merger of domains until no\nfurther enhancement is possible. It is pointless to increase\nthe current (and hence the magnetic intensity H ) beyond\nthis. Next, we decrease H and reduce it to zero. At H = 0, B\n≠ 0. This is represented by the curve ab. The value of B at\nH = 0 is called retentivity or remanence. In Fig. 5.14, B\n\nR\n ~\n\n1.2 T, where the subscript R denotes retentivity. The\ndomains are not completely randomised even though the\nexternal driving field has been removed. Next, the current\nin the solenoid is reversed and slowly increased. Certain\ndomains are flipped until the net field inside stands\nnullified. This is represented by the curve bc. The value of\nH at c is called coercivity. In Fig. 5.14 H\n\nc\n ~ –90 A m–1. As\n\nthe reversed current is increased in magnitude, we once\nagain obtain saturation. The curve cd depicts this. The\nsaturated magnetic field B\n\ns\n ~ 1.5 T. Next, the current is\n\nreduced (curve de) and reversed (curve ea). The cycle repeats\nitself. Note that the curve Oa does not retrace itself as H is reduced. For a\ngiven value of H, B is not unique but depends on previous history of the\nsample. This phenomenon is called hysterisis. The word hysterisis means\nlagging behind (and not ‘history’).\n\n5.7  PERMANENT MAGNETS AND ELECTROMAGNETS\nSubstances which at room temperature retain their ferromagnetic property\nfor a long period of time are called permanent magnets. Permanent\n\nFIGURE 5.14 The magnetic\nhysteresis loop is the B-H curve for\n\nferromagnetic materials.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n196\n\nmagnets can be made in a variety of ways. One can hold an\niron rod in the north-south direction and hammer it repeatedly.\n\nThe method is illustrated in Fig. 5.15. The illustration is from\na 400 year old book to emphasise that the making of\npermanent magnets is an old art. One can also hold a steel\n\nrod and stroke it with one end of a bar magnet a large number\nof times, always in the same sense to make a permanent\nmagnet.\n\nAn efficient way to make a permanent magnet is to place a\nferromagnetic rod in a solenoid and pass a current. The\nmagnetic field of the solenoid magnetises the rod.\n\nThe hysteresis curve (Fig. 5.14) allows us to select suitable\nmaterials for permanent magnets. The material should have\nhigh retentivity so that the magnet is strong and high coercivity\n\nso that the magnetisation is not erased by stray magnetic fields,\ntemperature fluctuations or minor mechanical damage.\nFurther, the material should have a high permeability. Steel is\n\none-favoured choice. It has a slightly smaller retentivity than\nsoft iron but this is outweighed by the much smaller coercivity\nof soft iron. Other suitable materials for permanent magnets\n\nare alnico, cobalt steel and ticonal.\nCore of electromagnets are made of ferromagnetic materials\n\nwhich have high permeability and low retentivity. Soft iron is a suitable\n\nmaterial for electromagnets. On placing a soft iron rod in a solenoid and\npassing a current, we increase the magnetism of the solenoid by a\nthousand fold. When we switch off the solenoid current, the magnetism is\n\neffectively switched off since the soft iron core has a low retentivity. The\narrangement is shown in Fig. 5.16.\n\nFIGURE 5.15 A blacksmith\n\nforging a permanent magnet by\nstriking a red-hot rod of iron\n\nkept in the north-south\n\ndirection with a hammer. The\nsketch is recreated from an\nillustration in De Magnete, a\n\nwork published in 1600 and\nauthored by William Gilbert,\nthe court physician to Queen\n\nElizabeth of England.\n\nFIGURE 5.16  A soft iron core in solenoid acts as an electromagnet.\n\nIn certain applications, the material goes through an ac cycle of\n\nmagnetisation for a long period. This is the case in transformer cores and\ntelephone diaphragms. The hysteresis curve of such materials must be\nnarrow. The energy dissipated and the heating will consequently be small.\n\nThe material must have a high resistivity to lower eddy current losses.\nYou will study about eddy currents in Chapter 6.\n\nElectromagnets are used in electric bells, loudspeakers and telephone\n\ndiaphragms. Giant electromagnets are used in cranes to lift machinery,\nand bulk quantities of iron and steel.\n\nIn\nd\n\nia\n’s\n\n \nM\n\na\ng\n\nn\ne\n\nti\nc\n \nF\n\nie\nld\n\n:\n\nh\ntt\np\n:/\n/w\n\nw\nw\n\n.i\nig\n\nm\n.r\ne\ns.\n\nin\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nMagnetism and\n\nMatter\n\n197\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. The science of magnetism is old. It has been known since ancient times\nthat magnetic materials tend to point in the north-south direction; like\n\nmagnetic poles repel and unlike ones attract; and cutting a bar magnet\n\nin two leads to two smaller magnets. Magnetic poles cannot be isolated.\n\n2. When a bar magnet of dipole moment m is placed in a uniform magnetic\nfield B,\n\n     (a) the force on it is zero,\n     (b) the torque on it is m × B,\n     (c) its potential energy is –m.B, where we choose the zero of energy at\n\nthe orientation when m is perpendicular to B.\n\n3. Consider a bar magnet of size l and magnetic moment m, at a distance\nr from its mid-point, where r >>l, the magnetic field B due to this bar\nis,\n\n0\n\n3\n2 r\n\nµ\n=\n\nπ\n\nm\nB     (along axis)\n\n   = 0\n3\n\n–\n4 r\n\nµ\nπ\n\nm\n    (along equator)\n\n4. Gauss’s law for magnetism states that the net magnetic flux through\nany closed surface is zero\n\n0φ\n\n∆\n\n= ∆ =∑\nS\n\nB SiB\nall area\nelements\n\n5. The earth’s magnetic field resembles that of a (hypothetical) magnetic\n\ndipole located at the centre of the earth. The pole near the geographic\n\nnorth pole of the earth is called the north magnetic pole. Similarly, the\n\npole near the geographic south pole is called the south magnetic pole.\n\nThis dipole is aligned making a small angle with the rotation axis of\nthe earth. The magnitude of the field on the earth’s surface  ≈  4 × 10–5 T.\n\nMAPPING INDIA’S MAGNETIC FIELD\n\nBecause of its practical application in prospecting, communication, and navigation, the\nmagnetic field of the earth is mapped by most nations with an accuracy comparable to\ngeographical mapping. In India over a dozen observatories exist, extending from\n\nTrivandrum (now Thrivuvananthapuram) in the south to Gulmarg in the north. These\nobservatories work under the aegis of the Indian Institute of Geomagnetism (IIG), in Colaba,\nMumbai. The IIG grew out of the Colaba and Alibag observatories and was formally\n\nestablished in 1971. The IIG monitors (via its nation-wide observatories), the geomagnetic\nfields and fluctuations on land, and under the ocean and in space. Its services are used\nby the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. (ONGC), the National Institute of\n\nOceanography (NIO) and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). It is a part of\nthe world-wide network which ceaselessly updates the geomagnetic data. Now India has\na permanent station called Gangotri.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n198\n\n6. Three quantities are needed to specify the magnetic field of the earth\n\non its surface – the horizontal component, the magnetic declination,\n\nand the magnetic dip. These are known as the elements of the earth’s\n\nmagnetic field.\n\n7. Consider a material placed in an external magnetic field B\n0\n. The\n\nmagnetic intensity is defined as,\n\n0\n\n0µ\n=\n\nB\nH\n\nThe magnetisation M of the material is its dipole moment per unit volume.\nThe magnetic field B in the material is,\n\n      B = µ\n0\n (H + M)\n\n8. For a linear material M = χ H. So that B = µ H and χ is called the\nmagnetic susceptibility of the material. The three quantities, χ, the\nrelative magnetic permeability µ\n\nr\n, and the magnetic permeability µ  are\n\nrelated as follows:\n\nµ = µ\n0\n µ\n\nr\n\n      µ\nr\n = 1+ χ\n\n9. Magnetic materials are broadly classified as: diamagnetic, paramagnetic,\n\nand ferromagnetic. For diamagnetic materials χ is negative and small\nand for paramagnetic materials it is positive and small. Ferromagnetic\n\nmaterials have large χ and are characterised by non-linear relation\nbetween B and H. They show the property of hysteresis.\n\n10. Substances, which at room temperature, retain their ferromagnetic\n\nproperty for a long period of time are called permanent magnets.\n\nPhysical quantity Symbol Nature Dimensions Units Remarks\n\nPermeability of µ\n0\n\nScalar [MLT\n–2\n\n A\n–2\n\n] T m A\n–1 µ\n\n0\n/4π = 10–7\n\nfree space\n\nMagnetic field, B Vector [MT\n–2\n\n A\n–1\n\n] T (tesla) 10\n4\n G (gauss) = 1 T\n\nMagnetic induction,\nMagnetic flux density\n\nMagnetic moment m Vector [L\n–2\n\n A] A m\n2\n\nMagnetic flux φ\nB\n\nScalar [ML\n2\nT\n\n–2\n A\n\n–1\n] W (weber) W = T m\n\n2\n\nMagnetisation M Vector [L\n–1\n\n A] A m\n–1\n\nMagnetic moment\n\nVolume\n\nMagnetic intensity H Vector [L\n–1\n\n A] A m\n–1\n\nB = µ\n0\n (H + M)\n\nMagnetic field\nstrength\n\nMagnetic χ Scalar - - M = χH\nsusceptibility\n\nRelative magnetic µ\nr\n\nScalar - - B = µ\n0 \n\nµ\nr\n H\n\npermeability\n\nMagnetic permeability µ Scalar [MLT–2 A–2] T m A–1 µ = µ\n0 \n\nµ\nr\n\nN A–2 B = µ H\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nMagnetism and\n\nMatter\n\n199\n\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n\n1. A satisfactory understanding of magnetic phenomenon in terms of moving\ncharges/currents was arrived at after 1800 AD. But technological\n\nexploitation of the directional properties of magnets predates this scientific\n\nunderstanding by two thousand years. Thus, scientific understanding is\n\nnot a necessary condition for engineering applications. Ideally, science\n\nand engineering go hand-in-hand, one leading and assisting the other in\n\ntandem.\n\n2. Magnetic monopoles do not exist. If you slice a magnet in half, you get\n\ntwo smaller magnets. On the other hand, isolated positive and negative\n\ncharges exist. There exists a smallest unit of charge, for example, the\nelectronic charge with value |e| = 1.6 ×10–19 C. All other charges are\n\nintegral multiples of this smallest unit charge. In other words, charge is\n\nquantised. We do not know why magnetic monopoles do not exist or why\n\nelectric charge is quantised.\n\n3. A consequence of the fact that magnetic monopoles do not exist is that\n\nthe magnetic field lines are continuous and form closed loops. In contrast,\n\nthe electrostatic lines of force begin on a positive charge and terminate\n\non the negative charge (or fade out at infinity).\n\n4. The earth’s magnetic field is not due to a huge bar magnet inside it. The\n\nearth’s core is hot and molten. Perhaps convective currents in this core\n\nare responsible for the earth’s magnetic field. As to what ‘dynamo’ effect\n\nsustains this current, and why the earth’s field reverses polarity every\nmillion years or so, we do not know.\n\n5. A miniscule difference in the value of χ, the magnetic susceptibility, yields\nradically different behaviour: diamagnetic versus paramagnetic. For\ndiamagnetic materials χ = –10–5 whereas χ = +10–5 for paramagnetic\nmaterials.\n\n6. There exists a perfect diamagnet, namely, a superconductor. This is a\nmetal at very low temperatures. In this case χ = –1, µ\n\nr\n = 0, µ = 0. The\n\nexternal magnetic field is totally expelled. Interestingly, this material is\n\nalso a perfect conductor. However, there exists no classical theory which\n\nties these two properties together. A quantum-mechanical theory by\n\nBardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer (BCS theory) explains these effects. The\n\nBCS theory was proposed in1957 and was eventually recognised by a Nobel\nPrize in physics in 1970.\n\n7. The phenomenon of magnetic hysteresis is reminiscent of similar\n\nbehaviour concerning the elastic properties of materials. Strain\nmay not be proportional to stress; here H and B (or M) are not\n\nlinearly related. The stress-strain curve exhibits hysteresis and\n\narea enclosed by it represents the energy dissipated per unit volume.\n\nA similar interpretation can be given to the B-H magnetic hysteresis\n\ncurve.\n\n8. Diamagnetism is universal. It is present in all materials. But it\n\nis weak and hard to detect if the substance is para- or ferromagnetic.\n\n9. We have classified materials as diamagnetic, paramagnetic, and\n\nferromagnetic. However, there exist additional types of magnetic material\n\nsuch as ferrimagnetic, anti-ferromagnetic, spin glass, etc. with properties\n\nwhich are exotic and mysterious.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n200\n\nEXERCISES\n\n5.1 Answer the following questions regarding earth’s magnetism:\n\n(a) A vector needs three quantities for its specification.

In the early decades of the nineteenth century,\nexperiments on electric current by Oersted, Ampere and a few others\n\nestablished the fact that electricity and magnetism are inter-related. They\nfound that moving electric charges produce magnetic fields. For example,\nan electric current deflects a magnetic compass needle placed in its vicinity.\n\nThis naturally raises the questions like: Is the converse effect possible?\nCan moving magnets produce electric currents? Does the nature permit\nsuch a relation between electricity and magnetism? The answer is\n\nresounding yes! The experiments of Michael Faraday in England and\nJoseph Henry in USA, conducted around 1830, demonstrated\nconclusively that electric currents were induced in closed coils when\n\nsubjected to changing magnetic fields. In this chapter, we will study the\nphenomena associated with changing magnetic fields and understand\nthe underlying principles. The phenomenon in which electric current is\n\ngenerated by varying magnetic fields is appropriately called\nelectromagnetic induction.\n\nWhen Faraday first made public his discovery that relative motion\n\nbetween a bar magnet and a wire loop produced a small current in the\nlatter, he was asked, “What is the use of it?” His reply was: “What is the\nuse of a new born baby?” The phenomenon of electromagnetic induction\n\nChapter Six\n\nELECTROMAGNETIC\n\nINDUCTION\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectromagnetic\n\nInduction\n\n205\n\nis not merely of theoretical or academic interest but also\nof practical utility. Imagine a world where there is no\nelectricity – no electric lights, no trains, no telephones and\nno personal computers. The pioneering experiments of\nFaraday and Henry have led directly to the development\nof modern day generators and transformers. Today’s\ncivilisation owes its progress to a great extent to the\ndiscovery of electromagnetic induction.\n\n6.2 THE EXPERIMENTS OF FARADAY AND\n\nHENRY\nThe discovery and understanding of electromagnetic\ninduction are based on a long series of experiments carried\nout by Faraday and Henry. We shall now describe some\nof these experiments.\n\nExperiment 6.1\n\nFigure 6.1 shows a coil C\n1\n* connected to a galvanometer\n\nG. When the North-pole of a bar magnet is pushed\ntowards the coil, the pointer in the galvanometer deflects,\nindicating  the presence of electric  current in the coil. The\ndeflection lasts as long as the bar magnet is in motion.\nThe galvanometer does not show any deflection when the\nmagnet is held stationary. When the magnet is pulled\naway from the coil, the galvanometer shows deflection in\nthe opposite direction, which indicates reversal of the\ncurrent’s direction. Moreover, when the South-pole of\nthe bar magnet is moved towards or away from the\ncoil, the deflections in the galvanometer are opposite\nto that observed with the North-pole for similar\nmovements. Further, the deflection (and hence current)\nis found to be larger when the magnet is pushed\ntowards or pulled away from the coil faster. Instead,\nwhen the bar magnet is held fixed and the coil C\n\n1\n is\n\nmoved towards or away from the magnet, the same\neffects are observed. It shows that it is the relative\nmotion between the magnet and the coil that is\n\nresponsible for generation (induction) of electric\n\ncurrent in the coil.\n\nExperiment 6.2\n\nIn Fig. 6.2 the bar magnet is replaced by a second coil\nC\n\n2\n connected to a battery. The steady current in the\n\ncoil C\n2\n produces a steady magnetic field. As coil C\n\n2\n is\n\n* Wherever the term ‘coil’ or ‘loop’ is used, it is assumed that they are made up of\n\nconducting material and are prepared using wires which are coated with insulating\n\nmaterial.\n\nFIGURE 6.1 When the bar magnet is\npushed towards the coil, the pointer in\n\nthe galvanometer G deflects.\n\nJosheph Henry [1797 –\n1878] American experimental\nphysicist, professor at\nPrinceton University and first\ndirector of the Smithsonian\nInstitution. He made important\nimprovements in electro-\nmagnets by winding coils of\ninsulated wire around iron\npole pieces and  invented an\nelectromagnetic motor and a\nnew, efficient telegraph. He\ndiscoverd self-induction and\ninvestigated how currents in\none circuit induce currents in\nanother.\n\nJ\nO\n\nS\nE\n\nP\nH\n\n H\nE\n\nN\nR\n\nY\n (1\n\n7\n9\n7\n –\n\n 1\n8\n7\n8\n)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n206\n\nmoved towards the coil C\n1\n, the galvanometer shows a\n\ndeflection. This indicates that electric current is induced in\ncoil C\n\n1\n. When C\n\n2\n is moved away, the galvanometer shows a\n\ndeflection again, but this time in the opposite direction. The\ndeflection lasts as long as coil C\n\n2\n is in motion. When the coil\n\nC\n2 \nis held fixed and C\n\n1\n is moved, the same effects are observed.\n\nAgain, it is the relative motion between the coils that induces\nthe electric current.\n\nExperiment 6.3\n\nThe above two experiments involved relative motion between\na magnet and a coil and between two coils, respectively.\nThrough another experiment, Faraday showed that this\nrelative motion is not an absolute requirement. Figure 6.3\nshows two coils C\n\n1\n and C\n\n2\n held stationary. Coil C\n\n1\n is connected\n\nto galvanometer G while the second coil C\n2\n is connected to a\n\nbattery through a tapping key K.\n\nFIGURE 6.2  Current is\ninduced in coil C\n\n1\n due to motion\n\nof the current carrying coil C\n2\n.\n\nFIGURE 6.3 Experimental set-up for Experiment 6.3.\n\nIt is observed that the galvanometer shows a momentary deflection\nwhen the tapping key K is pressed. The pointer in the galvanometer returns\nto zero immediately. If the key is held pressed continuously, there is no\ndeflection in the galvanometer. When the key is released, a momentory\ndeflection is observed again, but in the opposite direction. It is also observed\nthat the deflection increases dramatically when an iron rod is inserted\ninto the coils along their axis.\n\n6.3  MAGNETIC FLUX\nFaraday’s great insight lay in discovering a simple mathematical relation\nto explain the series of experiments he carried out on electromagnetic\ninduction. However, before we state and appreciate his laws, we must get\nfamiliar with the notion of magnetic flux, Φ \n\nB\n. Magnetic flux is defined in\n\nthe same way as electric flux is defined in Chapter 1. Magnetic flux through\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectromagnetic\n\nInduction\n\n207\n\na plane of area A placed in a uniform magnetic field B (Fig. 6.4) can\nbe written as\n\nΦ \nB\n  = B . A = BA cos θ (6.1)\n\nwhere θ   is angle between B and A. The notion of the area as a vector\nhas been discussed earlier in Chapter 1. Equation (6.1) can be\nextended to curved surfaces and nonuniform fields.\n\nIf the magnetic field has different magnitudes and directions at\nvarious parts of a surface as shown in Fig. 6.5, then the magnetic\nflux through the surface is given by\n\n1 1 2 2\nd dΦ = + +B A B A. .\n\nB\n... = B A.i id\n\nall\n\n∑ (6.2)\n\nwhere ‘all’ stands for summation over all the area elements dA\ni\n\ncomprising the surface and B\ni\n is the magnetic field at the area element\n\ndA\ni\n. The SI unit of magnetic flux is weber (Wb) or tesla meter\n\nsquared (T m\n2\n). Magnetic flux is a scalar quantity.\n\n6.4  FARADAY’S LAW OF INDUCTION\nFrom the experimental observations, Faraday arrived at a\n\nconclusion that an emf is induced in a coil when magnetic flux\n\nthrough the coil changes with time. Experimental observations\n\ndiscussed in Section 6.2 can be explained using this concept.\n\nThe motion of a magnet towards or away from coil C\n1\n in\n\nExperiment 6.1 and moving a current-carrying coil C\n2\n towards\n\nor away from coil C\n1\n in Experiment 6.2, change the magnetic\n\nflux associated with coil C\n1\n.  The change in magnetic flux induces\n\nemf in coil C\n1\n. It was this induced emf which caused electric\n\ncurrent to flow in coil C\n1 \n\nand through the galvanometer. A\n\nplausible explanation for the observations of Experiment 6.3 is\n\nas follows: When the tapping key K is pressed, the current in\n\ncoil C\n2\n (and the resulting magnetic field) rises from zero to a\n\nmaximum value in a short time. Consequently, the magnetic\n\nflux through the neighbouring coil C\n1\n also increases. It is the change in\n\nmagnetic flux through coil C\n1\n that produces an induced emf in coil C\n\n1\n.\n\nWhen the key is held pressed, current in coil C\n2\n is constant. Therefore,\n\nthere is no change in the magnetic flux through coil C\n1\n and the current in\n\ncoil C\n1\n drops to zero. When the key is released, the current in C\n\n2\n and the\n\nresulting magnetic field decreases from the maximum value to zero in a\n\nshort time. This results in a decrease in magnetic flux through coil C\n1\n\nand hence again induces an electric current in coil C\n1\n*. The common\n\npoint in all these observations is that the time rate of change of magnetic\n\nflux through a circuit induces emf in it. Faraday stated experimental\n\nobservations in the form of a law called Faraday’s law of electromagnetic\n\ninduction. The law is stated below.\n\nFIGURE 6.4 A plane of\nsurface area A placed in a\nuniform magnetic field B.\n\nFIGURE 6.5 Magnetic field B\ni\n\nat the i th area element. dA\ni\n\nrepresents area vector of the\ni th area element.\n\n* Note that sensitive electrical instruments in the vicinity of an electromagnet\ncan be damaged due to the induced emfs (and the resulting currents)  when the\n\nelectromagnet is turned on or off.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n208\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 6\n\n.1\n\nThe magnitude of the induced emf in a circuit is equal\nto the time rate of change of magnetic flux through the\n\ncircuit.\n\nMathematically, the induced emf is given by\n\nd\n–\n\nd\nB\n\nt\n\nΦ\nε = (6.3)\n\nThe negative sign indicates the direction of ε  and hence\nthe direction of current in a closed loop. This will be\ndiscussed in detail in the next section.\n\nIn the case of a closely wound coil of N turns, change\n\nof flux associated with each turn, is the same. Therefore,\nthe expression for the total induced emf is given by\n\nd\n–\n\nd\nBN\nt\n\nΦ\nε = (6.4)\n\nThe induced emf can be increased by increasing the\n\nnumber of turns N of a closed coil.\n\nFrom Eqs. (6.1) and (6.2), we see that the flux can be\nvaried by changing any one or more of the terms B, A and\nθ. In Experiments 6.1 and 6.2 in Section 6.2, the flux is\nchanged by varying B. The flux can also be altered by\nchanging the shape of a coil (that is, by shrinking it or\nstretching it) in a magnetic field, or rotating a coil in a\n\nmagnetic field such that the angle θ  between B and A\nchanges. In these cases too, an emf is induced in the\nrespective coils.\n\nExample 6.1  Consider Experiment 6.2. (a) What would you do to obtain\na large deflection of the galvanometer? (b) How would you demonstrate\nthe presence of an induced current in the absence of a galvanometer?\n\nSolution\n\n(a) To obtain a large deflection, one or more of the following steps can\nbe taken:  (i) Use a rod made of soft iron inside the coil C\n\n2\n, (ii) Connect\n\nthe coil to a powerful battery, and (iii) Move the arrangement rapidly\ntowards the test coil C\n\n1\n.\n\n(b) Replace the galvanometer by a small bulb, the kind one finds in a\n\nsmall torch light. The relative motion between the two coils will cause\nthe bulb to glow and thus demonstrate the presence of an induced\ncurrent.\n\nIn experimental physics one must learn to innovate. Michael Faraday\n\nwho is ranked as one of the best experimentalists ever, was legendary\n\nfor his innovative skills.\n\nExample 6.2 A square loop of side 10 cm and resistance 0.5 Ω is\nplaced vertically in the east-west  plane. A uniform magnetic field of\n0.10 T is set up across the plane in the north-east direction. The\nmagnetic field is decreased to zero in 0.70 s at a steady rate. Determine\n\nthe magnitudes of induced emf and current during this time-interval.\n\nMichael Faraday  [1791–\n1867] Faraday made\nnumerous contributions to\nscience, viz., the discovery\nof electromagnetic\ninduction, the laws of\nelectrolysis, benzene, and\nthe fact that the plane of\npolarisation is rotated in an\nelectric field. He is also\ncredited with the invention\nof the electric motor, the\nelectric generator and the\ntransformer. He is widely\nregarded as the greatest\nexperimental scientist of\nthe nineteenth century.\n\nM\nIC\n\nH\nA\n\nE\nL\n F\n\nA\nR\n\nA\nD\n\nA\nY\n (\n\n1\n7\n9\n1\n–\n1\n8\n6\n7\n)\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 6\n\n.2\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectromagnetic\n\nInduction\n\n209\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 6\n\n.2\n\nSolution The angle θ made by the area vector of the coil with the\nmagnetic field is 45\n\n°\n.

The statement of the law is:\n\nThe polarity of induced emf is such that it tends to produce a current\n\nwhich opposes the change in magnetic flux that produced it.\n\nThe negative sign shown in Eq. (6.3) represents this effect. We can\n\nunderstand Lenz’s law by examining Experiment 6.1 in Section 6.2.1. In\n\nFig. 6.1, we see that the North-pole of a bar magnet is being pushed\n\ntowards the closed coil. As the North-pole of the bar magnet moves towards\n\nthe coil, the magnetic flux through the coil increases. Hence current is\n\ninduced in the coil in such a direction that it opposes the increase in flux.\n\nThis is possible only if the current in the coil is in a counter-clockwise\n\ndirection with respect to an observer situated on the side of the magnet.\n\nNote that magnetic moment associated with this current has North polarity\n\ntowards the North-pole of the approaching magnet. Similarly, if the North-\n\npole of the magnet is being withdrawn from the coil, the magnetic flux\n\nthrough the coil will decrease. To counter this decrease in magnetic flux,\n\nthe induced current in the coil flows in clockwise direction and its South-\n\npole faces the receding North-pole of the bar magnet. This would result in\n\nan attractive force which opposes the motion of the magnet and the\n\ncorresponding decrease in flux.\n\nWhat will happen if an open circuit is used in place of the closed loop\n\nin the above example? In this case too, an emf is induced across the open\n\nends of the circuit. The direction of the induced emf can be found\n\nusing Lenz’s law. Consider Figs. 6.6 (a) and (b). They provide an easier\n\nway to understand the direction of induced currents. Note that the\n\ndirection shown by  and  indicate the directions of the induced\n\ncurrents.\n\nA little reflection on this matter should convince us on the\n\ncorrectness of Lenz’s law. Suppose that the induced current was in\n\nthe direction opposite to the one depicted in Fig. 6.6(a). In that case,\n\nthe South-pole due to the induced current will face the approaching\n\nNorth-pole of the magnet. The bar magnet will then be attracted\n\ntowards the coil at an ever increasing acceleration. A gentle push on\n\nthe magnet will initiate the process and its velocity and kinetic energy\n\nwill continuously increase without expending any energy. If this can\n\nhappen, one could construct a perpetual-motion machine by a\n\nsuitable arrangement. This violates the law of conservation of energy\n\nand hence can not happen.\n\nNow consider the correct case shown in Fig. 6.6(a). In this situation,\n\nthe bar magnet experiences a repulsive force due to the induced\n\ncurrent. Therefore, a person has to do work in moving the magnet.\n\nWhere does the energy spent by the person go? This energy is\n\ndissipated by Joule heating produced by the induced current.\n\nFIGURE 6.6\n\nIllustration of\n\nLenz’s law.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectromagnetic\n\nInduction\n\n211\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 6\n\n.4\n\nExample 6.4\n\nFigure 6.7 shows planar loops of different shapes moving out of or\n\ninto a region of a magnetic field which is directed normal to the plane\nof the loop away from the reader. Determine the direction of induced\ncurrent in each loop using Lenz’s law.\n\nFIGURE 6.7\n\nSolution\n\n(i) The magnetic flux through the rectangular loop abcd increases,\ndue to the motion of the loop into the region of magnetic field, The\n\ninduced current must flow along the path bcdab so that it opposes\nthe increasing flux.\n\n(ii) Due to the outward motion, magnetic flux through the triangular\n\nloop abc decreases due to which the induced current flows along\nbacb, so as to oppose the change in flux.\n\n(iii) As the magnetic flux decreases due to motion of the irregular\n\nshaped loop abcd out of the region of magnetic field, the induced\ncurrent flows along cdabc, so as to oppose change in flux.\nNote that there are no induced current as long as the loops are\n\ncompletely inside or outside the region of the magnetic field.\n\nExample 6.5\n(a) A closed loop is held stationary in the magnetic field between the\n\nnorth and south poles of two permanent magnets held fixed. Can\nwe hope to generate current in the loop by using very strong\nmagnets?\n\n(b) A closed loop moves normal to the constant electric field between\nthe plates of a large capacitor. Is a current induced in the loop\n(i) when it is wholly inside the region between the capacitor plates\n(ii) when it is partially outside the plates of the capacitor? The\nelectric field is normal to the plane of the loop.\n\n(c) A rectangular loop and a circular loop are moving out of a uniform\nmagnetic field region (Fig. 6.8) to a field-free region with a constant\nvelocity v. In which loop do you expect the induced emf to be\nconstant during the passage out of the field region?

In the case of circular loop, the rate of change of\narea of the loop during its passage out of the field region is not\n\nconstant, hence induced emf will vary accordingly.\n(d) The polarity of plate ‘A’ will be positive with respect to plate ‘B’ in\n\nthe capacitor.\n\n6.6  MOTIONAL ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE\nLet us consider a straight conductor moving in a uniform and time-\nindependent magnetic field.  Figure 6.10 shows a rectangular conductor\nPQRS in which the conductor PQ is free to move. The rod PQ is moved\n\ntowards the left with a constant velocity v as\nshown in the figure. Assume that there is no\nloss of energy due to friction. PQRS forms a\n\nclosed circuit enclosing an area that changes\nas PQ moves. It is placed in a uniform magnetic\nfield B which is perpendicular to the plane of\n\nthis system. If the length RQ = x and RS = l, the\nmagnetic flux Φ\n\nB \nenclosed  by the loop PQRS\n\nwill be\n\nΦ\nB\n = Blx\n\nSince x is changing with time, the rate of change\nof flux Φ\n\nB \nwill induce an emf given by:\n\n( )– d d–\nd d\n\nB Blx\nt t\n\nΦ\nε = =\n\n   = \nd\n\n–\nd\n\nx\nBl Blv\n\nt\n= (6.5)\n\nFIGURE 6.10  The arm PQ is moved to the left\n\nside, thus decreasing the area of the\nrectangular loop. This movement\n\ninduces a current I as shown.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectromagnetic\n\nInduction\n\n213\n\nwhere we have used dx/dt = –v  which is the speed of the conductor PQ.\nThe induced emf Blv is called motional emf. Thus, we are able to produce\n\ninduced emf by moving a conductor instead of varying the magnetic field,\nthat is, by changing the magnetic flux enclosed by the circuit.\n\nIt is also possible to explain the motional emf expression in Eq. (6.5)\n\nby invoking the Lorentz force acting on the free charge carriers of conductor\nPQ. Consider any arbitrary charge q in the conductor PQ. When the rod\nmoves with speed v, the charge will also be moving with speed v in the\n\nmagnetic field B. The Lorentz force on this charge is qvB in magnitude,\nand its direction is towards Q. All charges experience the same force, in\nmagnitude and direction, irrespective of their position in the rod PQ.\n\nThe work done in moving the charge from P to Q is,\n\nW = qvBl\n\nSince emf is the work done per unit charge,\n\nW\n\nq\nε =\n\n    = Blv\n\nThis equation gives emf induced across the rod PQ and is identical\nto Eq. (6.5). We stress that our presentation is not wholly rigorous. But\nit does help us to understand the basis of Faraday’s law when\n\nthe conductor is moving in a uniform and time-independent\nmagnetic field.\n\nOn the other hand, it is not obvious how an emf is induced when a\n\nconductor is stationary and the magnetic field is changing – a fact which\nFaraday verified by numerous experiments. In the case of a stationary\nconductor, the force on its charges is given by\n\nF = q (E + v ××××× B) = qE (6.6)\n\nsince v = 0. Thus, any force on the charge must arise from the electric\nfield term E alone. Therefore, to explain the existence of induced emf or\ninduced current, we must assume that a time-varying magnetic field\ngenerates an electric field. However, we hasten to add that electric fields\nproduced by static electric charges have properties different from those\n\nproduced by time-varying magnetic fields. In Chapter 4, we learnt that\ncharges in motion (current) can exert force/torque on a stationary magnet.\nConversely, a bar magnet in motion (or more generally, a changing\n\nmagnetic field) can exert a force on the stationary charge. This is the\nfundamental significance of the Faraday’s discovery. Electricity and\nmagnetism are related.\n\nExample 6.6  A metallic rod of 1 m length is rotated with a frequency\n\nof 50 rev/s, with one end hinged at the centre and the other end at the\ncircumference of a circular metallic ring of radius 1 m, about an axis\npassing through the centre and perpendicular to the plane of the ring\n\n(Fig. 6.11). A constant and uniform magnetic field of 1 T parallel to the\naxis is present everywhere.

Thus, the\nresulting separation of charges produces an emf across the ends of\n\nthe rod. At a certain value of emf, there is no more flow of electrons\nand a steady state is reached. Using Eq. (6.5), the magnitude of the\nemf generated across a length dr of the rod as it moves at right angles\n\nto the magnetic field is given by\n\nd dBv rε = .

The potential difference across the resistor is then equal to the\n\ninduced emf and equals B × (rate of change of area of loop).

Now we shall explore this aspect further\n\nwith a concrete example.\nLet r be the resistance of movable arm PQ of the rectangular conductor\n\nshown in Fig. 6.10. We assume that the remaining arms QR, RS and SP\n\nhave negligible resistances compared to r. Thus, the overall resistance of\nthe rectangular loop is r and this does not change as PQ is moved. The\ncurrent I in the loop is,\n\nI\nr\n\nε\n=\n\n   = \nB l v\n\nr\n(6.7)\n\nOn account of the presence of the magnetic field, there will be a force\non the arm PQ. This force  I (l ××××× B), is directed outwards in the direction\nopposite to the velocity of the rod. The magnitude of this force is,\n\nF = I l B = \n2 2\n\nB l v\n\nr\nwhere we have used Eq. (6.7). Note that this force arises due to drift velocity\nof charges (responsible for current) along the rod and the consequent\nLorentz force acting on them.\n\nAlternatively, the arm PQ is being pushed with a constant speed v,\nthe power required to do this is,\n\nP F v=\n\n    =\n2 2 2\n\nB l v\n\nr\n(6.8)\n\nThe agent that does this work is mechanical.

The arm PQ of the rectangular\n\nconductor is moved from x = 0, outwards. The uniform magnetic field is\nperpendicular to the plane and extends from x = 0 to x = b and is zero\nfor x > b. Only the arm PQ possesses substantial resistance r. Consider\n\nthe situation when the arm PQ  is pulled outwards from x = 0 to x = 2b,\nand is then moved back to x = 0 with constant speed v. Obtain expressions\nfor the flux, the induced emf, the force necessary to pull the arm and the\n\npower dissipated as Joule heat.

Even when bulk pieces of conductors\n\nare subjected to changing magnetic flux, induced currents\nare produced in them. However, their flow patterns resemble\nswirling eddies in water. This effect was discovered by physicist\n\nFoucault (1819-1868) and these currents are called eddy\ncurrents.\n\nConsider the apparatus shown in Fig. 6.13. A copper plate\n\nis allowed to swing like a simple pendulum between the pole\npieces of a strong magnet. It is found that the motion is damped\nand in a little while the plate comes to a halt in the magnetic\n\nfield. We can explain this phenomenon on the basis of\nelectromagnetic induction. Magnetic flux associated with the\nplate keeps on changing as the plate moves in and out of the\n\nregion between magnetic poles. The flux change induces eddy\ncurrents in the plate.  Directions of eddy currents are opposite\nwhen the plate swings into the region between the poles and\n\nwhen it swings out of the region.\nIf rectangular slots are made in the copper plate as shown\n\nin Fig. 6.14, area available to the flow of eddy currents is less.\n\nThus, the pendulum plate with holes or slots reduces\nelectromagnetic damping and the plate swings more freely.\nNote that magnetic moments of the induced currents (which\n\noppose the motion) depend upon the area enclosed by the\ncurrents (recall equation m = IA in Chapter 4).\nThis fact is helpful in reducing eddy currents in the metallic\n\ncores of transformers, electric motors and other such devices in\nwhich a coil is  to be wound over metallic core. Eddy currents are\nundesirable since they heat up the core and dissipate electrical\n\nenergy in the form of heat. Eddy currents are minimised by using\nlaminations of metal to make a metal core. The laminations are\nseparated by an insulating material like lacquer. The plane of the\n\nlaminations must be arranged parallel to the magnetic field, so\nthat they cut across the eddy current paths. This arrangement\nreduces the strength of the eddy currents. Since the dissipation\n\nof electrical energy into heat depends on the square of the strength\nof electric current, heat loss is substantially reduced.\n\nEddy currents are used to advantage in certain applications like:\n\n(i) Magnetic braking in trains: Strong electromagnets are situated\nabove the rails in some electrically powered trains. When the\nelectromagnets are activated, the eddy currents induced in the\nrails oppose the motion of the train. As there are no mechanical\nlinkages, the braking effect is smooth.\n\n(ii) Electromagnetic damping: Certain galvanometers have a fixed\ncore made of nonmagnetic metallic material. When the coil\noscillates, the eddy currents generated in the core oppose the\nmotion and bring the coil to rest quickly.\n\nFIGURE 6.13 Eddy currents are\ngenerated in the copper plate,\n\nwhile entering\n\nand leaving the region of\nmagnetic field.\n\nFIGURE 6.14 Cutting slots\nin the copper plate reduces\n\nthe effect of eddy currents.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectromagnetic\n\nInduction\n\n219\n\n(iii) Induction furnace: Induction furnace can be used to produce high\ntemperatures and can be utilised to prepare alloys, by melting the\n\nconstituent metals. A high frequency alternating current is passed\nthrough a coil which surrounds the metals to be melted. The eddy\ncurrents generated in the metals produce high temperatures sufficient\n\nto melt it.\n(iv) Electric power meters: The shiny metal disc in the electric power meter\n\n(analogue type) rotates due to the eddy currents. Electric currents\n\nare induced in the disc by magnetic fields produced by sinusoidally\nvarying currents in a coil.\nYou can observe the rotating shiny disc in the power meter of your\n\nhouse.\n\nELECTROMAGNETIC DAMPING\n\nTake two hollow thin cylindrical pipes of equal internal diameters made of aluminium and\n\nPVC, respectively. Fix them vertically with clamps on retort stands. Take a small cylinderical\n\nmagnet having diameter slightly smaller than the inner diameter of the pipes and drop it\n\nthrough each pipe in such a way that the magnet does not touch the sides of the pipes\n\nduring its fall. You will observe that the magnet dropped through the PVC pipe takes the\n\nsame time to come out of the pipe as it would take when dropped through the same height\n\nwithout the pipe. Note the time it takes to come out of the pipe in each case. You will  see that\n\nthe magnet takes much longer time in the case of aluminium pipe. Why is it so? It is due to\n\nthe eddy currents that are generated in the aluminium pipe which oppose the change in\n\nmagnetic flux, i.e., the motion of the magnet. The retarding force due to the eddy currents\n\ninhibits the motion of the magnet. Such phenomena are referred to as electromagnetic damping.\n\nNote that eddy currents are not generated in PVC pipe as its material is an insulator whereas\n\naluminium is a conductor.\n\n6.9  INDUCTANCE\nAn electric current can be induced in a coil by flux change produced by\nanother coil in its vicinity or flux change produced by the same coil. These\n\ntwo situations are described separately in the next two sub-sections.\nHowever, in both the cases, the flux through a coil is proportional to the\ncurrent. That is,  Φ\n\nB\n α I.\n\nFurther, if the geometry of the coil does not vary with time then,\n\nd d\n\nd d\nB I\n\nt t\n\nΦ\n∝\n\nFor a closely wound coil of N turns, the same magnetic flux is linked\n\nwith all the turns. When the flux Φ\nB\n through the coil changes, each turn\n\ncontributes to the induced emf. Therefore, a term called flux linkage is\nused which is equal to NΦ\n\nB\n for a closely wound coil and in such a case\n\nNΦ\nB ∝  I\n\nThe constant of proportionality, in this relation, is called inductance.\nWe shall see that inductance depends only on the geometry of the coil\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n220\n\nand intrinsic material properties. This aspect is akin to capacitance which\nfor a parallel plate capacitor depends on the plate area and plate separation\n\n(geometry) and the dielectric constant K of the intervening medium\n(intrinsic material property).\n\nInductance is a scalar quantity. It has the dimensions of [M L2 T –2 A–2]\n\ngiven by the dimensions of flux divided by the dimensions of current. The\nSI unit of inductance is henry and is denoted by H. It is named in honour\nof Joseph Henry who discovered electromagnetic induction in USA,\n\nindependently of Faraday in England.\n\n6.9.1  Mutual inductance\n\nConsider Fig. 6.15 which shows two long co-axial solenoids each of length\nl. We denote the radius of the inner solenoid S\n\n1\n by r\n\n1\n and the number of\n\nturns per unit length by n\n1\n. The corresponding quantities for the outer\n\nsolenoid S\n2 \nare r\n\n2 \nand n\n\n2\n, respectively. Let N\n\n1\n and N\n\n2\n be the total number\n\nof turns of coils S\n1\n and S\n\n2\n, respectively.\n\nWhen a current I\n2\n is set up through S\n\n2\n, it in turn sets up a magnetic\n\nflux through S\n1\n. Let us denote it by Φ\n\n1\n. The corresponding flux linkage\n\nwith  solenoid S\n1\n is\n\nN\n1 1 12 2\n\nM IΦ = (6.9)\nM\n\n12\n is called the mutual inductance of solenoid S\n\n1\n with respect to\n\nsolenoid S\n2\n. It is also referred to as the coefficient of mutual induction.\n\nFor these simple co-axial solenoids it is possible to calculate M\n12\n\n. The\nmagnetic field due to the current I\n\n2 \nin S\n\n2\n is µ\n\n0\nn\n\n2\nI\n2\n.

This is a good\n\napproximation keeping in mind that the solenoid is long,\nimplying l  >> r\n\n2\n.\n\nWe now consider the reverse case. A current I\n1 \n\nis\n\npassed through the solenoid S\n1 \nand the flux linkage with\n\ncoil S\n2 \nis,\n\nN\n2\nΦ\n\n2\n = M\n\n21\n I\n\n1\n(6.12)\n\nM\n21\n\n is called the mutual inductance of solenoid S\n2\n with\n\nrespect to solenoid S\n1\n.\n\nThe flux due to the current I\n1\n in S\n\n1 \ncan be assumed to\n\nbe confined solely inside S\n1\n since the solenoids are very\n\nlong. Thus, flux linkage with solenoid S\n2\n is\n\n( ) ( ) ( )22 2 2 1 0 1 1N n l r n IΦ µ= π\n\nFIGURE 6.15 Two long co-axial\nsolenoids of same\n\nlength l.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectromagnetic\n\nInduction\n\n221\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 6\n\n.9\n\nwhere n\n2\nl is the total number of turns of S\n\n2\n.

(6.12), we get\n\nM\n12 \n\n= M\n21\n\n= M (say) (6.14)\n\nWe have demonstrated this equality for long co-axial solenoids.\n\nHowever, the relation is far more general. Note that if the inner solenoid\nwas much shorter than (and placed well inside) the outer solenoid, then\nwe could still have calculated the flux linkage N\n\n1\nΦ\n\n1\n because the inner\n\nsolenoid is effectively immersed in a uniform magnetic field due to the\nouter solenoid. In this case, the calculation of M\n\n12\n would be easy. However,\n\nit would be extremely difficult to calculate the flux linkage with the outer\n\nsolenoid as the magnetic field due to the inner solenoid would vary across\nthe length as well as cross section of the outer solenoid. Therefore, the\ncalculation of M\n\n21\n would also be extremely difficult in this case. The\n\nequality M\n12\n\n=M\n21\n\n is very useful in such situations.\nWe explained the above example with air as the medium within the\n\nsolenoids. Instead, if a medium of relative permeability µ\nr\n had been present,\n\nthe mutual inductance would be\n\nM =µ\nr \nµ\n\n0 \nn\n\n1\nn\n\n2\nπ r2\n\n1 \nl\n\nIt is also important to know that the mutual inductance of a pair of\ncoils, solenoids, etc., depends on their separation as well as their relative\norientation.\n\nExample 6.9 Two concentric circular coils, one of small radius r\n1\n and\n\nthe other of large radius r\n2\n, such that r\n\n1\n << r\n\n2\n,\n \n are placed co-axially\n\nwith centres coinciding. Obtain the mutual inductance of the\n\narrangement.\n\nSolution  Let a current I\n2\n flow through the outer circular coil. The\n\nfield at the centre of the coil is B\n2\n = µ\n\n0\nI\n2\n / 2r\n\n2\n. Since the other\n\nco-axially placed coil has a very small radius, B\n2\n may be considered\n\nconstant over its cross-sectional area. Hence,\nΦ\n\n1\n = πr 2\n\n1\nB\n\n2\n\n     \n\n2\n0 1\n\n2\n\n22\n\nr\nI\n\nr\n\nµ π\n=\n\n     = M\n12 \n\nI\n2\n\nThus,\n\n2\n0 1\n\n12\n\n22\n\nr\nM\n\nr\n\nµ π\n=\n\nFrom Eq.

However, we\n\ncan accept this value because r\n1 \n\n<< r\n2\n.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n222\n\nNow, let us recollect Experiment 6.3 in Section 6.2. In that experiment,\nemf is induced in coil C\n\n1\n wherever there was any change in current through\n\ncoil C\n2\n. Let Φ\n\n1\n be the flux through coil C\n\n1\n (say of N\n\n1\n turns) when current in\n\ncoil C\n2\n is I\n\n2\n.\n\nThen, from Eq. (6.9), we have\n\nN\n1\nΦ\n\n1\n = MI\n\n2\n\nFor currents varrying with time,\n\n( ) ( )1 1 2d d\nd d\n\nN MI\n\nt t\n\nΦ\n=\n\nSince induced emf in coil C\n1\n is given by\n\n( )1 1d\n–\n\nd\n\nN\n\nt\n\nΦ\nε1 =\n\nWe get,\n\n2d–\nd\n\nI\nM\n\nt\nε1 =\n\nIt shows that varying current in a coil can induce emf in a neighbouring\n\ncoil. The magnitude of the induced emf depends upon the rate of change\nof current and mutual inductance of the two coils.\n\n6.9.2  Self-inductance\n\nIn the previous sub-section, we considered the flux in one solenoid due\n\nto the current in the other.  It is also possible that emf is induced in a\nsingle isolated coil due to change of flux through the coil by means of\nvarying the current through the same coil. This phenomenon is called\n\nself-induction. In this case, flux linkage through a coil of N turns is\nproportional to the current through the coil and is expressed as\n\nBN IΦ ∝\n\nB LN IΦ = (6.15)\nwhere constant of proportionality L is called self-inductance of the coil. It\nis also called the coefficient of self-induction of the coil. When the current\nis varied, the flux linked with the coil also changes and an emf is induced\n\nin the coil. Using Eq. (6.15), the induced emf is given by\n\n( )Bd\n–\n\nd\n\nN\n\nt\n\nΦ\nε =\n\nd\n–\n\nd\n\nI\nL\n\nt\nε = (6.16)\n\nThus, the self-induced emf always opposes any change  (increase or\ndecrease) of current in the coil.\n\nIt is possible to calculate the self-inductance for circuits with simple\n\ngeometries. Let us calculate the self-inductance of a long solenoid of cross-\nsectional area A and length l, having n turns per unit length. The magnetic\nfield due to a current I flowing in the solenoid is B = µ\n\n0\n n I  (neglecting edge\n\neffects, as before). The total flux linked with the solenoid is\n\n( )( )( )0BN nl n I AΦ µ=\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectromagnetic\n\nInduction\n\n223\n\nIAln\n2\n\n0\nµ=\n\nwhere nl is the total number of turns. Thus, the self-inductance is,\n\nL\nI\n\nΒΝΦ=\n\n   2\n0n Alµ= (6.17)\n\nIf we fill the inside of the solenoid with a material of relative permeability\n\nµ\nr\n (for example soft iron, which has a high value of relative permeability),\n\nthen,\n\n2\n0rL n Alµ µ= (6.18)\n\nThe self-inductance of the coil depends on its geometry and on the\n\npermeability of the medium.\n\nThe self-induced emf is also called the back emf  as it opposes any\n\nchange in the current in a circuit. Physically, the self-inductance plays\n\nthe role of inertia. It is the electromagnetic analogue of mass in mechanics.\n\nSo, work needs to be done against the back emf (ε ) in establishing the\ncurrent. This work done is stored as magnetic potential energy. For the\n\ncurrent I at an instant in a circuit, the rate of work done is\n\nd\n\nd\n\nW\nI\n\nt\nε=\n\nIf we ignore the resistive losses and consider only inductive effect,\nthen using Eq. (6.16),\n\nd d\n\nd d\n\nW I\nL I\n\nt t\n=\n\nTotal amount of work done in establishing the current I is\n\nW W L I I\nI\n\n= =∫ ∫d d\n0\n\nThus, the energy required to build up the current I is,\n\n21\n\n2\nW LI= (6.19)\n\nThis expression reminds us of mv\n2\n/2 for the (mechanical) kinetic energy\n\nof a particle of mass m, and shows that L is analogous to m (i.e., L is\n\nelectrical inertia and opposes growth and decay of current in the circuit).\n\nConsider the general case of currents flowing simultaneously in two\n\nnearby coils. The flux linked with one coil will be the sum of two fluxes\n\nwhich exist independently. Equation (6.9) would be modified into\n\nN\n1 1 11 1 12 2\n\nM I M IΦ = +\n\nwhere M\n11\n\n represents inductance due to the same coil.\n\nTherefore, using Faraday’s law,\n\n1 2\n1 11 12\n\nd d\n\nd d\n\nI I\nM M\n\nt t\nε = − −\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n224\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 6\n\n.1\n0\n\nM\n11 \n\nis the self-inductance and is written as L\n1\n.

Equations (6.20) and (2.77) have been derived for special\ncases: a solenoid and a parallel plate capacitor, respectively. But they\nare general and valid for any region of space in which a magnetic field\n\nor/and an electric field exist.\n\n6.10  AC GENERATOR\nThe phenomenon of electromagnetic induction has been technologically\nexploited in many ways. An exceptionally important application is the\n\ngeneration of alternating currents (ac). The modern ac generator with a\ntypical output capacity of 100 MW is a highly evolved machine. In this\nsection, we shall describe the basic principles behind this machine. The\n\nYugoslav inventor Nicola Tesla is credited with the development of the\nmachine. As was pointed out in Section 6.3, one method to induce an emf\n\nIn\nte\n\nra\nc\nti\n\nv\ne\n a\n\nn\nim\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n o\nn\n\n a\nc\n g\n\ne\nn\n\ne\nra\n\nto\nr:\n\nh\ntt\np\n:/\n/m\n\nic\nro\n\n.m\na\ng\nn\ne\nt.\nfs\n\nu\n.e\n\nd\nu\n/e\n\nle\nc\ntr\no\nm\n\na\ng\n/j\na\nv\na\n/g\n\ne\nn\ne\nra\n\nto\nr/\na\nc\n.h\n\ntm\nl\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectromagnetic\n\nInduction\n\n225\n\nor current in a loop is through a change in the\nloop’s orientation or a change in its effective area.\n\nAs the coil rotates in a magnetic field B, the\neffective area of the loop (the face perpendicular\nto the field) is A cos θ, where θ is the angle\nbetween A and B. This method of producing a\nflux change is the principle of operation of a\nsimple ac generator. An ac generator converts\n\nmechanical energy into electrical energy.\nThe basic elements of an ac generator are\n\nshown in Fig. 6.16. It consists of a coil mounted\n\non a rotor shaft. The axis of rotation of the coil\nis perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic\nfield. The coil (called armature) is mechanically\n\nrotated in the  uniform magnetic field by some\nexternal means. The rotation of the coil causes\nthe magnetic flux through it to change, so an\n\nemf is induced in the coil. The ends of the coil\nare connected to an external circuit by means\nof slip rings and brushes.\n\nWhen the coil is rotated with a constant\nangular speed ω, the angle θ between the magnetic field vector B and the\narea vector A of the coil at any instant t is θ  = ωt (assuming θ = 0° at t = 0).\nAs a result, the effective area of the coil exposed to the magnetic field lines\nchanges with time, and from Eq. (6.1), the flux at any time t is\n\nΦ\nB\n = BA cos θ = BA cos ωt\n\nFrom Faraday’s law, the induced emf for the rotating coil of N turns is\nthen,\n\nd d\n– – (cos )\n\ndt d\nBN NBA t\n\nt\n\nΦ\nε ω= =\n\nThus, the instantaneous value of the emf is\n\nε ω ω= NBA sin t (6.21)\nwhere NBAω is the maximum value of the emf, which occurs when\nsin ωt = ±1. If we denote NBAω as ε\n\n0\n, then\n\nε = ε\n0\n sin ωt (6.22)\n\nSince the value of the sine fuction varies between +1 and –1, the sign, or\npolarity of the emf changes with time. Note from Fig. 6.17 that the emf\nhas its extremum value when θ = 90° or θ = 270°, as the change of flux is\ngreatest at these points.\n\nThe direction of the current changes periodically and therefore the current\nis called alternating current (ac). Since ω = 2πν, Eq (6.22) can be written as\n\nε = ε\n0\nsin 2π ν t (6.23)\n\nwhere ν is the frequency of revolution of the generator’s coil.\nNote that Eq. (6.22) and (6.23) give the instantaneous value of the emf\n\nand ε varies between +ε\n0\n and –ε\n\n0\n periodically. We shall learn how to\n\ndetermine the time-averaged value for the alternating voltage and current\nin the next chapter.\n\nFIGURE 6.16 AC Generator\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n226  E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 6\n\n.1\n1\n\nIn commercial generators, the mechanical energy required for rotation\n\nof the armature is provided by water falling from a height, for example,\nfrom dams. These are called hydro-electric generators. Alternatively, water\nis heated to produce steam using coal or other sources. The steam at\n\nhigh pressure produces the rotation of the armature. These are called\nthermal generators. Instead of coal, if a nuclear fuel is used, we get nuclear\npower generators. Modern day generators produce electric power as high\n\nas 500 MW, i.e., one can light up 5 million 100 W bulbs! In most\ngenerators, the coils are held stationary and it is the electromagnets which\nare rotated. The frequency of rotation is 50 Hz in India. In certain countries\n\nsuch as USA, it is 60 Hz.\n\nExample 6.11 Kamla peddles a stationary bicycle. The pedals of the\nbicycle are attached to a 100 turn coil of area 0.10 m2. The coil rotates\n\nat half a revolution per second and it is placed in a uniform magnetic\nfield of 0.01 T perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the coil. What is\nthe maximum voltage generated in the coil?\n\nSolution  Here ν = 0.5 Hz; N =100, A = 0.1 m2 and B = 0.01 T. Employing\nEq. (6.21)\n\nε0 = NBA (2 π ν)\n\n   = 100 × 0.01 × 0.1 × 2 × 3.14 × 0.5\n\n   = 0.314 V\n\nThe maximum voltage is 0.314 V.\n\nWe urge you to explore such alternative possibilities for power\n\ngeneration.\n\nFIGURE 6.17 An alternating emf is generated by a loop of wire rotating in a magnetic field.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectromagnetic\n\nInduction\n\n227\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. The magnetic flux through a surface of area A placed in a uniform magnetic\n\nfield B is defined as,\n\nΦ\nB\n = B.A = BA cos θ\n\nwhere θ is the angle between B and A.\n2. Faraday’s laws of induction imply that the emf induced in a coil of N\n\nturns is directly related to the rate of change of flux through it,\n\nBd\n\nd\nN\n\nt\n\nΦ\nε = −\n\nHere ΦΒ is the flux linked with one turn of the coil. If the circuit is\nclosed, a current I = ε/R is set up in it, where R is the resistance of the\ncircuit.\n\n3. Lenz’s law states that the polarity of the induced emf is such that it\n\ntends to produce a current which opposes the change in magnetic flux\n\nthat produces it. The negative sign in the expression for Faraday’s law\n\nindicates this fact.\n\n4. When a metal rod of length l is placed normal to a uniform magnetic\n\nfield B and moved with a velocity v perpendicular to the field, the\n\ninduced emf (called motional emf) across its ends is\n\nε = Bl v\n5. Changing magnetic fields can set up current loops in nearby metal\n\n(any conductor) bodies. They dissipate electrical energy as heat. Such\n\ncurrents are eddy currents.\n\n6. Inductance is the ratio of the flux-linkage to current. It is equal to NΦ/I.\n\nMIGRATION OF BIRDS\n\nThe migratory pattern of birds is one of the mysteries in the field of biology, and indeed all\nof science. For example, every winter birds from Siberia fly unerringly to water spots in the\nIndian subcontinent. There has been a suggestion that electromagnetic induction may\nprovide a clue to these migratory patterns. The earth’s magnetic field has existed throughout\nevolutionary history. It would be of great benefit to migratory birds to use this field to\ndetermine the direction. As far as we know birds contain no ferromagnetic material. So\nelectromagnetic induction seems to be the only reasonable mechanism to determine\ndirection. Consider the optimal case where the magnetic field B, the velocity of the bird v,\nand two relevant points of its anatomy separated by a distance l, all three are mutually\nperpendicular. From the formula for motional emf, Eq. (6.5),\n\nε = Blv\n\nTaking B = 4 × 10–5 T, l = 2 cm wide, and v = 10 m/s, we obtain\n\nε = 4 × 10–5 × 2 × 10–2 × 10 V = 8 × 10–6 V\n\n= 8 µV\nThis extremely small potential difference suggests that our hypothesis is of doubtful\n\nvalidity. Certain kinds of fish are able to detect small potential differences. However, in\nthese fish, special cells have been identified which detect small voltage differences. In birds\nno such cells have been identified. Thus, the migration patterns of birds continues to remain\na mystery.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n228\n\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n\n1. Electricity and magnetism are intimately related. In the early part of the\n\nnineteenth century, the experiments of Oersted, Ampere and others\n\nestablished that moving charges (currents) produce a magnetic field.\n\nSomewhat later, around 1830, the experiments of Faraday and Henry\n\ndemonstrated that a moving magnet can induce electric current.\n\n2. In a closed circuit, electric currents are induced so as to oppose the\n\nchanging magnetic flux. It is as per the law of conservation of energy.\n\nHowever, in case of an open circuit, an emf is induced across its ends.\n\nHow is it related to the flux change?\n\n3. The motional emf discussed in Section 6.5 can be argued independently\n\nfrom Faraday’s law using the Lorentz force on moving charges.

In an ac generator, mechanical energy is converted to electrical energy\n\nby virtue of electromagnetic induction. If coil of N turn and area A is\n\nrotated at ν revolutions per second in a uniform magnetic field B, then\nthe motional emf produced is\n\nε = NBA (2πν) sin (2πνt)\nwhere we have assumed that at time t = 0 s, the coil is perpendicular to\n\nthe field.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nElectromagnetic\n\nInduction\n\n229\n\nEXERCISES\n\n6.1 Predict the direction of induced current in the situations described\nby the following Figs. 6.18(a) to (f ).\n\neven if the charges are stationary [and the q (v × B) term of the Lorentz\n\nforce is not operative], an emf is nevertheless induced in the presence of a\n\ntime-varying magnetic field. Thus, moving charges in static field and static\n\ncharges in a time-varying field seem to be symmetric situation for\n\nFaraday’s law. This gives a tantalising hint on the relevance of the principle\n\nof relativity for Faraday’s law.\n\n4.

These currents do not change direction with time. But voltages\nand currents that vary with time are very common. The electric mains\nsupply in our homes and offices is a voltage that varies like a sine function\nwith time. Such a voltage is called alternating voltage (ac voltage) and\nthe current driven by it in a circuit is called the alternating current (ac\ncurrent)*. Today, most of the electrical devices we use require ac voltage.\nThis is mainly because most of the electrical energy sold by power\ncompanies is transmitted and distributed as alternating current. The main\nreason for preferring use of ac voltage over dc voltage is that ac voltages\ncan be easily and efficiently converted from one voltage to the other by\nmeans of transformers. Further, electrical energy can also be transmitted\neconomically over long distances. AC circuits exhibit characteristics which\nare exploited in many devices of daily use. For example, whenever we\ntune our radio to a favourite station, we are taking advantage of a special\nproperty of ac circuits – one of many that you will study in this chapter.\n\nChapter Seven\n\nALTERNATING\n\nCURRENT\n\n* The phrases ac voltage and ac current are contradictory and redundant,\nrespectively, since they mean, literally, alternating current voltage and alternating\n\ncurrent current. Still, the abbreviation ac to designate an electrical quantity\n\ndisplaying simple harmonic time dependance has become so universally accepted\n\nthat we follow others in its use. Further, voltage – another phrase commonly\n\nused means potential difference between two points.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n234\n\nN\nIC\n\nO\nL\nA\n\n T\nE\n\nS\nL\nA\n\n (\n1\n8\n5\n6\n –\n\n 1\n9\n\n4\n3\n\n)\n\nNicola Tesla  (1856 –\n1943) Serbian-American\nscientist, inventor and\n\ngenius. He conceived the\nidea of the rotating\nmagnetic field, which is the\n\nbasis of practically all\nalternating current\nmachinery, and which\n\nhelped usher in the age of\nelectric power. He also\ninvented among other\n\nthings the induction motor,\nthe polyphase system of ac\npower, and the high\n\nfrequency induction coil\n(the Tesla coil) used in radio\nand television sets and\n\nother electronic equipment.\nThe SI unit of magnetic field\nis named in his honour.\n\n7.2  AC VOLTAGE APPLIED TO A RESISTOR\nFigure 7.1 shows a resistor connected to a source ε of\nac voltage. The symbol for an ac source in a circuit\n\ndiagram is . We consider a source which produces\nsinusoidally varying potential difference across its\nterminals. Let this potential difference, also called ac\n\nvoltage, be given by\n\nsinmv v tω= (7.1)\nwhere v\n\nm\n is the amplitude of the oscillating potential\n\ndifference and ω  is its angular frequency.\n\nTo find the value of current through the resistor, we\n\napply Kirchhoff’s loop rule ε( )t =∑ 0 (refer to Section\n3.13), to the circuit shown in Fig. 7.1 to get\n\n=sinmv t i Rω\n\nor   sin\nmvi t\nR\n\nω=\n\nSince R is a constant, we can write this equation as\n\nsinmi i tω= (7.2)\nwhere the current amplitude i\n\nm\n is given by\n\nm\nm\n\nv\ni\n\nR\n= (7.3)\n\nEquation (7.3) is Ohm’s law, which for resistors, works equally\n\nwell for both ac and dc voltages. The voltage across a pure resistor\n\nand the current through it, given by Eqs. (7.1) and (7.2) are\n\nplotted as a function of time in Fig. 7.2. Note, in particular that\n\nboth v and i reach zero, minimum and maximum values at the\n\nsame time. Clearly, the voltage and current are in phase with\n\neach other.\n\nWe see that, like the applied voltage, the current varies\n\nsinusoidally and has corresponding positive and negative values\n\nduring each cycle. Thus, the sum of the instantaneous current\n\nvalues over one complete cycle is zero, and the average current\n\nis zero. The fact that the average current is zero, however, does\n\nFIGURE 7.1  AC voltage applied to a resistor.\n\nFIGURE 7.2 In a pure\nresistor, the voltage and\n\ncurrent are in phase.

Thus,\nhe came into conflict\n\nwith Thomas Alva Edison,\nan advocate of direct\ncurrent. Westinghouse\n\nwas convinced that the\ntechnology of alternating\ncurrent was the key to\n\nthe electrical future.\nHe founded the famous\nCompany named after him\n\nand enlisted the services\nof Nicola Tesla and\nother inventors in the\n\ndevelopment of alternating\ncurrent motors and\napparatus for the\n\ntransmission of high\ntension current, pioneering\nin large scale lighting.\n\nnot mean that the average power consumed is zero and\nthat there is no dissipation of electrical energy. As you\n\nknow, Joule heating is given by i2R and depends on i2\n\n(which is always positive whether i is positive or negative)\nand not on i. Thus, there is Joule heating and\n\ndissipation of electrical energy when an\nac current passes through a resistor.\nThe instantaneous power dissipated in the resistor is\n\n2 2 2\nsinmp i R i R tω= = (7.4)\n\nThe average value of p over a cycle is*\n\n2 2 2\nsinmp i R i R tω= < > = < >   [7.5(a)]\n\nwhere the bar over a letter (here, p) denotes its average\nvalue and <......> denotes taking average of the quantity\n\ninside the bracket. Since,  i2\nm \n\nand R are constants,\n\n2 2\nsinmp i R tω= < > [7.5(b)]\n\nUsing the trigonometric identity, sin2 ωt =\n1/2 (1– cos 2ωt ), we have < sin2 ωt > = (1/2) (1– < cos 2ωt >)\nand since < cos2ωt > = 0**, we have,\n\n2 1sin\n2\n\ntω< > =\n\nThus,\n\n21\n\n2\nmp i R= [7.5(c)]\n\nTo express ac power in the same form as dc power\n(P = I2R), a special value of current is defined and used.\nIt is called, root mean square (rms) or effective current\n\n(Fig. 7.3) and is denoted by I\nrms\n\n or I.\n\n* The average value of a function F (t ) over a period T is given by F t\nT\n\nF t t\n\nT\n\n( ) ( )= ∫\n1\n\n0\n\nd\n\n** < > = ∫ =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\uf8ef\n\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb\uf8fa\n\n= −[ ] =cos cos sin sin2 1 2 1 2\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n2 0 0\n\n0 0\n\nω ω\nω\n\nω ω\nωt\n\nT\nt dt\n\nT\n\nt\n\nT\nT\n\nTT\n\nFIGURE 7.3 The rms current I is related to the\n\npeak  current i\nm\n by I = / 2\n\nm\ni  = 0.707 i\n\nm\n.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n236\n\nIt is defined by\n\n2 21\n\n2 2\n\nm\nm\n\ni\nI i i= = =\n\n= 0.707 i\nm\n\n(7.6)\n\nIn terms of I, the average power, denoted by P is\n\n2 21\n\n2\nm\n\npP i R I R= = = (7.7)\n\nSimilarly, we define the rms voltage or effective voltage by\n\nV = \n2\n\nmv\n = 0.707 v\n\nm\n(7.8)\n\nFrom Eq.

This shows the advantage of\n\nintroducing the concept of rms values. In terms of rms values, the equation\nfor power [Eq. (7.7)] and relation between current and voltage in ac circuits\nare essentially the same as those for the dc case.\n\nIt is customary to measure and specify rms values for ac quantities. For\nexample, the household line voltage of 220 V is an rms value with a peak\nvoltage of\n\nv\nm\n = 2  V =  (1.414)(220 V) = 311 V\n\nIn fact, the I or rms current is the equivalent dc current that would\nproduce the same average power loss as the alternating current. Equation\n\n(7.7) can also be written as\nP = V2 / R = I V    (since V = I R )\n\nExample 7.1 A light  bulb is rated at 100W for a 220 V supply.

But this is not so in the case  of an inductor,\na capacitor or a combination  of these circuit elements. In order to show\n\nphase relationship between voltage and current\nin an ac circuit, we use the notion of phasors.\nThe analysis of an ac circuit is facilitated by the\n\nuse of a phasor diagram. A phasor* is a vector\nwhich rotates about the origin with angular\nspeed ω, as shown in Fig. 7.4. The vertical\ncomponents of phasors V and I represent the\nsinusoidally varying quantities v and i. The\nmagnitudes of phasors V and I represent  the\n\namplitudes or the peak values v\nm\n and i\n\nm\n of these\n\noscillating quantities. Figure 7.4(a) shows the\nvoltage and current phasors and their\n\nrelationship at time t\n1\n for the case of an ac source\n\nconnected to a resistor i.e., corresponding to the\ncircuit shown in Fig. 7.1. The projection of\n\nvoltage and current phasors on vertical axis, i.e., v\nm\n sinω t and i\n\nm\n sinω t,\n\nrespectively represent the value of voltage and current at that instant. As\nthey rotate with frequency ω, curves in Fig. 7.4(b) are generated.\nFrom Fig. 7.4(a) we see that phasors V and I for the case of a resistor are\nin the same direction. This is so for all times. This means that the phase\nangle between the voltage and the current is zero.\n\n7.4  AC VOLTAGE APPLIED TO AN INDUCTOR\nFigure 7.5 shows an ac source connected to an inductor. Usually,\ninductors have appreciable resistance in their windings, but we shall\n\nassume that this inductor has negligible resistance.\nThus, the circuit is a purely inductive ac circuit. Let\nthe voltage across the source be v = v\n\nm\n sinω t. Using\n\nthe Kirchhoff’s loop rule, ε ( )t =∑ 0 , and  since there\nis no resistor in the circuit,\n\nd\n0\n\nd\n\ni\nv L\n\nt\n− = (7.10)\n\nwhere the second term is the self-induced Faraday\nemf in the inductor; and L is the self-inductance of\n\nFIGURE 7.4 (a) A phasor diagram for the\ncircuit in Fig 7.1. (b) Graph of v and\n\ni versus ωt.\n\nFIGURE 7.5  An ac source\nconnected to an inductor.\n\n* Though voltage and current in ac circuit are represented by phasors – rotating\nvectors, they are not vectors themselves. They are scalar quantities. It so happens\n\nthat the amplitudes and phases of harmonically varying scalars combine\n\nmathematically in the same way as do the projections of rotating vectors of\n\ncorresponding magnitudes and directions. The rotating vectors that represent\n\nharmonically varying scalar quantities are introduced only to provide us with a\nsimple way of adding these quantities using a rule that we already know.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n238\n\nthe inductor. The negative sign follows from Lenz’s law (Chapter 6).\nCombining Eqs. (7.1) and (7.10), we have\n\nd\nsin\n\nd\nmvi v t\n\nt L L\nω= = (7.11)\n\nEquation (7.11) implies that the equation for i(t), the current as a\nfunction of time, must be such that its slope di/dt is a sinusoidally varying\n\nquantity, with the same phase as the source voltage and an amplitude\ngiven by v\n\nm\n/L. To obtain the current, we integrate di/dt with respect to\n\ntime:\n\nd\n\nd\nd d\n\ni\n\nt\nt\n\nv\n\nL\nt tm∫ ∫= sin( )ω\n\nand get,\n\ncos( ) constantm\nv\n\ni t\nL\n\n= − ω +\nω\n\nThe integration constant has the dimension of current and is time-\nindependent. Since the source has an emf which oscillates symmetrically\nabout zero, the current it sustains also oscillates symmetrically about\n\nzero, so that no constant or time-independent component of the current\nexists. Therefore, the integration constant is zero.\n\nUsing\n\n− = −\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\ncos( ) sinω ωt t\nπ\n2\n\n, we have\n\ni i tm= −\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\nsin ω\nπ\n2\n\n(7.12)\n\nwhere  \nm\n\nm\n\nv\ni\n\nL\n=\n\nω\nis the amplitude of the current. The quantity ω L is\n\nanalogous to the resistance and is called inductive reactance, denoted\nby X\n\nL\n:\n\nX\nL\n = ω L (7.13)\n\nThe amplitude of the current is, then\n\nm\nm\n\nL\n\nv\ni\n\nX\n= (7.14)\n\nThe dimension of inductive reactance is the same as that of resistance\nand its SI unit is ohm (Ω). The inductive reactance limits the current in a\npurely inductive circuit in the same way as the resistance limits the\ncurrent in a purely resistive circuit. The inductive reactance is directly\nproportional to the inductance and to the frequency of the current.\n\nA comparison of Eqs. (7.1) and (7.12) for the source voltage and the\ncurrent in an inductor shows that the current lags the voltage by π/2 or\none-quarter (1/4) cycle. Figure 7.6 (a) shows the voltage and the current\nphasors in the present case at instant t\n\n1\n. The current phasor I is π/2\n\nbehind the voltage phasor V. When rotated with frequency ω counter-\nclockwise, they generate the voltage and current given by Eqs. (7.1) and\n(7.12), respectively and as shown in Fig. 7.6(b).\n\nIn\nte\n\nra\nc\nti\n\nv\ne\n a\n\nn\nim\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n o\nn\n\n P\nh\n\na\ns\no\n\nr \nd\n\nia\ng\n\nra\nm\n\ns\n o\n\nf \na\nc\n c\n\nir\nc\nu\n\nit\ns\n c\n\no\nn\n\nta\nin\n\nin\ng\n\n, \nR\n\n, \nL\n, \n\nC\n a\n\nn\nd\n\n R\nL\nC\n\n s\ne\nri\n\ne\ns\n c\n\nir\nc\nu\n\nit\ns\n:\n\nh\ntt\np\n:/\n/w\n\nw\nw\n\n.a\nn\nim\n\na\nti\no\nn\ns.\n\np\nh\ny\nsi\n\nc\ns.\n\nu\nn\nsw\n\n.e\nd\nu\n.a\n\nu\n//\njw\n\n/A\nC\n\n.h\ntm\n\nl\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n239\n\nAlternating Current\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 7\n\n.2\n\nWe see that the current reaches its maximum value later than the\n\nvoltage by one-fourth of a period \nT\n\n4\n\n2\n=\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f0\uf8ef\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb\uf8fa\n\nπ/\nω\n\n.

As charge\n\naccumulates on the capacitor plates, the voltage\nacross them increases, opposing the current. That is,\na capacitor in a dc circuit will limit or oppose the\n\ncurrent as it charges. When the capacitor is fully\ncharged, the current in the circuit falls to zero.\n\nWhen the capacitor is connected to an ac source,\n\nas in Fig. 7.8, it limits or regulates the current, but\ndoes not completely prevent the flow of charge. The\ncapacitor is alternately charged and discharged as\n\nthe current reverses each half cycle. Let q  be the\ncharge on the capacitor at any time t. The instantaneous voltage v across\nthe capacitor is\n\nq\nv\n\nC\n= (7.15)\n\nFrom the Kirchhoff’s loop rule, the voltage across the source and the\ncapacitor are equal,\n\nsinm\nq\n\nv t\nC\n\nω =\n\nTo find the current, we use the relation \nd\n\nd\n\nq\ni\n\nt\n=\n\n( )d\nd\n\nsin cos( )m mi v C t C v t\nt\n\nω ω ω= =\n\nUsing the relation, cos( ) sinω ωt t= +\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\nπ\n2\n\n, we have\n\ni i tm= +\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\nsin ω\nπ\n2\n\n(7.16)\n\nwhere the amplitude of the oscillating current is i\nm\n = ω Cv\n\nm\n.

(b) Graph of v and i versus ωt.\n\nThe dimension of capacitive reactance is the\nsame as that of resistance and its SI unit is\n\nohm (Ω). The capacitive reactance limits the\namplitude of the current in a purely capacitive\ncircuit in the same way as the resistance limits\n\nthe current in a purely resistive circuit. But it\nis inversely proportional to the frequency and\nthe capacitance.\n\nA comparison of Eq. (7.16) with the\nequation of source voltage, Eq. (7.1) shows that\nthe current is π/2 ahead of voltage.\n\nFigure 7.9(a) shows the phasor diagram at an instant t\n1\n. Here the current\n\nphasor I is π/2 ahead of the voltage phasor V as they rotate\ncounterclockwise. Figure 7.9(b) shows the variation of voltage and current\n\nwith time. We see that the current reaches its maximum value earlier than\nthe voltage by one-fourth of a period.\n\nThe instantaneous power supplied to the capacitor is\n\np\nc\n = i v = i\n\nm\n cos(ωt)v\n\nm\n sin(ωt)\n\n    = i\nm\nv\n\nm\n cos(ωt) sin(ωt)\n\n    sin(2 )\n2\n\nm mi v tω= (7.19)\n\nSo, as in the case of an inductor, the average power\n\nsin(2 ) sin(2 ) 0\n2 2\n\nm m m m\nC\n\ni v i v\nP t tω ω= = =\n\nsince <sin (2ωt)> = 0 over a complete cycle. Figure 7.10 explains it in detail.\nThus, we see that in the case of an inductor, the current lags the voltage\nby π/2 and in the case of a capacitor, the current leads the voltage by π/2.\n\nExample 7.3 A lamp is connected in series with a capacitor. Predict\n\nyour observations for dc and ac connections. What happens in each\ncase if the capacitance of the capacitor is reduced?\n\nSolution When a dc source is connected to a capacitor, the capacitor\n\ngets charged and after charging no current flows in the circuit and\nthe lamp will not glow. There will be no change even if C is reduced.\nWith ac source, the capacitor offers capacitative reactance (1/ωC )\nand the current flows in the circuit. Consequently, the lamp will shine.\nReducing C will increase reactance and the lamp will shine less brightly\nthan before.\n\nExample 7.4 A 15.0 µF capacitor is connected to a 220 V, 50 Hz source.\nFind the capacitive reactance and the current (rms and peak) in the\ncircuit.

The glow of the light bulb (a) increases; (b)\n\ndecreases; (c) is unchanged, as the iron rod is inserted. Give your\n\nanswer with reasons.\n\nSolution  As the iron rod is inserted, the magnetic field inside the coil\n\nmagnetizes the iron increasing the magnetic field inside it. Hence,\n\nthe inductance of the coil increases. Consequently, the inductive\n\nreactance of the coil increases. As a result, a larger fraction of the\n\napplied ac voltage appears across the inductor, leaving less voltage\n\nacross the bulb. Therefore, the glow of the light bulb decreases.\n\n7.6  AC VOLTAGE APPLIED TO A SERIES  LCR CIRCUIT\nFigure 7.12 shows a series LCR circuit connected to an ac source ε. As\nusual, we take the voltage of the source to be v = v\n\nm \nsin ωt.\n\nIf q is the charge on the capacitor and i the\ncurrent, at time t, we have, from Kirchhoff’s loop\nrule:\n\nd\n\nd\n\ni q\nL i R v\n\nt C\n+ + = (7.20)\n\nWe want to determine the instantaneous\ncurrent i and its phase relationship to the applied\n\nalternating voltage v. We shall solve this problem\nby two methods. First, we use the technique of\nphasors and in the second method, we solve\n\nEq. (7.20) analytically to obtain the time–\ndependence of i .\n\nFIGURE 7.12 A series LCR circuit\nconnected to an ac source.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n245\n\nAlternating Current\n\n7.6.1  Phasor-diagram solution\n\nFrom the circuit shown in Fig. 7.12, we see that the resistor, inductor\nand capacitor are in series. Therefore, the ac current in each element is\nthe same at any time, having the same amplitude and phase. Let it be\n\ni = i\nm\n sin(ωt+φ ) (7.21)\n\nwhere φ is the phase difference between the voltage across the source and\nthe current in the circuit. On the basis of what we have learnt in the previous\n\nsections, we shall construct a phasor diagram for the present case.\nLet I be the phasor representing the current in the circuit as given by\n\nEq. (7.21). Further, let V\nL\n, V\n\nR\n, V\n\nC\n, and V represent the voltage across the\n\ninductor, resistor, capacitor and the source, respectively. From previous\nsection, we know that V\n\nR\n is parallel to I, V\n\nC\n is π/2\n\nbehind I and V\nL\n is  π/2 ahead of I. V\n\nL\n, V\n\nR\n, V\n\nC\n and I\n\nare shown in Fig. 7.13(a) with apppropriate phase-\nrelations.\n\nThe length of these phasors or the amplitude\n\nof V\nR\n, V\n\nC\n and V\n\nL\n are:\n\nv\nRm\n\n = i\nm\n\n R, v\nCm\n\n = i\nm\n\n X\nC\n,\n \nv\n\nLm \n=\n\n \ni\nm \n\nX\nL\n\n(7.22)\n\nThe voltage Equation (7.20) for the circuit can\n\nbe written as\n\nv\nL\n + v\n\nR\n + v\n\nC\n = v (7.23)\n\nThe phasor relation whose vertical component\n\ngives the above equation is\n\nV\nL\n + V\n\nR\n + V\n\nC\n = V (7.24)\n\nThis relation is represented in Fig. 7.13(b). Since\n\nV\nC\n  and V\n\nL\n are always along the same line and in\n\nopposite directions, they can be combined into a single phasor (V\nC\n + V\n\nL\n)\n\nwhich has a magnitude \uf8e6v\nCm\n\n – v\nLm\n\n\uf8e6. Since V is represented as the\nhypotenuse of a right-triangle whose sides are V\n\nR\n and (V\n\nC\n + V\n\nL\n), the\n\npythagorean theorem gives:\n\n( )22 2m Rm Cm Lmv v v v= + −\nSubstituting the values of v\n\nRm\n, v\n\nCm\n, and v\n\nLm\n from Eq.

(7.27)\n\ngives the phase angle. With these, Eq. (7.21) is completely specified.\nIf X\n\nC\n > X\n\nL\n, φ is positive and the circuit is predominantly capacitive.\n\nConsequently, the current in the circuit leads the source voltage. If\n\nX\nC\n < X\n\nL\n, φ is negative and the circuit is predominantly inductive.\n\nConsequently, the current in the circuit lags  the source voltage.\nFigure 7.15 shows the phasor diagram and variation of v and i with ω t\n\nfor the case X\nC\n > X\n\nL\n.\n\nThus, we have obtained the amplitude\nand phase of current for an LCR series circuit\n\nusing the technique of phasors. But this\nmethod of analysing ac circuits suffers from\ncertain disadvantages. First, the phasor\n\ndiagram say nothing about the initial\ncondition. One can take any arbitrary value\nof t (say, t\n\n1\n, as done throughout this chapter)\n\nand draw different phasors which show the\nrelative angle between different phasors.\nThe solution so obtained is called the\n\nsteady-state solution. This is not a general\nsolution. Additionally, we do have a\ntransient solution which exists even for\n\nv = 0. The general solution is the sum of the\ntransient solution and the steady-state\n\nsolution. After a sufficiently long time, the effects of the transient solution\n\ndie out and the behaviour of the circuit is described by the steady-state\nsolution.\n\n7.6.2  Analytical solution\n\nThe voltage equation for the circuit is\n\nd\n\nd\n\ni q\nL R i v\n\nt C\n+ + =\n\n                 = v\nm\n sin ωt\n\nWe know that i = dq/dt.

The phenomenon of resonance is common among systems\nthat have a tendency to oscillate at a particular frequency. This frequency\n\nis called the system’s natural frequency. If such a system is driven by an\nenergy source at a frequency that is near the natural frequency, the\namplitude of oscillation is found to be large. A familiar example of this\n\nphenomenon is a child on a swing. The swing has a natural frequency\nfor swinging back and forth like a pendulum. If the child pulls on the\nrope at regular intervals and the frequency of the pulls is almost the\n\nsame as the frequency of swinging, the amplitude of the swinging will be\nlarge (Chapter 14, Class XI).\n\nFor an RLC circuit driven with voltage of amplitude v\nm\n and frequency\n\nω, we found that the current amplitude is given by\n\n2 2( )\n\nm m\nm\n\nC L\n\nv v\ni\n\nZ R X X\n= =\n\n+ −\n\nwith X\nc\n = 1/ωC and X\n\nL\n = ω L . So if ω is varied, then at a particular frequency\n\nω\n0\n, X\n\nc\n = X\n\nL\n, and the impedance is minimum ( )2 20Z R R= + = . This\n\nfrequency is called the resonant frequency:\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\norc LX X L\n\nC\nω\n\nω\n= =\n\nor   0\n1\n\nLC\nω = (7.35)\n\nAt resonant frequency, the current amplitude is maximum; i\nm\n = v\n\nm\n/R.\n\nFigure 7.16 shows the variation of i\nm\n with ω  in\n\na RLC series circuit with L = 1.00 mH, C =\n\n1.00 nF for two values of R: (i) R = 100 Ω\nand (ii) R = 200 Ω. For the source applied v\n\nm\n =\n\n100 V. ω\n0\n for this case is \n\n1\n\nLC\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n\n = 1.00×106\n\nrad/s.\n\nWe see that the current amplitude is maximum\n\nat the resonant frequency. Since i\nm \n\n= v\nm \n\n/ R at\n\nresonance, the current amplitude for case (i) is\n\ntwice to that for case (ii).\n\nResonant circuits have a variety of\n\napplications, for example, in the tuning\n\nmechanism of a radio or a TV set. The antenna of\n\na radio accepts signals from many broadcasting\n\nstations. The signals picked up in the antenna acts as a source in the\n\ntuning circuit of the radio, so the circuit can be driven at many frequencies.\n\nFIGURE 7.16 Variation of i\nm\n with ω for two\n\ncases: (i) R = 100 Ω, (ii) R = 200 Ω,\nL = 1.00 mH.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n249\n\nAlternating Current\n\nBut to hear one particular radio station, we tune the radio. In tuning, we\nvary the capacitance of a capacitor in the tuning circuit such that the\n\nresonant frequency of the circuit becomes nearly equal to the frequency\nof the radio signal received. When this happens, the amplitude of the\ncurrent with the frequency of the signal of the particular radio station in\n\nthe circuit is maximum.\nIt is important to note that resonance phenomenon is exhibited by a\n\ncircuit only if both L and C are present in the circuit. Only then do the\n\nvoltages across L and C cancel each other (both being out of phase)\n\nand the current amplitude is v\nm\n/R, the total source voltage appearing\n\nacross R. This means that we cannot have resonance in a RL or\n\nRC circuit.\n\nSharpness of resonance\n\nThe amplitude of the current in the series LCR circuit is given by\n\ni\nv\n\nR L\nC\n\nm\nm=\n\n+ −\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n2\n\n2\n1\n\nω\nω\n\nand is maximum when \n0 1/ .L Cω ω= =  The maximum value is\n\nmax\n/m mi v R= .\n\nFor values of ω other than ω\n0\n, the amplitude of the current is less\n\nthan the maximum value. Suppose we choose a value of ω  for which the\n\ncurrent amplitude is 1/ 2  times its maximum value. At this value, the\n\npower dissipated by the circuit becomes half. From the curve in\nFig. (7.16), we see that there are two such values of ω, say, ω\n\n1\n and ω\n\n2\n,\n\none greater and the other smaller than ω\n0\n and symmetrical about ω\n\n0\n.

From Eq. (7.36), we see that if quality factor is large, i.e., R is low\nor L is large, the circuit is more selective.\n\nExample 7.6 A resistor of 200 Ω and a capacitor of 15.0 µF are\nconnected in series to a 220 V, 50 Hz ac source.

How to resolve this paradox?\nAs you have learnt in the text, the two voltages are not in the same\nphase. Therefore, they cannot be added like ordinary numbers. The\n\ntwo voltages are out of phase by ninety degrees. Therefore, the total\nof these voltages must be obtained using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n2 2\nR C R CV V V+ = +\n\n= 220 V\nThus, if the phase difference between two voltages is properly taken\n\ninto account, the total voltage across the resistor and the capacitor is\nequal to the voltage of the source.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n252  E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 7\n\n.7\n\n7.7  POWER IN AC CIRCUIT: THE POWER FACTOR\nWe have seen that a voltage v = v\n\nm\n sinωt applied to a series RLC circuit\n\ndrives a current in the circuit given by i = i\nm\n sin(ωt + φ) where\n\nm\nm\n\nv\ni\n\nZ\n=   and φ =\n\n−\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n−\ntan\n\n1 X X\n\nR\n\nC L\n\nTherefore, the instantaneous power p supplied by the source is\n\n( ) [ ]sin sin( )m mp v i v t i tω ω φ= = × +\n\n[ ]cos cos(2 )\n2\n\nm mv i tφ ω φ= − + (7.37)\n\nThe average power over a cycle is given by the average of the two terms in\nR.H.S. of Eq. (7.37). It is only the second term which is time-dependent.\nIts average is zero (the positive half of the cosine cancels the negative\n\nhalf). Therefore,\n\ncos\n2\n\nm mv iP φ= cos\n2 2\n\nm mv i φ=\n\ncosV I φ= [7.38(a)]\n\nThis can also be written as,\n\n2\ncosP I Z φ= [7.38(b)]\n\nSo, the average power dissipated depends not only on the voltage and\ncurrent but also on the cosine of the phase angle φ between them. The\nquantity cosφ is called the power factor. Let us discuss the following\ncases:\n\nCase (i) Resistive circuit: If the circuit contains only pure R, it is called\nresistive. In that case φ = 0, cos φ = 1. There is maximum power dissipation.\nCase (ii) Purely inductive or capacitive circuit: If the circuit contains\nonly an inductor or capacitor, we know that the phase difference between\n\nvoltage and current is π/2. Therefore, cos φ = 0, and no power is dissipated\neven though a current is flowing in the circuit. This current is sometimes\nreferred to as wattless current.\n\nCase (iii) LCR series circuit: In an LCR series circuit, power dissipated is\ngiven by Eq. (7.38) where φ = tan–1 (X\n\nc \n– X\n\nL \n)/ R. So,  φ may be non-zero  in\n\na RL or RC or RCL circuit. Even in such cases, power is dissipated only in\nthe resistor.\n\nCase (iv) Power dissipated at resonance in LCR circuit: At resonance\nX\n\nc\n – X\n\nL\n= 0, and φ = 0. Therefore, cosφ = 1 and P = I 2Z = I 2 R. That is,\n\nmaximum power is dissipated in a circuit (through R) at resonance.\n\nExample 7.7 (a) For circuits used for transporting electric power, a\nlow power factor implies large power loss in transmission. Explain.\n\n(b) Power factor can often be improved by the use of a capacitor of\n\nappropriate capacitance in the circuit.

But this will lead to large power loss\n(I2R) in transmission.\n\n(b)Suppose in a circuit, current I lags the voltage by an angle φ. Then\npower factor cosφ =R/Z.\nWe can improve the power factor (tending to 1) by making Z tend to R.\nLet us understand, with the help of a phasor diagram (Fig. 7.17) how\n\nthis can be achieved. Let us resolve I into two components. I\np\n along\n\nthe applied voltage V and I\nq\n perpendicular to the applied voltage. I\n\nq\n\nas you have learnt in Section 7.7, is called the wattless component\n\nsince corresponding to this component of current, there is no power\n\nloss. I\nP\n  is known as the power component because it is in phase with\n\nthe voltage and corresponds to power loss in the circuit.\n\nIt’s clear from this analysis that if we want to improve power factor,\n\nwe must completely neutralize the lagging wattless current I\nq\n by an\n\nequal leading wattless current I′\nq\n. This can be done by connecting a\n\ncapacitor of appropriate value in parallel so that I\nq\n and I′\n\nq\n cancel\n\neach other and P is effectively I\np\n V.\n\nExample 7.8 A sinusoidal voltage of peak value 283 V and frequency\n\n50 Hz is applied to a series LCR circuit in which\nR = 3 Ω, L = 25.48 mH, and C = 796 µF.

If she/he is carrying\n\nanything made of metal, the metal detector emits a sound. On what\n\nprinciple does this detector work?\n\nSolution  The metal detector works on the principle of resonance in\n\nac circuits. When you walk through a metal detector, you are,\n\nin fact, walking through a coil of many turns. The coil is connected to\n\na capacitor tuned so that the circuit is in resonance. When\n\nyou walk through with metal in your pocket, the impedance of the\n\ncircuit changes – resulting in significant change in current in the\n\ncircuit. This change in current is detected and the electronic circuitry\n\ncauses a sound to be emitted as an alarm.\n\n7.8  LC OSCILLATIONS\nWe know that a capacitor and an inductor can store electrical and\nmagnetic energy, respectively. When a capacitor (initially charged) is\n\nconnected to an inductor, the charge on the capacitor and\nthe current in the circuit exhibit the phenomenon of\nelectrical oscillations similar to oscillations in mechanical\n\nsystems (Chapter 14, Class XI).\nLet a capacitor be charged q\n\nm\n (at t = 0) and connected\n\nto an inductor as shown in Fig. 7.18.\n\nThe moment the circuit is completed, the charge on\nthe capacitor starts decreasing, giving rise to current in\nthe circuit. Let q and i be the charge and current in the\n\ncircuit at time t. Since  di/dt is positive, the induced emf\nin L will have polarity as shown, i.e., v\n\nb \n< v\n\na\n. According to\n\nKirchhoff’s loop rule,\n\nd\n0\n\nd\n\nq i\nL\n\nC t\n− = (7.39)\n\ni = – (dq/dt ) in the present case (as q decreases, i increases).\nTherefore, Eq. (7.39) becomes:\n\n2\n\n2\n\nd 1\n0\n\nd\n\nq\nq\n\nLCt\n+ = (7.40)\n\nThis equation has the form \n2\n\n2\n02\n\nd\n0\n\nd\n\nx\nx\n\nt\nω+ =  for a simple harmonic\n\noscillator. The charge on the capacitor, therefore, oscillates with a natural\nfrequency\n\n0\n\n1\n\nLC\nω = (7.41)\n\nand varies sinusoidally with time as\n\n( )0cosmq q tω φ= + (7.42)\nwhere q\n\nm\n is the maximum value of q and φ is a phase constant. Since\n\nq = q\nm\n at t = 0, we have  cos φ =1 or φ = 0. Therefore, in the present case,\n\nFIGURE 7.18 At the\ninstant shown, the current\n\nis increasing; so the\npolarity of induced emf in\nthe inductor is as shown.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n256\n\n0cos( )mq q tω= (7.43)\n\nThe current i\nq\n\nt\n= −\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\nd\n\nd\n is given by\n\n0sin( )mi i tω= (7.44)\n\nwhere 0m mi qω=\nLet us now try to visualise how this oscillation takes place in the\n\ncircuit.\nFigure 7.19(a) shows a capacitor with initial charge q\n\nm\n connected to\n\nan ideal inductor. The electrical energy stored in the charged capacitor is\n\n2\n1\n\n2\nm\n\nE\n\nq\nU\n\nC\n= . Since, there is no current in the circuit, energy in the inductor\n\nis zero. Thus, the total energy of LC circuit is,\n\n2\n1\n\n2\nm\n\nE\n\nq\nU U\n\nC\n= =\n\nFIGURE 7.19 The oscillations in an LC circuit are analogous to the oscillation of a\n\nblock at the end of a spring. The figure depicts one-half of a cycle.\n\nAt t = 0, the switch is closed and the capacitor starts to discharge\n\n[Fig. 7.19(b)]. As  the current increases, it sets up a magnetic field in the\n\ninductor and thereby, some energy gets stored in the inductor in the\n\nform of magnetic energy: U\nB\n = (1/2) Li2. As the current reaches its\n\nmaximum value i\nm\n, (at t = T/4) as in Fig. 7.19(c), all the energy is stored\n\nin the magnetic field: U\nB\n = (1/2) Li2\n\nm\n. You can easily check that the\n\nmaximum electrical energy equals the maximum magnetic energy. The\n\ncapacitor now has no charge and hence no energy. The current now\n\nstarts charging the  capacitor, as in Fig. 7.19(d). This process continues\n\ntill the capacitor is fully charged (at t = T/2) [Fig. 7.19(e)]. But it is charged\n\nwith a polarity opposite to its initial state in Fig. 7.19(a). The whole process\n\njust described will now repeat itself till the system reverts to its original\n\nstate. Thus, the energy in the system oscillates between the capacitor\n\nand the inductor.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n257\n\nAlternating Current\n\nThe LC oscillation is similar to the mechanical oscillation of a block\nattached to a spring. The lower part of each figure in Fig. 7.19 depicts\n\nthe corresponding stage of a mechanical system (a block attached to a\nspring). As noted earlier, for a block of a mass m oscillating with frequency\nω\n\n0\n, the equation is\n\n2\n2\n\n2 0\n\nd\n0\n\nd\n\nx\nx\n\nt\nω+ =\n\nHere, \n0 /k mω = , and k is the spring constant. So, x corresponds to q.\n\nIn case of a mechanical system F = ma = m (dv/dt) = m (d2x/dt2). For an\nelectrical system, ε = –L (di/dt ) = –L (d2q/dt2). Comparing these two\nequations, we see that L is analogous to mass m: L is a measure of\n\nresistance to change in current. In case of LC circuit, 0 1/ LCω =  and\n\nfor mass on a spring, \n0 /k mω = . So,  1/C is analogous to k. The constant\n\nk (=F/x) tells us the (external) force required to produce a unit\n\ndisplacement whereas 1/C (=V/q ) tells us the potential difference required\nto store a unit charge. Table 7.1 gives the analogy between mechanical\nand electrical quantities.\n\nTABLE 7.1 ANALOGIES BETWEEN MECHANICAL AND\nELECTRICAL QUANTITIES\n\nMechanical system Electrical system\n\nMass m Inductance L\n\nForce constant k Reciprocal capacitance\n1/C\n\nDisplacement x Charge q\n\nVelocity v = dx/dt Current i = dq/dt\n\nMechanical energy Electromagnetic energy\n\n2 21 1\n\n2 2\nE kx mv= +\n\n2\n21 1\n\n2 2\n\nq\nU L i\n\nC\n= +\n\nNote that the above discussion of LC oscillations is not realistic for two\n\nreasons:\n(i) Every inductor has some resistance.

It is radiated away from the system in the form\nof electromagnetic waves (discussed in the next chapter). In fact, radio\nand TV transmitters depend on this radiation.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n258\n\nTWO DIFFERENT PHENOMENA, SAME MATHEMATICAL TREATMENT\n\nYou may like to compare the treatment of a forced damped oscillator discussed in Section\n14.10 of Class XI physics textbook, with that of an LCR circuit when an ac voltage is\napplied in it.

Why it is\nso? Think!\n\n7.9  TRANSFORMERS\nFor many purposes, it is necessary to change (or transform) an alternating\n\nvoltage from one to another of greater or smaller value. This is done with\n\na device called transformer using the principle of mutual induction.\n\nA transformer consists of two sets of coils, insulated from each other.\n\nThey are wound on a soft-iron core, either one on top of the other as in\n\nFig. 7.20(a) or on separate limbs of the core as in Fig. 7.20(b). One of the\n\ncoils called the primary coil has N\np\n turns. The other coil is called the\n\nsecondary coil; it has N\ns\n turns. Often the primary coil is the input coil\n\nand the secondary coil is the output coil of the transformer.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n260\n\nWhen an alternating voltage is applied to the  primary, the resulting\ncurrent produces an alternating magnetic flux which links the secondary\n\nand induces an emf in it. The value of this emf depends on the number of\nturns in the secondary. We consider an ideal transformer in which the\nprimary has negligible resistance and all the flux in the core links both\n\nprimary and secondary windings. Let φ be the flux in each turn in the\ncore at time t due to current in the primary when a voltage v\n\np\n is applied\n\nto it.\n\nThen the induced emf or voltage ε\ns\n, in the secondary with N\n\ns\n turns is\n\nd\n\nd\ns sN\n\nt\n\nφ\nε = − (7.45)\n\nThe alternating flux φ also induces an emf, called back emf in the\nprimary. This is\n\nd\n\nd\np pN\n\nt\n\nφ\nε = − (7.46)\n\nBut ε\np\n = v\n\np\n. If this were not so, the primary current would be infinite\n\nsince the  primary has zero resistance (as assumed). If the secondary is\n\nan open circuit or the current taken from it is small, then to a good\napproximation\n\nε\ns\n = v\n\ns\n\nwhere  v\ns\n is the voltage across the secondary. Therefore, Eqs. (7.45) and\n\n(7.46) can be written as\n\ns s\n\nd\nv N\n\nd t\n\nφ\n= − [7.45(a)]\n\np p\n\nd\nv N\n\nd t\n\nφ\n= − [7.46(a)]\n\nFrom Eqs. [7.45 (a)] and [7.46 (a)], we have\n\ns s\n\np p\n\nv N\n\nv N\n= (7.47)\n\nFIGURE 7.20 Two arrangements for winding of primary and secondary coil in a transformer:\n(a) two coils on top of each other, (b) two coils on separate limbs of the core.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n261\n\nAlternating Current\n\nNote that the above relation has been obtained using three\nassumptions: (i) the primary resistance and current are small; (ii) the\n\nsame flux links both the primary and the secondary as very little flux\nescapes from the core, and (iii) the secondary current is small.\n\nIf the transformer is assumed to be 100% efficient (no energy losses),\n\nthe power input is equal to the power output, and since p = i v,\n\ni\np\nv\n\np\n = i\n\ns\nv\n\ns\n(7.48)\n\nAlthough some energy is always lost, this is a good approximation,\nsince a well designed transformer may have an efficiency of more than\n\n95%. Combining Eqs. (7.47) and (7.48), we have\n\np s s\n\ns p p\n\ni v N\n\ni v N\n= = (7.49)\n\nSince i and v both oscillate with the same frequency as the ac source,\nEq. (7.49) also gives the ratio of the amplitudes or rms values of\ncorresponding quantities.\n\nNow, we can see how a transformer affects the voltage and current.\nWe have:\n\nV\nN\n\nN\nVs\n\ns\n\np\n\np=\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f7    and  I\n\nN\n\nN\nIs\n\np\n\ns\n\np=\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7 (7.50)\n\nThat is, if the secondary coil has a greater number of turns than the\n\nprimary (N\ns\n > N\n\np\n), the voltage is stepped up (V\n\ns\n > V\n\np\n). This type of\n\narrangement is called a step-up transformer. However, in this arrangement,\nthere is less current in the secondary than in the primary (N\n\np\n/N\n\ns\n < 1 and I\n\ns\n\n< I\np\n). For example, if the primary coil of a transformer has 100 turns and\n\nthe secondary has 200 turns,  N\ns\n/N\n\np\n = 2 and N\n\np\n/N\n\ns\n=1/2. Thus, a 220V\n\ninput at 10A will step-up to 440 V output at 5.0 A.\n\nIf the secondary coil has less turns than the primary (N\ns\n < N\n\np\n), we\n\nhave a step-down transformer. In this case, V\ns\n < V\n\np\n and I\n\ns\n > I\n\np\n. That is, the\n\nvoltage is stepped down, or reduced, and the current is increased.\n\nThe equations obtained above apply to ideal transformers (without\nany energy losses). But in actual transformers, small energy losses do\noccur due to the following reasons:\n\n(i) Flux Leakage: There is always some flux leakage; that is, not all of\nthe flux due to primary passes through the secondary due to poor\ndesign of the core or the air gaps in the core. It can be reduced by\n\nwinding the primary and secondary coils one over the other.\n\n(ii) Resistance of the windings: The wire used for the windings has some\n\nresistance and so, energy is lost due to heat produced in the wire\n(I 2R). In high current, low voltage windings, these are minimised by\nusing thick wire.\n\n(iii) Eddy currents: The alternating magnetic flux induces eddy currents\nin the iron core and causes heating. The effect is reduced by using a\nlaminated core.\n\n(iv) Hysteresis: The magnetisation of the core is repeatedly reversed by\nthe alternating magnetic field. The resulting expenditure of energy in\n\nthe core appears as heat and is kept to a minimum by using a magnetic\nmaterial which has a low hysteresis loss.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n262\n\nThe large scale transmission and distribution of electrical energy over\nlong distances is done with the use of transformers. The voltage output\n\nof the generator is stepped-up (so that current is reduced and\nconsequently, the I 2R loss is cut down). It is then transmitted over long\ndistances to an area sub-station near the consumers. There the voltage\n\nis stepped down. It is further stepped down at distributing sub-stations\nand utility poles before a power supply of 240 V reaches our homes.\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. An alternating voltage sin= ω\nm\n\nv v t  applied to a resistor R drives a\n\ncurrent i = i\nm\n sinωt in the resistor, \n\nm\nm\n\nv\ni\n\nR\n= . The current is in phase with\n\nthe applied voltage.\n\n2. For an alternating current i = i\nm\n sin ωt passing through a resistor R, the\n\naverage power loss P (averaged over a cycle) due to joule heating is\n( 1/2 )i\n\n2\nm\nR. To express it in the same form as the dc power (P = I\n\n2\nR), a\n\nspecial value of current is used. It is called root mean square (rms)\ncurrent and is donoted by I:\n\n0.707\n2\n\nm\nm\n\ni\nI i= =\n\nSimilarly, the rms voltage is defined by\n\n0.707\n2\n\nm\nm\n\nv\nV v= =\n\nWe have P = IV = I\n2\nR\n\n3. An ac voltage v = v\nm\n sin ωt applied to a pure inductor L, drives a current\n\nin the inductor i = i\nm\n sin (ωt – π/2), where i\n\nm\n = v\n\nm\n/X\n\nL\n. X\n\nL\n = ωL is called\n\ninductive reactance. The current in the inductor lags the voltage by\nπ/2. The average power supplied to an inductor over one complete cycle\nis zero.\n\n4. An ac voltage v = v\nm\n sinωt applied to a capacitor drives a current in the\n\ncapacitor: i = i\nm\n sin (ωt + π/2). Here,\n\n1\n,mm C\n\nC\n\nv\ni X\n\nX Cω\n= =  is called capacitive reactance.\n\nThe current through the capacitor is π/2 ahead of the applied voltage.\nAs in the case of inductor, the average power supplied to a capacitor\nover one complete cycle is zero.\n\n5. For a series RLC circuit driven by voltage v = v\nm\n sin ωt, the current is\n\ngiven by i = i\nm\n sin (ωt + φ )\n\nwhere\n\n( )22\nm\n\nm\n\nC L\n\nv\ni\n\nR X X\n=\n\n+ −\n\nand 1tan C L\nX X\n\nR\nφ −\n\n−\n=\n\n( )22 C LZ R X X= + −  is called the impedance of the circuit.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n263\n\nAlternating Current\n\nThe average power loss over a complete cycle is given by\n\nP = V I cosφ\nThe term cosφ is called the power factor.\n\n6. In a purely inductive or capacitive circuit, cosφ = 0 and no power is\ndissipated even though a current is flowing in the circuit. In such cases,\ncurrent is referred to as a wattless current.\n\n7. The phase relationship between current and voltage in an ac circuit\ncan be shown conveniently by representing voltage and current by\nrotating vectors called phasors. A phasor is a vector which rotates\nabout the origin with angular speed ω. The magnitude of a phasor\nrepresents the amplitude or peak value of the quantity (voltage or\ncurrent) represented by the phasor.\n\nThe analysis of an ac circuit is facilitated by the use of a phasor\ndiagram.\n\n8. An interesting characteristic of a series RLC circuit is the\nphenomenon of resonance. The circuit exhibits resonance, i.e.,\nthe amplitude of the current is maximum at the resonant\n\nfrequency, \n0\n\n1\n\nLC\nω = . The quality factor Q defined by\n\n0LQ\nR\n\nω\n=\n\n0\n\n1\n\nCRω\n=  is an indicator of the sharpness of the resonance,\n\nthe higher value of Q indicating sharper peak in the current.\n\n9. A circuit containing an inductor L and a capacitor C (initially\ncharged) with no ac source and no resistors exhibits free\noscillations. The charge q of the capacitor satisfies the equation\nof simple harmonic motion:\n\n2\n\n2\n\nd 1\n0\n\nq\nq\n\nLCdt\n+ =\n\nand therefore, the frequency ω of free oscillation is 0\n1\n\nLC\nω = . The\n\nenergy in the system oscillates between the capacitor and the\ninductor but their sum or the total energy is constant in time.\n\n10. A transformer consists of an iron core on which are bound a\nprimary coil of N\n\np\n turns and a secondary coil of N\n\ns\n turns. If the\n\nprimary coil is connected to an ac source, the primary and\nsecondary voltages are related by\n\nV\nN\n\nN\nVs\n\ns\n\np\n\np=\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f7\n\nand the currents are related by\n\nI\nN\n\nN\nIs\n\np\n\ns\n\np=\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\nIf the secondary coil has a greater number of turns than the primary, the\nvoltage is stepped-up (V\n\ns\n > V\n\np\n). This type of arrangement is called a step-\n\nup transformer. If the secondary coil has turns less than the primary, we\nhave a step-down transformer.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n264\n\n Physical quantity Symbol Dimensions Unit Remarks\n\nrms voltage V [M L\n2 \nT\n\n–3 \nA\n\n–1\n] V V = \n\n2\n\nmv\n, v\n\nm\n is the\n\namplitude of the ac voltage.\n\nrms current I [\n \nA] A I = \n\n2\n\nmi\n, i\n\nm\n is the amplitude of\n\nthe ac current.\n\nReactance:\n     Inductive X\n\nL\n[M\n\n \nL\n\n2 \nT\n\n–3 \nA\n\n–2\n] X\n\nL\n = ω L\n\n     Capacitive X\nC\n\n[M\n \nL\n\n2 \nT\n\n–3 \nA\n\n–2\n] X\n\nC\n = 1/ω C\n\nImpedance Z [M\n \nL\n\n2 \nT\n\n–3 \nA\n\n–2\n] Depends on elements\n\npresent in the circuit.\n\nResonant ω\nr\n or ω\n\n0\n[T\n\n–1\n] Hz ω\n\n0 \nLC\n\n1\n=  for a\n\nfrequency\nseries RLC circuit\n\nQuality factor Q Dimensionless\n0\n\n0\n\n1L\nQ\n\nR C R\n\nω\nω\n\n= =  for a series\n\nRLC circuit.\n\nPower factor Dimensionless = cosφ, φ is the phase\ndifference between voltage\napplied and current in\n\nthe circuit.\n\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n\n1. When a value is given for ac voltage or current, it is ordinarily the rms\n\nvalue. The voltage across the terminals of an outlet in your room is\n\nnormally 240 V. This refers to the rms value of the voltage. The amplitude\n\nof this voltage is\n\nV2 2(240) 340mv V= = =\n\n2. The power rating of an element used in ac circuits refers to its average\n\npower rating.\n\n3. The power consumed in an ac circuit is never negative.\n\n4. Both alternating current and direct current are measured in amperes.\n\nBut how is the ampere defined for an alternating current? It cannot be\n\nderived from the mutual attraction of two parallel wires carrying ac\n\ncurrents, as the dc ampere is derived. An ac current changes direction\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n265\n\nAlternating Current\n\nwith the source frequency and the attractive force would average to\n\nzero. Thus, the ac ampere must be defined in terms of some property\n\nthat is independent of the direction of the current. Joule heating\n\nis such a property, and there is one ampere of rms value of\n\nalternating current in a circuit if the current produces the same\n\naverage heating effect as one ampere of dc current would produce\n\nunder the same conditions.\n\n5. In an ac circuit, while adding voltages across different elements, one\n\nshould take care of their phases properly. For example, if V\nR\n and V\n\nC\n\nare voltages across R and C, respectively in an RC circuit, then the\n\ntotal voltage across RC combination is 2 2\nRC R CV V V= +  and not\n\nV\nR\n + V\n\nC\n since V\n\nC\n is π/2 out of phase of V\n\nR\n.\n\n6. Though in a phasor diagram, voltage and current are represented by\nvectors, these quantities are not really vectors themselves. They are\nscalar quantities. It so happens that the amplitudes and phases of\nharmonically varying scalars combine mathematically in the same\nway as do the projections of rotating vectors of corresponding\nmagnitudes and directions. The ‘rotating vectors’ that represent\nharmonically varying scalar quantities are introduced only to provide\nus with a simple way of adding these quantities using a rule that\nwe already know as the law of vector addition.\n\n7. There are no power losses associated with pure capacitances and pure\ninductances in an ac circuit. The only element that dissipates energy\nin an ac circuit is the resistive element.\n\n8. In a RLC circuit, resonance phenomenon occur when X\nL\n = X\n\nC\n or\n\n0\n\n1\n\nLC\nω = . For resonance to occur, the presence of both L and C\n\nelements in the circuit is a must. With only one of these (L or C )\nelements, there is no possibility of voltage cancellation and hence,\nno resonance is possible.\n\n9. The power factor in a RLC circuit is a measure of how close the\ncircuit is to expending the maximum power.\n\n10. In generators and motors, the roles of input and output are\nreversed. In a motor, electric energy is the input and mechanical\nenergy is the output. In a generator, mechanical energy is the\ninput and electric energy is the output. Both devices simply\ntransform energy from one form to another.\n\n11. A transformer (step-up) changes a low-voltage into a high-voltage.\nThis does not violate the law of conservation of energy. The\ncurrent is reduced by the same proportion.\n\n12. The choice of whether the description of an oscillatory motion is\nby means of sines or cosines or by their linear combinations is\nunimportant, since changing the zero-time position transforms\nthe one to the other.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n266\n\nEXERCISES\n\n7.1 A 100 Ω resistor is connected to a 220 V, 50 Hz ac supply.\n(a) What is the rms value of current in the circuit?\n(b) What is the net power consumed over a full cycle?\n\n7.2 (a) The peak voltage of an ac supply is 300 V.

Is the converse also true? Does an\nelectric field changing with time give rise to a magnetic field? James Clerk\nMaxwell (1831-1879), argued that this was indeed the case – not only\nan electric current but also a time-varying electric field generates magnetic\nfield. While applying the Ampere’s circuital law to find magnetic field at a\npoint outside a capacitor connected to a time-varying current, Maxwell\nnoticed an inconsistency in the Ampere’s circuital law. He suggested the\nexistence of an additional current, called by him, the displacement\ncurrent to remove this inconsistency.\n\nMaxwell formulated a set of equations involving electric and magnetic\nfields, and their sources, the charge and current densities. These\nequations are known as Maxwell’s equations. Together with the Lorentz\nforce formula (Chapter 4), they mathematically express all the basic laws\nof electromagnetism.\n\nThe most important prediction to emerge from Maxwell’s equations\nis the existence of electromagnetic waves, which are (coupled) time-\nvarying electric and magnetic fields that propagate in space. The speed\nof the waves,  according to these equations, turned out to be very close to\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n270\n\nthe speed of light( 3 ×108 m/s), obtained from optical\nmeasurements. This led to the remarkable conclusion\nthat light is an electromagnetic wave. Maxwell’s work\nthus unified the domain of electricity, magnetism and\nlight. Hertz, in 1885, experimentally demonstrated the\nexistence of electromagnetic waves. Its technological use\nby Marconi and others led in due course to the\nrevolution in communication that we are witnessing\ntoday.\n\nIn this chapter, we first discuss the need for\ndisplacement current and its consequences. Then we\npresent a descriptive account of electromagnetic waves.\nThe broad spectrum of electromagnetic waves,\nstretching from γ rays (wavelength ~10–12 m) to long\nradio waves (wavelength ~106 m) is described. How the\nelectromagnetic waves are sent and received for\ncommunication is discussed in Chapter 15.\n\n8.2  DISPLACEMENT CURRENT\nWe have seen in Chapter 4 that an electrical current\nproduces a magnetic field around it. Maxwell showed\nthat for logical consistency, a changing electric field must\nalso produce a magnetic field. This effect is of great\nimportance because it explains the existence of radio\nwaves, gamma rays and visible light, as well as all other\nforms of electromagnetic waves.\n\nTo see how a changing electric field gives rise to\na magnetic field, let us consider the process of\ncharging of a capacitor and apply Ampere’s circuital\nlaw given by (Chapter 4)\n\n“B.dl = µ\n0 \n\ni (t )           (8.1)\n\nto find magnetic  field at a point outside the capacitor.\nFigure 8.1(a)  shows a parallel plate capacitor C which\nis a part of circuit through which a time-dependent\ncurrent i (t ) flows . Let us find the magnetic field at a\npoint such as P, in a region outside the parallel plate\ncapacitor.  For this, we consider a plane circular loop of\nradius r whose plane is perpendicular to the direction\nof the current-carrying wire, and which is centred\nsymmetrically with respect to the wire [Fig. 8.1(a)]. From\nsymmetry, the magnetic field is directed along the\ncircumference of the circular loop and is the same in\nmagnitude at all points on the loop so that if B is the\nmagnitude of the field, the left side of Eq. (8.1) is B (2π r).\nSo we have\n\nB (2πr) = µ\n0\ni (t )    (8 .2)\n\nJ\nA\n\nM\nE\n\nS\n C\n\nL\nE\n\nR\nK\n\n M\nA\n\nX\nW\n\nE\nL\nL\n (\n1\n8\n3\n1\n–1\n\n8\n7\n9\n)\n\nJames Clerk Maxwell\n(1831 – 1879) Born in\nEdinburgh, Scotland,\nwas among the greatest\nphysicists of the\nnineteenth century. He\nderived the thermal\nvelocity distribution of\nmolecules in a gas and\nwas among the first to\nobtain reliable\nestimates of molecular\nparameters from\nmeasurable quantities\nlike viscosity, etc.\nMaxwell’s greatest\nacheivement was the\nunification of the laws of\nelectricity and\nmagnetism (discovered\nby Coulomb, Oersted,\nAmpere and Faraday)\ninto a consistent set of\nequations now called\nMaxwell’s equations.\nFrom these he arrived at\nthe most important\nconclusion that light is\nan electromagnetic\nwave. Interestingly,\nMaxwell did not agree\nwith the idea (strongly\nsuggested by the\nFaraday’s laws of\nelectrolysis) that\nelectricity was\nparticulate in nature.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n271\n\nElectromagnetic\n\nWaves\n\nNow, consider a different surface, which has the same boundary. This\nis a pot like surface [Fig. 8.1(b)] which nowhere touches the current, but\nhas its bottom between the capacitor plates; its mouth is the circular\nloop mentioned above. Another such surface is shaped like a tiffin box\n(without the lid) [Fig. 8.1(c)]. On applying Ampere’s circuital law to such\nsurfaces with the same perimeter, we find that the left hand side of\nEq. (8.1) has not changed but the right hand side is zero and not µ\n\n0\ni,\n\nsince no current passes through the surface of Fig. 8.1(b) and (c). So we\nhave a contradiction; calculated one way, there is a magnetic field at a\npoint P; calculated another way, the magnetic field at P is zero.\nSince the contradiction arises from our use of Ampere’s circuital law,\nthis law must be missing something. The missing term must be such\nthat one gets the same magnetic field at point P,  no matter what surface\nis used.\n\nWe can actually guess the missing term by looking carefully at\nFig. 8.1(c). Is there anything passing through the surface S between the\nplates of the capacitor? Yes, of course, the electric field! If the plates of the\ncapacitor have an area A, and a total charge Q, the magnitude of the\nelectric field E between the plates is (Q/A)/ε\n\n0\n (see Eq. 2.41). The field is\n\nperpendicular to the surface S of Fig. 8.1(c). It has the same magnitude\nover the area A of the capacitor plates, and vanishes outside it. So what\nis the electric flux Φ\n\nE\n through the surface S ? Using Gauss’s law, it is\n\nE\n0 0\n\n1\n= =\n\nQ Q\nA A\n\nA\nΦ\n\nε ε\n=E (8.3)\n\nNow if the charge Q on the capacitor plates changes with time, there is a\ncurrent i = (dQ/dt), so that using Eq. (8.3), we have\n\nd\nd\n\nd\nd\n\nd\nd\n\nΦE\nt t\n\nQ Q\n\nt\n=\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n=\nε ε0 0\n\n1\n\nThis implies that for consistency,\n\nε0\nd\nd\nΦE\nt\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n = i (8.4)\n\nThis is the missing term in Ampere’s circuital law. If we generalise\nthis law by adding to the total current carried by conductors through\nthe surface, another term which is ε\n\n0\n times the rate of change of electric\n\nflux through the same surface, the total has the same value of current i\nfor all surfaces. If this is done, there is no contradiction in the value of B\nobtained anywhere using the generalised Ampere’s law. B at the point P\nis non-zero no matter which surface is used for calculating it. B at a\npoint P outside the plates [Fig. 8.1(a)] is the same as at a point M just\ninside, as it should be. The current carried by conductors due to flow of\ncharges is called conduction current. The current, given by Eq. (8.4), is a\nnew term, and is due to changing electric field (or electric displacement,\nan old term still used sometimes). It is, therefore, called displacement\ncurrent or Maxwell’s displacement current. Figure 8.2 shows the electric\nand magnetic fields inside the parallel plate capacitor discussed above.\n\nThe generalisation made by Maxwell then is the following. The source\nof a magnetic field is not just the conduction electric current due to flowing\n\nFIGURE 8.1 A\nparallel plate\n\ncapacitor C, as part of\na circuit through\n\nwhich a time\ndependent current\n\ni (t) flows,  (a) a loop of\nradius r, to determine\n\nmagnetic field at a\npoint P on the loop;\n\n(b) a pot-shaped\nsurface passing\n\nthrough the interior\nbetween the capacitor\n\nplates with the loop\nshown in (a) as its\n\nrim; (c) a tiffin-\nshaped surface with\nthe circular loop as\n\nits rim and a flat\ncircular bottom S\n\nbetween the capacitor\nplates. The arrows\n\nshow uniform electric\nfield between the\ncapacitor plates.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n272\n\ncharges, but also the time rate of change of electric field. More\nprecisely, the total current i is the sum of the conduction current\ndenoted by i\n\nc\n, and the displacement current denoted by id (= ε0 (dΦE/\n\ndt)). So we have\n\n0\n\nd\nd\n\nE\nc d ci i i i\n\nt\n\nΦ\nε= + = + (8.5)\n\nIn explicit terms, this means that outside the capacitor plates,\nwe have only conduction current i\n\nc\n = i, and no displacement\n\ncurrent, i.e., i\nd\n = 0. On the other hand, inside the capacitor, there is\n\nno conduction current, i.e., ic = 0, and there is only displacement\ncurrent, so that i\n\nd\n = i.\n\nThe generalised (and correct) Ampere’s circuital law has the same\nform as Eq. (8.1), with one difference: “the total current passing\nthrough any surface of which the closed loop is the perimeter” is\nthe sum of the conduction current and the displacement current.\nThe generalised law is\n\nB liÑ d =\nd\nd\n\n0µ µ ε0 0i\nt\n\nc\nE+∫\n\nΦ\n(8.6)\n\nand is known as Ampere-Maxwell law.\nIn all respects, the displacement current has the same physical\n\neffects as the conduction current. In some cases, for example, steady\nelectric fields in a conducting wire, the displacement current may\nbe zero since the electric field E does not change with time. In other\ncases, for example, the charging capacitor above, both conduction\nand displacement currents may be present in different regions of\nspace. In most of the cases, they both may be present in the same\nregion of space, as there exist no perfectly conducting or perfectly\ninsulating medium. Most interestingly, there may be large regions\nof space where there is no conduction current, but there is only a\ndisplacement current due to time-varying electric fields. In such a\nregion, we expect a magnetic field, though there is no (conduction)\n\ncurrent source nearby! The prediction of such a displacement current\ncan be verified experimentally. For example, a magnetic field (say at point\nM) between the plates of the capacitor in Fig. 8.2(a) can be measured and\nis seen to be the same as that just outside (at P).\n\nThe displacement current has (literally) far reaching consequences.\nOne thing we immediately notice is that the laws of electricity and\nmagnetism are now more symmetrical*. Faraday’s law of induction states\nthat there is an induced emf equal to the rate of change of magnetic flux.\nNow, since the emf between two points 1 and 2 is the work done per unit\ncharge in taking it from 1 to 2, the existence of an emf implies the existence\nof an electric field. So, we can rephrase Faraday’s law of electromagnetic\ninduction by saying that a magnetic field, changing with time, gives rise\nto an electric field. Then, the fact that an electric field changing with\ntime gives rise to a magnetic field, is the symmetrical counterpart, and is\n\nFIGURE 8.2 (a) The\nelectric and magnetic\nfields E and B between\nthe capacitor plates, at\nthe point M. (b) A cross\nsectional view of Fig. (a).\n\n* They are still not perfectly symmetrical; there are no known sources of magnetic\nfield (magnetic monopoles) analogous to electric charges which are sources of\nelectric field.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n273\n\nElectromagnetic\n\nWaves\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\n\nE\n 8\n\n.1\n\na consequence of the displacement current being a source of a magnetic\nfield. Thus, time- dependent electric and magnetic fields give rise to each\nother! Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction and Ampere-Maxwell\nlaw give a quantitative expression of this statement, with the current\nbeing the total current, as in Eq. (8.5). One very important consequence\nof this symmetry is the existence of electromagnetic waves, which we\ndiscuss qualitatively in the next section.\n\nMAXWELL’S EQUATIONS IN VACUUM\n\n1.

Neither stationary charges\nnor charges in uniform motion (steady currents) can be sources of\nelectromagnetic waves. The former produces only electrostatic fields, while\nthe latter produces magnetic fields that, however, do not vary with time.\nIt is an important result of Maxwell’s theory that accelerated charges\nradiate electromagnetic waves. The proof of this basic result is beyond\nthe scope of this book, but we can accept it on the basis of rough,\nqualitative reasoning. Consider a charge oscillating with some frequency.\n(An oscillating charge is an example of accelerating charge.)   This\nproduces an oscillating electric field in space, which produces an oscillating\nmagnetic field, which in turn, is a source of oscillating electric field, and\nso on. The oscillating electric and magnetic fields thus regenerate each\nother, so to speak, as the wave propagates through the space.\nThe frequency of the electromagnetic wave naturally equals the\nfrequency of oscillation of the charge. The energy associated with the\npropagating wave comes at the expense of the energy of the source – the\naccelerated charge.\n\nFrom the preceding discussion, it might appear easy to test the\nprediction that light is an electromagnetic wave. We might think that all\nwe needed to do was to set up an ac circuit in which the current oscillate\nat the frequency of visible light, say, yellow light. But, alas, that is not\npossible. The frequency of yellow light is about 6 × 1014 Hz, while the\nfrequency that we get even with modern electronic circuits is hardly about\n1011 Hz. This is why the experimental demonstration of electromagnetic\nwave had to come in the low frequency region (the radio wave region), as\nin the Hertz’s experiment (1887).\n\nHertz’s successful experimental test of Maxwell’s theory created a\nsensation and sparked off other important works in this field. Two\nimportant achievements in this connection deserve mention.

It appears reasonable, say from our\ndiscussion of the displacement current. Consider\nFig. 8.2. The electric field inside the plates of the capacitor\nis directed perpendicular to the plates. The magnetic\nfield this gives rise to via the displacement current is\nalong the perimeter of a circle parallel to the capacitor\nplates. So B and E are perpendicular in this case. This\nis a general feature.\n\nIn Fig. 8.4, we show a typical example of a plane\nelectromagnetic wave propagating along the z direction\n(the fields are shown as a function of the z coordinate,\nat a given time t). The electric field E\n\nx\n is along the x-axis,\n\nand varies sinusoidally with z, at a given time. The\nmagnetic field B\n\ny\n is along the y-axis, and again varies\n\nsinusoidally with z. The electric and magnetic fields E\nx\n\nand B\ny\n are perpendicular to each other, and to the\n\ndirection z of propagation. We can write E\nx\n and B\n\ny\n as\n\nfollows:\n\nE\nx\n= E\n\n0\n sin (kz–ωt ) [8.7(a)]\n\nB\ny\n= B\n\n0\n sin (kz–ωt ) [8.7(b)]\n\nHere k is related to the wave length λ of the wave by the\nusual equation\n\n2\nk\n\nλ\nπ\n\n= (8.8)\n\nand ω   is the angular frequency.\nk is the magnitude of the wave\nvector (or propagation vector) k\nand its direction describes the\ndirection of propagation of the\nwave. The speed of propagation\nof the wave is (ω/k ). Using\nEqs. [8.7(a) and (b)] for E\n\nx\n and B\n\ny\n\nand Maxwell’s equations, one\nfinds that\n\nHeinrich Rudolf Hertz\n\n(1857 – 1894) German\nphysicist who was the\nfirst to broadcast and\nreceive radio waves. He\nproduced electro-\nmagnetic waves, sent\nthem through space, and\nmeasured their wave-\nlength and speed. He\nshowed that the nature\nof their vibration,\nreflection and refraction\nwas the same as that of\nlight and heat waves,\nestablishing their\nidentity for the first time.\nHe also pioneered\nresearch on discharge of\nelectricity through gases,\nand discovered the\nphotoelectric effect.\n\nH\nE\n\nIN\nR\n\nIC\nH\n\n R\nU\n\nD\nO\n\nL\nF\n H\n\nE\nR\n\nT\nZ\n (1\n\n8\n5\n7\n–1\n\n8\n9\n4\n)\n\nFIGURE 8.4 A linearly polarised electromagnetic wave,\npropagating in the z-direction with the oscillating electric field E\nalong the x-direction and the oscillating magnetic field B along\n\nthe y-direction.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n276\n\nω = ck, where, c = 1/ 0 0µ ε [8.9(a)]\nThe relation ω = ck is the standard one for waves (see for example,\n\nSection 15.4 of class XI Physics textbook).

They differ from all the other waves we have studied\nso far, in respect that no material medium is involved in the vibrations of\nthe electric and magnetic fields. Sound waves in air are longitudinal waves\nof compression and rarefaction. Transverse elastic (sound) waves can\nalso propagate in a solid, which is rigid and that resists shear. Scientists\nin the nineteenth century were so much used to this mechanical picture\nthat they thought that there must be some medium pervading all space\nand all matter, which responds to electric and magnetic fields just as any\nelastic medium does. They called this medium ether. They were so\nconvinced of the reality of this medium, that there is even a novel called\nThe Poison Belt by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (the creator of the famous\ndetective Sherlock Holmes) where the solar system is supposed to pass\nthrough a poisonous region of ether! We now accept that no such physical\nmedium is needed. The famous experiment of Michelson and Morley in\n1887 demolished conclusively the hypothesis of ether. Electric and\nmagnetic fields, oscillating in space and time, can sustain each other in\nvacuum.\n\nBut what if a material medium is actually there? We know that light,\nan electromagnetic wave, does propagate through glass, for example. We\nhave seen earlier that the total electric and magnetic fields inside a\nmedium are described in terms of a permittivity ε and a magnetic\npermeability µ (these describe the factors  by which the total fields differ\nfrom the external fields). These replace ε\n\n0\n and µ\n\n0\n in the description to\n\nelectric and magnetic fields in Maxwell’s equations with the result that in\na material medium of permittivity ε and magnetic permeability µ, the\nvelocity of light becomes,\n\n1\nv\n\nµε\n= (8.11)\n\nThus, the velocity of light depends on electric and magnetic properties of\nthe medium. We shall see in the next chapter that the refractive index of\none medium with respect to the other is equal to the ratio of velocities of\nlight in the two media.\n\nThe velocity of electromagnetic waves in free space or vacuum is an\nimportant fundamental constant. It has been shown by experiments on\nelectromagnetic waves of different wavelengths that this velocity is the\n\nS\nim\n\nu\nla\n\nte\n \np\n\nro\np\n\na\ng\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n \no\n\nf \ne\nle\n\nc\ntr\n\no\nm\n\na\ng\n\nn\ne\nti\n\nc\n \nw\n\na\nv\ne\ns\n\n(i\n)\n\nh\ntt\np\n:/\n/w\n\nw\nw\n\n.a\nm\n\na\nn\no\ng\na\nw\n\na\n.c\n\no\nm\n\n/w\na\nv\ne\ns.\n\nh\ntm\n\nl\n(i\ni)\n\nh\ntt\np\n:/\n/w\n\nw\nw\n\n.p\nh\ny\ns.\n\nh\na\nw\n\na\nii\n.e\n\nd\nu\n/~\n\nte\nb\n/j\na\nv\na\n/n\n\ntn\nu\nja\n\nv\na\n/e\n\nm\nW\n\na\nv\ne\n/e\n\nm\nW\n\na\nv\ne\n.h\n\ntm\nl\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n277\n\nElectromagnetic\n\nWaves\n\nsame (independent of wavelength) to within a few metres per second, out\nof a value of 3×108 m/s. The constancy of the velocity of em waves in\nvacuum is so strongly supported by experiments and the actual value is\nso well known now that this is used to define a standard of length.\nNamely, the metre is now defined as the distance travelled by light in\nvacuum in a time (1/c) seconds = (2.99792458 × 108)–1 seconds. This\nhas come about for the following reason. The basic unit of time can be\ndefined very accurately in terms of some atomic frequency, i.e., frequency\nof light emitted by an atom in a particular process. The basic unit of length\nis harder to define as accurately in a direct way. Earlier measurement of c\nusing earlier units of length (metre rods, etc.) converged to a value of about\n2.9979246 × 108 m/s. Since c is such a strongly fixed number, unit of\nlength can be defined in terms of c and the unit of time!\n\nHertz not only showed the existence of electromagnetic waves, but\nalso demonstrated that the waves, which had wavelength ten million times\nthat of the light waves, could be diffracted, refracted and polarised. Thus,\nhe conclusively established the wave nature of the radiation. Further, he\nproduced stationary electromagnetic waves and determined their\nwavelength by measuring the distance between two successive nodes.\nSince the frequency of the wave was known (being equal to the frequency\nof the oscillator), he obtained the speed of the wave using the formula\nv = νλ and found that the waves travelled with the same speed as the\nspeed of light.\n\nThe fact that electromagnetic waves are polarised can be easily seen\nin the response of a portable AM radio to a broadcasting station. If an\nAM radio has a telescopic antenna, it responds to the electric part of the\nsignal. When the antenna is turned horizontal, the signal will be greatly\ndiminished. Some portable radios have horizontal antenna (usually inside\nthe case of radio), which are sensitive to the magnetic component of the\nelectromagnetic wave. Such a radio must remain horizontal in order to\nreceive the signal. In such cases, response also depends on the orientation\nof the radio with respect to the station.\n\nDo electromagnetic waves carry energy and momentum like other\nwaves? Yes, they do. We have seen in chapter 2 that in a region of free\nspace with electric field E, there is an energy density (ε0E\n\n2/2). Similarly,\nas seen in Chapter 6, associated with a magnetic field B is a magnetic\nenergy density (B2/2µ\n\n0\n). As electromagnetic wave contains both electric\n\nand magnetic fields, there is a non-zero energy density associated with\nit. Now consider a plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation of\nthe electromagnetic wave (Fig. 8.4). If there are, on this plane, electric\ncharges, they will be set and sustained in motion by the electric and\nmagnetic fields of the electromagnetic wave. The charges thus acquire\nenergy and momentum from the waves. This just illustrates the fact that\nan electromagnetic wave (like other waves) carries energy and momentum.\nSince it carries momentum, an electromagnetic wave also exerts pressure,\ncalled radiation pressure.\nIf the total energy transferred to a surface in time t is U, it can be shown\nthat the magnitude of the total momentum delivered to this surface (for\ncomplete absorption) is,\n\nU\np\n\nc\n= (8.12)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n278  E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 8\n\n.3\n E\n\nX\nA\n\nM\nP\n\nL\nE\n 8\n\n.2\n\nWhen the sun shines on your hand, you feel the energy being\nabsorbed from the electromagnetic waves (your hands get warm).\nElectromagnetic waves also transfer momentum to your hand but\nbecause c is very large, the amount of momentum transferred is extremely\nsmall and you do not feel the pressure. In 1903, the American scientists\nNicols and Hull succeeded in measuring radiation pressure of\nvisible light and verified Eq. (8.12). It was found to be of the order of\n7 × 10–6 N/m2. Thus, on a surface of area 10 cm2, the force due to radiation\nis only about 7 × 10–9 N.\n\nThe great technological importance of electromagnetic waves stems\nfrom their capability to carry energy from one place to another. The\nradio and TV signals from broadcasting stations carry energy. Light\ncarries energy from the sun to the earth, thus making life possible on\nthe earth.\n\nExample 8.2 A plane electromagnetic wave of frequency\n25 MHz travels in free space along the x-direction.

Therefore, B should be in a direction\nperpendicular to both x- and y-axes. Using vector algebra, E × B should\nbe along  x-direction. Since, (+ ĵ ) × (+ k̂ ) = î , B is along the z-direction.\nThus, B = 2.1 × 10–8 k̂ T\n\nExample 8.3 The magnetic field in a plane electromagnetic wave is\ngiven by B\n\ny\n = (2 × 10–7) T sin (0.5×103x+1.5×1011t).\n\n(a) What is the wavelength and frequency of the wave?\n\n(b) Write an expression for the electric field.\n\nSolution\n\n(a) Comparing the given equation with\n\nB\ny\n = B0 sin \n\n2π\nλ\n\nx t\n\nT\n+\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ef\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8fb\n\uf8fa\n\nWe get, 3\n2\n\n0.5 10\nπ\n\nλ =\n×\n\n m = 1.26 cm,\n\nand   ( )111 1.5 10 /2 23.9 GHz\nT\n\nν= = × π =\n\n(b) E0 = B0c = 2×10\n–7 T × 3 × 108 m/s = 6 × 101 V/m\n\nThe electric field component is perpendicular to the direction of\npropagation and the direction of magnetic field.

The existence\nof ultraviolet and infrared waves was barely established. By the end of the\nnineteenth century, X-rays and gamma rays had also been discovered.  We\nnow know that, electromagnetic waves include visible light waves, X-rays,\ngamma rays, radio waves, microwaves, ultraviolet and infrared waves. The\nclassification of em waves according to frequency is the electromagnetic\nspectrum (Fig. 8.5). There is no sharp division between one kind of wave\nand the next. The classification is based roughly on how the waves are\nproduced and/or detected.\n\nFIGURE 8.5 The electromagnetic spectrum, with common names for various\npart of it. The various regions do not have sharply defined boundaries.\n\nE\nle\n\nc\ntr\n\no\nm\n\na\ng\n\nn\ne\nti\n\nc\n \ns\np\n\ne\nc\ntr\n\nu\nm\n\nh\ntt\np\n:/\n/w\n\nw\nw\n\n.f\nn\na\nl.\ng\no\nv\n/p\n\nu\nb\n/i\nn\nq\nu\nir\nin\n\ng\n/m\n\no\nre\n\n/l\nig\n\nh\nt\n\nh\ntt\np\n:/\n/i\nm\n\na\ng\nin\n\ne\n.g\n\nsf\nc\n.n\n\na\nsa\n\n.g\no\nv\n/d\n\no\nc\ns/\n\nsc\nie\n\nn\nc\ne\n/\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n281\n\nElectromagnetic\n\nWaves\n\nWe briefly describe these different types of electromagnetic waves, in\norder of decreasing wavelengths.\n\n8.4.1  Radio waves\n\nRadio waves are produced by the accelerated motion of charges in conducting\nwires. They are used in radio and television communication systems. They\nare generally in the frequency range from 500 kHz to about 1000 MHz.\nThe AM (amplitude modulated) band is from 530 kHz to 1710 kHz. Higher\nfrequencies upto 54 MHz are used for short wave bands. TV waves range\nfrom 54 MHz to 890 MHz. The FM (frequency modulated) radio band\nextends from 88 MHz to 108 MHz. Cellular phones use radio waves to\ntransmit voice communication in the ultrahigh frequency (UHF) band. How\nthese waves are transmitted and received is described in Chapter 15.\n\n8.4.2  Microwaves\n\nMicrowaves (short-wavelength radio waves), with frequencies in the\ngigahertz (GHz) range, are produced by special vacuum tubes (called\nklystrons, magnetrons and Gunn diodes). Due to their short wavelengths,\nthey are suitable for the radar systems used in aircraft navigation. Radar\nalso provides the basis for the speed guns used to time fast balls, tennis-\nserves, and automobiles. Microwave ovens are an interesting domestic\napplication of these waves. In such ovens, the frequency of the microwaves\nis selected to match the resonant frequency of water molecules so that\nenergy from the waves is transferred efficiently to the kinetic energy of\nthe molecules. This raises the temperature of any food containing water.\n\nMICROWAVE OVEN\n\nThe spectrum of electromagnetic radiation contains a part known as microwaves. These\nwaves have frequency and energy smaller than visible light and wavelength larger than it.\nWhat is the principle of a microwave oven and how does it work?\n\nOur objective is to cook food or warm it up. All food items such as fruit, vegetables,\nmeat, cereals, etc., contain water as a constituent. Now, what does it mean when we say that\na certain object has become warmer? When the temperature of a body rises, the energy of\nthe random motion of atoms and molecules increases and the molecules travel or vibrate or\nrotate with higher energies. The frequency of rotation of water molecules is about\n2.45 gigahertz (GHz). If water receives microwaves of this frequency, its molecules absorb\nthis radiation, which is equivalent to heating up water. These molecules share this energy\nwith neighbouring food molecules, heating up the food.\n\nOne should use porcelain vessels and not metal containers in a microwave oven because\nof the danger of getting a shock from accumulated electric charges. Metals may also melt\nfrom heating. The porcelain container remains unaffected and cool, because its large\nmolecules vibrate and rotate with much smaller frequencies, and thus cannot absorb\nmicrowaves. Hence, they do not get heated up.\n\nThus, the basic principle of a microwave oven is to generate microwave radiation of\nappropriate frequency in the working space of the oven where we keep food. This way\nenergy is not wasted in heating up the vessel. In the conventional heating method, the vessel\non the burner gets heated first, and then the food inside gets heated because of transfer of\nenergy from the vessel. In the microwave oven, on the other hand, energy is directly  delivered\nto water molecules which is shared by the entire food.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n282\n\n8.4.3 Infrared waves\n\nInfrared waves are produced by hot bodies and molecules. This band\nlies adjacent to the low-frequency or long-wave length end of the visible\nspectrum. Infrared waves are sometimes referred to as heat waves. This\nis because water molecules present in most materials readily absorb\ninfrared waves (many other molecules, for example, CO\n\n2\n, NH\n\n3\n, also absorb\n\ninfrared waves). After absorption, their thermal motion increases, that is,\nthey heat up and heat their surroundings. Infrared lamps are used in\nphysical therapy. Infrared radiation also plays an important role in\nmaintaining the earth’s warmth or average temperature through the\ngreenhouse effect. Incoming visible light (which passes relatively easily\nthrough the atmosphere) is absorbed by the earth’s surface and re-\nradiated as infrared (longer wavelength) radiations. This radiation is\ntrapped by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and water vapour.\nInfrared detectors are used in Earth satellites, both for military purposes\nand to observe growth of crops. Electronic devices (for example\nsemiconductor light emitting diodes) also   emit infrared and are widely\nused in the remote switches of household electronic systems such as TV\nsets, video recorders and hi-fi systems.\n\n8.4.4 Visible rays\n\nIt is the most familiar form of electromagnetic waves. It is the part of the\nspectrum that is detected by the human eye. It runs from about\n4 × 1014 Hz to about 7 × 1014 Hz or a wavelength range of about 700 –\n400 nm. Visible light emitted or reflected from objects around us provides\nus information about the world. Our eyes are sensitive to this range of\nwavelengths. Different animals are sensitive to different range of\nwavelengths. For example, snakes can detect infrared waves, and the\n‘visible’ range of many insects extends well into the utraviolet.\n\n8.4.5 Ultraviolet rays\n\nIt covers wavelengths ranging from about 4 × 10–7 m (400 nm) down to\n6 × 10–10m (0.6 nm). Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is produced by special\nlamps and very hot bodies. The sun is an important source of ultraviolet\nlight. But fortunately, most of it is absorbed in the ozone layer in the\natmosphere at an altitude of about 40 – 50 km. UV light in large quantities\nhas harmful effects on humans. Exposure to UV radiation induces the\nproduction of more melanin, causing tanning of the skin. UV radiation is\nabsorbed by ordinary glass. Hence, one cannot get tanned or sunburn\nthrough glass windows.\n\nWelders wear special glass goggles or face masks with glass windows\nto protect their eyes from large amount of UV produced by welding arcs.\nDue to its  shorter wavelengths, UV radiations  can be focussed into very\nnarrow beams for high precision applications such as  LASIK (Laser-\nassisted in situ keratomileusis) eye surgery. UV lamps are used to kill\ngerms  in water purifiers.\n\nOzone layer in the atmosphere plays a protective role, and hence its\ndepletion by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) gas (such as freon) is a matter\nof international concern.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n283\n\nElectromagnetic\n\nWaves\n\n8.4.6 X-rays\n\nBeyond the UV region of the electromagnetic spectrum lies the X-ray\nregion. We are familiar with X-rays because of its medical applications. It\ncovers wavelengths from about 10–8 m (10 nm) down to 10–13 m\n(10–4 nm). One common way to generate X-rays is to bombard a metal\ntarget by high energy electrons. X-rays are used as a diagnostic tool in\nmedicine and as a treatment for certain forms of cancer. Because X-rays\ndamage or destroy living tissues and organisms, care must be taken to\navoid unnecessary or over exposure.\n\n8.4.7 Gamma rays\n\nThey lie in the upper frequency range of the electromagnetic spectrum\nand have wavelengths of from about 10–10m to less than 10–14m. This\nhigh frequency radiation is produced in nuclear reactions and\nalso emitted by radioactive nuclei. They are used in medicine to destroy\ncancer cells.\n\nTable 8.1 summarises different types of electromagnetic waves, their\nproduction and detections. As mentioned earlier, the demarcation\nbetween different regions is not sharp and there are overlaps.\n\nTABLE 8.1 DIFFERENT TYPES OF ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES\n\nType Wavelength range Production Detection\n\nRadio > 0.1 m Rapid  acceleration and Receiver’s aerials\ndecelerations of electrons\nin aerials\n\nMicrowave 0.1m to 1 mm Klystron valve or Point contact diodes\nmagnetron valve\n\nInfra-red 1mm to 700 nm Vibration of atoms Thermopiles\nand molecules Bolometer, Infrared\n\nphotographic film\n\nLight 700 nm to 400 nm Electrons in atoms emit The eye\nlight when they move from Photocells\none energy level to a Photographic film\nlower energy level\n\nUltraviolet 400 nm to 1nm Inner shell electrons in Photocells\natoms moving from one Photographic film\nenergy level  to a lower level\n\nX-rays 1nm to 10–3 nm X-ray tubes or inner shell Photographic film\nelectrons Geiger tubes\n\nIonisation chamber\n\nGamma rays  <10–3 nm Radioactive decay of the -do-\nnucleus\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n284\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. Maxwell found an inconsistency in the Ampere’s law and suggested the\nexistence of an additional current, called displacement current, to remove\nthis inconsistency. This displacement current is due to time-varying electric\nfield and is given by\n\n0\nd\ndd\n\ni\nt\n\nΦ\nε Ε=\n\nand acts as a source of magnetic field in exactly the same way as conduction\ncurrent.\n\n2. An accelerating charge produces electromagnetic waves. An electric charge\noscillating harmonically with frequency ν, produces electromagnetic waves\nof the same frequency ν. An electric dipole is a basic source of\nelectromagnetic waves.\n\n3. Electromagnetic waves with wavelength of the order of a few metres were\nfirst produced and detected in the laboratory by Hertz in 1887. He thus\nverified a basic prediction of Maxwell’s equations.\n\n4. Electric and magnetic fields oscillate sinusoidally in space and time in an\nelectromagnetic wave. The oscillating electric and magnetic fields, E and\nB are perpendicular to each other, and to the direction of propagation of\nthe electromagnetic wave. For a wave of frequency ν, wavelength λ,\npropagating along z-direction, we have\n\nE\n \n = E\n\nx\n (t) = E0 sin (kz – ω t )\n\n   = E0 sin    \n2 20π π\n\nz\nt E\n\nz t\n\nTλ\nν\n\nλ\n−\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ef\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8fb\n\uf8fa = −\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ef\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8fb\n\uf8fasin\n\nB = B\ny\n(t) = B\n\n0\n sin (kz – ω t)\n\n   = B\nz\n\nt B\nz t\n\nT\n0 02 2sin sinπ π\n\nλ\nν\n\nλ\n−\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ef\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8fb\n\uf8fa = −\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ef\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8fb\n\uf8fa\n\nThey are related by E0/B0 = c.\n\n5. The speed c of electromagnetic wave in vacuum is related to µ\n0\n and ε\n\n0\n (the\n\nfree space permeability and permittivity constants) as follows:\n\n0 01/c µ ε= . The value of c equals the speed of light obtained from\n\noptical measurements.\n\nLight is an electromagnetic wave; c is, therefore, also the speed of light.\nElectromagnetic waves other than light also have the same velocity c in\nfree space.\n\nThe speed of light, or of electromagnetic waves in a material medium is\n\ngiven by 1/v µ ε=\n\nwhere µ is the permeability of the medium and ε its permittivity.\n6. Electromagnetic waves carry energy as they travel through space and this\n\nenergy is shared equally by the electric and magnetic fields.\n\nElectromagnetic waves transport momentum as well. When these waves\nstrike a surface, a pressure is exerted on the surface. If total energy\ntransferred to a surface in time t is U, total momentum delivered to this\nsurface is p = U/c.\n\n7. The spectrum of electromagnetic waves stretches, in principle, over an\ninfinite range of wavelengths. Different regions are known by different\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n285\n\nElectromagnetic\n\nWaves\n\nnames; γ-rays, X-rays, ultraviolet rays, visible rays, infrared rays,\nmicrowaves and radio waves in order of increasing wavelength  from 10–2 Å\nor 10–12 m to 106 m.\n\nThey interact with matter via their electric and magnetic fields which set\nin oscillation charges present in all matter. The detailed interaction and\nso the mechanism of absorption, scattering, etc., depend on the wavelength\nof the electromagnetic wave, and the nature of the atoms and molecules\nin the medium.\n\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n\n1. The basic difference between various types of electromagnetic waves\nlies in their wavelengths or frequencies since all of them travel through\nvacuum with the same speed. Consequently, the waves differ\nconsiderably in their mode of interaction with matter.\n\n2. Accelerated charged particles radiate electromagnetic waves. The\nwavelength of the electromagnetic wave is often correlated with the\ncharacteristic size of the system that radiates. Thus, gamma radiation,\nhaving wavelength of 10–14 m to 10–15 m, typically originate from an\natomic nucleus. X-rays are emitted from heavy atoms. Radio waves\nare produced by accelerating electrons in a circuit. A transmitting\nantenna can most efficiently radiate waves having a wavelength of\nabout the same size as the antenna. Visible radiation emitted by atoms\nis, however, much longer in wavelength than atomic size.\n\n3. The oscillating fields of an electromagnetic wave can accelerate charges\nand can produce oscillating currents. Therefore, an apparatus designed\nto detect electromagnetic waves is based on this fact. Hertz original\n‘receiver’ worked in exactly this way. The same basic principle is utilised\nin practically all modern receiving devices. High frequency\nelectromagnetic waves are detected by other means based on the\nphysical effects they produce on interacting with matter.\n\n4. Infrared waves, with frequencies lower than those of visible light,\nvibrate not only the electrons, but entire atoms or molecules of a\nsubstance. This vibration increases the internal energy and\nconsequently, the temperature of the substance. This is why infrared\nwaves are often called heat waves.\n\n5. The centre of sensitivity of our eyes coincides with the centre of the\nwavelength distribution of the sun. It is because humans have evolved\nwith visions most sensitive to the strongest wavelengths from\nthe sun.\n\nEXERCISES\n\n8.1 Figure 8.6 shows a capacitor made of two circular plates each of\nradius 12 cm, and separated by 5.0 cm.

Electromagnetic radiation belonging to this region of the\nspectrum (wavelength of about 400 nm to 750 nm) is called light. It is\nmainly through light and the sense of vision that we know and interpret\n\nthe world around us.\nThere are two things that we can intuitively mention about light from\n\ncommon experience. First, that it travels with enormous speed and second,\n\nthat it travels in a straight line. It took some time for people to realise that\n\nthe speed of light is finite and measurable. Its presently accepted value\nin vacuum is c = 2.99792458 × 108 m s–1.  For many purposes, it suffices\n\nto take c = 3 × 10\n8\n m s\n\n–1\n. The speed of light in vacuum is the highest\n\nspeed attainable in nature.\nThe intuitive notion that light travels in a straight line seems to\n\ncontradict what we have learnt in Chapter 8, that light is an\nelectromagnetic wave of wavelength belonging to the visible part of the\nspectrum. How to reconcile the two facts? The answer is that the\n\nwavelength of light is very small compared to the size of ordinary objects\nthat we encounter commonly (generally of the order of a few cm or larger).\nIn this situation, as you will learn in Chapter 10, a light wave can be\n\nconsidered to travel from one point to another, along a straight line joining\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n310\n\nthem. The path is called a ray of light, and a bundle of such rays\nconstitutes a beam of light.\n\nIn this chapter, we consider the phenomena of reflection, refraction\nand dispersion of light, using the ray picture of light. Using the basic\nlaws of reflection and refraction, we shall study the image formation by\nplane and spherical reflecting and refracting surfaces. We then go on to\ndescribe the construction and working of some important optical\ninstruments, including the human eye.\n\nPARTICLE MODEL OF LIGHT\n\nNewton’s fundamental contributions to mathematics, mechanics, and gravitation often blind\nus to his deep experimental and theoretical study of light. He made pioneering contributions\nin the field of optics. He further developed the corpuscular model of light proposed by\nDescartes. It presumes that light energy is concentrated in tiny particles called corpuscles.\nHe further assumed that corpuscles of light were massless elastic particles. With his\nunderstanding of mechanics, he could come up with a simple model of reflection and\nrefraction. It is a common observation that a ball bouncing from a smooth plane surface\nobeys the laws of reflection. When this is an elastic collision, the magnitude of the velocity\nremains the same. As the surface is smooth, there is no force acting parallel to the surface,\nso the component of momentum in this direction also remains the same. Only the component\nperpendicular to the surface, i.e., the normal component of the momentum, gets reversed\nin reflection. Newton argued that smooth surfaces like mirrors reflect the corpuscles in a\nsimilar manner.\n\nIn order to explain the phenomena of refraction, Newton postulated that the speed of\nthe corpuscles was greater in water or glass than in air. However, later on it was discovered\nthat the speed of light is less in water or glass than in air.\n\nIn the field of optics, Newton – the experimenter, was greater than Newton – the theorist.\nHe himself observed many phenomena, which were difficult to understand in terms of\nparticle nature of light. For example, the colours observed due to a thin film of oil on water.\nProperty of partial reflection of light is yet another such example. Everyone who has looked\ninto the water in a pond sees image of the face in it, but also sees the bottom of the pond.\nNewton argued that some of the corpuscles, which fall on the water, get reflected and some\nget transmitted. But what property could distinguish these two kinds of corpuscles? Newton\nhad to postulate some kind of unpredictable, chance phenomenon, which decided whether\nan individual corpuscle would be reflected or not. In explaining other phenomena, however,\nthe corpuscles were presumed to behave as if they are identical. Such a dilemma does not\noccur in the wave picture of light. An incoming wave can be divided into two weaker waves\nat the boundary between air and water.\n\n9.2  REFLECTION OF LIGHT BY SPHERICAL MIRRORS\nWe are familiar with the laws of reflection. The angle of reflection (i.e., the\n\nangle between reflected ray and the normal to the reflecting surface or\nthe mirror) equals the angle of incidence (angle between incident ray and\nthe normal). Also that the incident ray, reflected ray and the normal to\n\nthe reflecting surface at the point of incidence lie in the same plane\n(Fig. 9.1). These laws are valid at each point on any reflecting surface\nwhether plane or curved. However, we shall restrict our discussion to the\n\nspecial case of curved surfaces, that is, spherical surfaces. The normal in\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nRay Optics and\n\nOptical Instruments\n\n311\n\nthis case is to be taken as normal to the tangent\nto surface at the point of incidence. That is, the\nnormal is along the radius, the line joining the\n\ncentre of curvature of the mirror to the point of\nincidence.\n\nWe have already studied that the geometric\n\ncentre of a spherical mirror is called its pole while\nthat of a spherical lens is called its optical centre.\nThe line joining the pole and the centre of curvature\n\nof the spherical mirror is known as the principal\naxis. In the case of spherical lenses, the principal\naxis is the line joining the optical centre with its\n\nprincipal focus as you will see later.\n\n9.2.1  Sign convention\n\nTo derive the relevant formulae for reflection by spherical mirrors and\nrefraction by spherical lenses, we must first adopt a sign convention for\nmeasuring distances. In this book, we shall follow the Cartesian sign\n\nconvention. According to this\nconvention, all distances are measured\nfrom the pole of the mirror or the optical\n\ncentre of the lens. The distances\nmeasured in the same direction as the\nincident light are taken as positive and\n\nthose measured in the direction\nopposite to the direction of incident\nlight are taken as negative (Fig. 9.2).\n\nThe heights measured upwards with\nrespect to x-axis and normal to the\nprincipal axis (x-axis) of the mirror/\n\nlens are taken as positive (Fig. 9.2). The\nheights measured downwards are\ntaken as negative.\n\nWith a common accepted convention, it turns out that a single formula\nfor spherical mirrors and a single formula for spherical lenses can handle\nall different cases.\n\n9.2.2  Focal length of spherical mirrors\n\nFigure 9.3 shows what happens when a parallel beam of light is incident\n\non (a) a concave mirror, and (b) a convex mirror. We assume that the rays\n\nare paraxial, i.e., they are incident at points close to the pole P of the mirror\n\nand make small angles with the principal axis. The reflected rays converge\n\nat a point F on the principal axis of a concave mirror [Fig. 9.3(a)].\n\nFor a convex mirror, the reflected rays appear to diverge from a point F\n\non its principal axis [Fig. 9.3(b)]. The point F is called the principal focus\n\nof the mirror. If the parallel paraxial beam of light were incident, making\n\nsome angle with the principal axis, the reflected rays would converge (or\n\nappear to diverge) from a point in a plane through F normal to the principal\n\naxis. This is called the focal plane of the mirror [Fig. 9.3(c)].\n\nFIGURE 9.1 The incident ray, reflected ray\nand the normal to the reflecting surface lie\n\nin the same plane.\n\nFIGURE 9.2  The Cartesian Sign Convention.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n312\n\nThe distance between the focus F and the pole P of the mirror is called\nthe focal length of the mirror, denoted by f. We now show that f = R/2,\n\nwhere R is the radius of curvature of the mirror. The geometry\n\nof reflection of an incident ray is shown in Fig. 9.4.\nLet C be the centre of curvature of the mirror. Consider a\n\nray parallel to the principal axis striking the mirror at M. Then\n\nCM will be perpendicular to the mirror at M. Let θ be the angle\nof incidence, and MD be the perpendicular from M on the\nprincipal axis. Then,\n\n∠MCP = θ and ∠MFP = 2θ\nNow,\n\ntanθ =\nMD\n\nCD\n and tan 2θ = \n\nMD\n\nFD\n(9.1)\n\nFor small θ, which is true for paraxial rays, tanθ  ≈ θ,\ntan 2θ ≈ 2θ.  Therefore, Eq. (9.1) gives\n\nMD\n\nFD\n = 2 \n\nMD\n\nCD\n\nor, FD = \nCD\n\n2\n(9.2)\n\nNow, for small θ, the point D is very close to the point P.\nTherefore, FD = f and CD = R. Equation (9.2) then gives\n\nf = R/2 (9.3)\n\n9.2.3  The mirror equation\n\nIf rays emanating from a point actually meet at another point after\nreflection and/or refraction, that point is called the image of the first\n\npoint. The image is real if the rays actually converge to the point; it is\n\nFIGURE 9.3  Focus of a concave and convex mirror.\n\nFIGURE 9.4 Geometry of\n\nreflection of an incident ray on\n(a) concave spherical mirror,\n\nand (b) convex spherical mirror.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nRay Optics and\n\nOptical Instruments\n\n313\n\nvirtual if the rays do not actually meet but appear\nto diverge from the point when produced\nbackwards. An image is thus a point-to-point\n\ncorrespondence with the object established\nthrough reflection and/or refraction.\n\nIn principle, we can take any two rays\n\nemanating from a point on an object, trace their\npaths, find their point of intersection and thus,\nobtain the image of the point due to reflection at a\n\nspherical mirror. In practice, however, it is\nconvenient to choose any two of the following rays:\n(i) The ray from the point which is parallel to the\n\nprincipal axis. The reflected ray goes through\nthe focus of the mirror.\n\n(ii) The ray passing through the centre of\n\ncurvature of a concave mirror or appearing to pass through it for a\nconvex mirror. The reflected ray simply retraces the path.\n\n(iii) The ray passing through (or directed towards) the focus of the concave\n\nmirror or appearing to pass through (or directed towards) the focus\nof a convex mirror. The reflected ray is parallel to the principal axis.\n\n(iv) The ray incident at any angle at the pole. The reflected ray follows\n\nlaws of reflection.\nFigure 9.5 shows the ray diagram considering three rays. It shows\n\nthe image A′B′ (in this case, real) of an object AB formed by a concave\nmirror. It does not mean that only three rays emanate from the point A.\nAn infinite number of rays emanate from any source, in all directions.\nThus, point A′ is image point of A if every ray originating at point A and\nfalling on the concave mirror after reflection passes through the point A′.\n\nWe now derive the mirror equation or the relation between the object\ndistance (u), image distance (v) and the focal length ( f ).\n\nFrom Fig. 9.5, the two right-angled triangles A′B′F and MPF are\nsimilar. (For paraxial rays, MP can be considered to be a straight line\nperpendicular to CP.) Therefore,\n\nB A B F\n\nPM FP\n\n′ ′ ′\n=\n\nor \nB A B F\n\nBA FP\n\n′ ′ ′\n=  (∵PM = AB) (9.4)\n\nSince ∠ APB = ∠ A′PB′, the right angled triangles A′B′P and ABP are\nalso similar. Therefore,\n\nB A B P\n\nB A B P\n\n′ ′ ′\n= (9.5)\n\nComparing Eqs. (9.4) and (9.5), we get\n\nB P – FPB F B P\n\nFP FP BP\n\n′′ ′\n= = (9.6)\n\nEquation (9.6) is a relation involving magnitude of distances. We now\napply the sign convention. We note that light travels from the object to\n\nthe mirror MPN. Hence this is taken as the positive direction. To reach\n\nFIGURE 9.5 Ray diagram for image\nformation by a concave mirror.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n314\n\nthe object AB, image A′B′ as well as the focus F from the pole P, we have\nto travel opposite to the direction of incident light. Hence, all the three\nwill have negative signs. Thus,\n\nB′ P = –v, FP = –f, BP = –u\nUsing these in Eq. (9.6), we get\n\n– –\n\n–\n\nv f v\n\nf u\n\n+\n=\n\n–\n\nor\n–v f v\n\nf u\n=\n\n      \nv\n\nf\n\nv\n\nu\n= +1\n\nDividing it by v, we get\n\n      \n\n1 1 1\n\nv u f\n+ =\n\n(9.7)\n\nThis relation is known as the mirror equation.\nThe size of the image relative to the size of the object is another\n\nimportant quantity to consider. We define linear magnification (m) as the\nratio of the height of the image (h′) to the height of the object (h):\n\nm = \nh\n\nh\n\n′\n(9.8)\n\nh and h′ will be taken positive or negative in accordance with the accepted\nsign convention. In triangles A′B′P and ABP, we have,\n\nB A B P\n\nBA BP\n\n′ ′ ′\n=\n\nWith the sign convention, this becomes\n\n– –h v\n\nh u\n\n′\n=\n\n–\n\nso that\n\nm = –\nh v\n\nh u\n\n′\n= (9.9)\n\nWe have derived here the mirror equation, Eq. (9.7), and the\nmagnification formula, Eq. (9.9), for the case of real, inverted image formed\nby a concave mirror. With the proper use of sign convention, these are,\nin fact, valid for all the cases of reflection by a spherical mirror (concave\nor convex) whether the image formed is real or virtual. Figure 9.6 shows\nthe ray diagrams for virtual image formed by a concave and convex mirror.\nYou should verify that Eqs. (9.7) and (9.9) are valid for these cases as\nwell.\n\nFIGURE 9.6  Image formation by (a) a concave mirror with object between\nP and F, and (b) a convex mirror.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nRay Optics and\n\nOptical Instruments\n\n315\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 9\n\n.3\n E\n\nX\nA\n\nM\nP\nL\nE\n 9\n\n.2\n E\n\nX\nA\n\nM\nP\nL\nE\n 9\n\n.1\n\nExample 9.1 Suppose that the lower half of the concave mirror’s\nreflecting surface in Fig. 9.5 is covered with an opaque (non-reflective)\n\nmaterial. What effect will this have on the image of an object placed\nin front of the mirror?\n\nSolution You may think that the image will now show only half of the\n\nobject, but taking the laws of reflection to be true for all points of the\nremaining part of the mirror, the image will be that of the whole object.\nHowever, as the area of the reflecting surface has been reduced, the\n\nintensity of the image will be low (in this case, half).\n\nExample 9.2 A mobile phone lies along the principal axis of a concave\n\nmirror, as shown in Fig. 9.7. Show by suitable diagram, the formation\nof its image. Explain why the magnification is not uniform. Will the\ndistortion of image depend on the location of the phone with respect\n\nto the mirror?\n\nFIGURE 9.7\n\nSolution\n\nThe ray diagram for the formation of the image of the phone is shown\nin Fig. 9.7.

If\nthe jogger is running at a speed of 5 m s\n\n–1\n, how fast the image of the\n\njogger appear to move when the jogger is (a) 39 m, (b) 29 m, (c) 19 m,\n\nand (d) 9 m away.\n\nSolution\nFrom the mirror equation, Eq.

This phenomenon can be noticed by any person\n\nsitting in a stationary car or a bus. In case of moving vehicles, a\nsimilar phenomenon could be observed if the vehicle in the rear is\n\nmoving closer with a constant speed.\n\n9.3  REFRACTION\nWhen a beam of light encounters another transparent medium, a part of\nlight gets reflected back into the first medium while the rest enters the\nother. A ray of light represents a beam. The direction of propagation of an\n\nobliquely incident (0°< i < 90°) ray of light that enters the other medium,\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nRay Optics and\n\nOptical Instruments\n\n317\n\nchanges at the interface of the two media. This\n\nphenomenon is called refraction of light. Snell\n\nexperimentally obtained the following laws of\n\nrefraction:\n\n(i) The incident ray, the refracted ray and the\n\nnormal to the interface at the point of\n\nincidence, all lie in the same plane.\n\n(ii) The ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence\n\nto the sine of angle of refraction is constant.\n\nRemember that the angles of incidence (i ) and\n\nrefraction (r ) are the angles that the incident\n\nand  its refracted ray make with the normal,\n\nrespectively. We have\n\n21\n\nsin\n\nsin\n\ni\nn\n\nr\n= (9.10)\n\nwhere n\n21\n\n is a constant, called the refractive index of the second medium\n\nwith respect to the first medium. Equation (9.10) is the well-known Snell’s\nlaw of refraction. We note that n\n\n21\n is a characteristic of the pair of media\n\n(and also depends on the wavelength of light), but is independent of the\n\nangle of incidence.\nFrom Eq. (9.10), if n\n\n21\n > 1, r < i , i.e., the refracted ray bends towards\n\nthe normal. In such a case medium 2 is said to be optically denser (or\ndenser, in short) than medium 1. On the other hand, if n\n\n21\n <1, r > i, the\n\nrefracted ray bends away from the normal. This is the case when incident\n\nray in a denser medium refracts into a rarer medium.\n\nNote: Optical density should not be confused with mass density,\nwhich is mass per unit volume. It is possible that mass density of\n\nan optically denser medium may be less than that of an optically\n\nrarer medium (optical density is the ratio of the speed of light in\n\ntwo media). For example, turpentine and water. Mass density of\n\nturpentine is less than that of water but its optical density is higher.\n\nIf n\n21\n\n is the refractive index of medium 2\n\nwith respect to medium 1 and n\n12\n\n the refractive\n\nindex of medium 1 with respect to medium 2,\n\nthen it should be clear that\n\n12\n\n21\n\n1\nn\n\nn\n= (9.11)\n\nIt also follows that if n\n32\n\n is the refractive\n\nindex of medium 3 with respect to medium 2\nthen \n\n \nn\n\n32\n = n\n\n31\n ×  n\n\n12\n, where  n\n\n31\n is the refractive\n\nindex  of medium 3 with respect to medium 1.\n\nSome elementary results based on the laws\nof refraction follow immediately. For a\nrectangular slab, refraction takes place at two\n\ninterfaces (air-glass and glass-air). It is easily seen from Fig. 9.9 that\nr\n2\n = i\n\n1\n, i.e., the emergent ray is parallel to the incident ray—there is no\n\nFIGURE 9.8 Refraction and reflection of light.\n\nFIGURE 9.9  Lateral shift of a ray refracted\n\nthrough a parallel-sided slab.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n318  \nE\n\nX\nA\n\nM\nP\nL\nE\n 9\n\n.5\n\ndeviation, but it does suffer lateral displacement/\nshift with respect to the incident ray. Another familiar\nobservation is that the bottom of a tank filled with\n\nwater appears to be raised (Fig. 9.10). For viewing\nnear the normal direction, it can be shown that the\napparent depth (h\n\n1\n) is real depth (h\n\n2\n) divided by\n\nthe refractive index of the medium (water).\nThe refraction of light through the atmosphere\n\nis responsible for many interesting phenomena. For\n\nexample, the Sun is visible a little before the actual\nsunrise and until a little after the actual sunset\ndue to refraction of light through the atmosphere\n\n(Fig. 9.11). By actual sunrise we mean the actual\ncrossing of the horizon by the sun. Figure 9.11\nshows the actual and apparent positions of the Sun\n\nwith respect to the horizon. The figure is highly\nexaggerated to show the effect. The refractive index\nof air with respect to vacuum is 1.00029. Due to\n\nthis, the apparent shift in the direction of the Sun\nis by about half a degree and the corresponding\ntime difference between actual sunset and apparent\n\nsunset is about 2 minutes (see Example 9.5). The\napparent flattening (oval shape) of the Sun at sunset\nand sunrise is also due to the same phenomenon.\n\nFIGURE 9.10  Apparent depth for\n(a) normal, and (b) oblique viewing.\n\nFIGURE 9.11 Advance sunrise and delayed sunset due to\natmospheric refraction.\n\nExample 9.5 The earth takes 24 h to rotate once about its axis. How\nmuch time does the sun take to shift by 1° when viewed from\nthe earth?\n\nSolution\nTime taken for 360° shift = 24 h\n\nTime taken for 1° shift = 24/360 h = 4 min.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nRay Optics and\n\nOptical Instruments\n\n319\n\n9.4  TOTAL INTERNAL REFLECTION\nWhen light travels from an optically denser medium to a rarer medium\nat the interface, it is partly reflected back into the same medium and\npartly refracted to the second medium. This reflection is called the internal\n\nreflection.\n\nWhen a ray of light enters from a denser medium to a rarer medium,\nit bends away from the normal, for example, the ray AO\n\n1 \nB in Fig. 9.12.\n\nThe incident ray AO\n1\n is partially reflected (O\n\n1\nC) and partially transmitted\n\n(O\n1\nB) or refracted, the angle of refraction (r ) being larger than the angle of\n\nincidence (i ). As the angle of incidence increases, so does the angle of\n\nrefraction, till for the ray AO\n3\n, the angle of refraction is π/2. The refracted\n\nray is bent so much away from the normal that it grazes the surface at\nthe interface between the two media. This is shown by the ray AO\n\n3 \nD in\n\nFig. 9.12. If the angle of incidence is increased still further (e.g., the ray\nAO\n\n4\n), refraction is not possible, and the incident ray is totally reflected.\n\nTHE DROWNING CHILD, LIFEGUARD AND SNELL’S LAW\n\nConsider a rectangular swimming pool PQSR; see figure here. A lifeguard sitting at G\n\noutside the pool notices a child drowning at a point C. The guard wants to reach the\nchild in the shortest possible time. Let SR be the\nside of the pool between G and C. Should he/she\n\ntake a straight line path GAC between G and C or\nGBC in which the path BC in water would be the\nshortest, or some other path GXC? The guard knows\n\nthat his/her running speed v\n1\n on ground is higher\n\nthan his/her swimming speed v\n2\n.\n\nSuppose the guard enters water at X. Let GX =l\n1\n\nand XC =l\n2\n. Then the time taken to reach from G to\n\nC would be\n\n1 2\n\n1 2\n\nl l\nt\n\nv v\n= +\n\nTo make this time minimum, one has to\ndifferentiate it (with respect to the coordinate of X ) and find the point X when t is a\nminimum. On doing all this algebra (which we skip here), we find that the guard should\n\nenter water at a point where Snell’s law is satisfied. To understand this, draw a\nperpendicular LM to side SR at X. Let ∠GXM = i and ∠CXL = r. Then it can be seen that t\nis minimum when\n\n1\n\n2\n\nsin\n\nsin\n\nvi\n\nr v\n=\n\nIn the case of light v\n1\n/v\n\n2\n, the ratio of the velocity of light in vacuum to that in the\n\nmedium, is the refractive index n of the medium.\n\nIn short, whether it is a wave or a particle or a human being, whenever two mediums\nand two velocities are involved, one must follow Snell’s law if one wants to take the\nshortest time.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n320\n\nThis is called total internal reflection. When\nlight gets reflected by a surface, normally\nsome fraction of it gets transmitted. The\n\nreflected ray, therefore, is always less intense\nthan the incident ray, howsoever smooth the\nreflecting surface may be. In total internal\n\nreflection, on the other hand, no\ntransmission of light takes place.\n\nThe angle of incidence corresponding to\n\nan angle of refraction 90°, say ∠AO\n3\nN, is\n\ncalled the critical angle (i\nc\n ) for the given pair\n\nof media.   We see from Snell’s law [Eq. (9.10)]\n\nthat if the relative refractive index of the\nrefracting medium is less than one then,\nsince the maximum value of sin r is unity,\n\nthere is an upper limit to the value of sin i for which the law can be\nsatisfied, that is, i = i\n\nc\n such that\n\nsin i\nc\n  = n\n\n21\n(9.12)\n\nFor values of i larger than i\nc\n, Snell’s law of refraction cannot be\n\nsatisfied, and hence no refraction is possible.\nThe refractive index of denser medium 1 with respect to rarer medium\n\n2 will be n\n12\n\n = 1/sin i\nc\n. Some typical critical angles are listed in Table 9.1.\n\nFIGURE 9.12   Refraction and internal reflection\n\nof rays from a point A in the denser medium\n(water) incident at different angles at the interface\n\nwith a rarer medium (air).\n\nA demonstration for total internal reflection\n\nAll optical phenomena can be demonstrated very easily with the use of a\n\nlaser torch or pointer, which is easily available nowadays. Take a glass\nbeaker with clear water in it. Add a few drops of milk or any other\nsuspension to water and stir so that water becomes a little turbid. Take\n\na laser pointer and shine its beam through the turbid water. You will\nfind that the path of the beam inside the water shines brightly.\n\nShine the beam from below the beaker such that it strikes at the\n\nupper water surface at the other end. Do you find that it undergoes partial\nreflection (which is seen as a spot on the table below) and partial refraction\n[which comes out in the air and is seen as a spot on the roof; Fig. 9.13(a)]?\n\nNow direct the laser beam from one side of the beaker such that it strikes\nthe upper surface of water more obliquely [Fig. 9.13(b)]. Adjust the\ndirection of laser beam until you find the angle for which the refraction\n\nTABLE 9.1 CRITICAL ANGLE OF SOME TRANSPARENT MEDIA WITH RESPECT TO AIR\n\nSubstance medium Refractive index Critical angle\n\nWater 1.33 48.75\n\nCrown glass 1.52 41.14\n\nDense flint glass 1.62 37.31\n\nDiamond 2.42 24.41\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nRay Optics and\n\nOptical Instruments\n\n321\n\nabove the water surface is totally absent and the beam is totally reflected\nback to water. This is total internal reflection at its simplest.\n\nPour this water in a long test tube and shine the laser light from top,\n\nas shown in Fig. 9.13(c). Adjust the direction of the laser beam such that\nit is totally internally reflected every time it strikes the walls of the tube.\nThis is similar to what happens in optical fibres.\n\nTake care not to look into the laser beam directly and not to point it\nat anybody’s face.\n\n9.4.1 Total internal reflection in nature and\nits technological applications\n\n(i) Mirage: On hot summer days, the air near the ground becomes hotter\nthan the air at higher levels. The refractive index of air increases with\n\nits density. Hotter air is less dense, and has smaller refractive index\nthan the cooler air. If the air currents are small, that is, the air is still,\nthe optical density at different layers of air increases with height. As a\n\nresult, light from  a tall object such as a tree, passes through a medium\nwhose refractive index decreases towards the ground. Thus, a ray of\nlight from such an object successively bends away from the normal\n\nand undergoes total internal reflection, if the angle of incidence for\nthe air near the ground exceeds the critical angle. This is shown in\nFig. 9.14(b). To a distant observer, the light appears to be coming\nfrom somewhere below the ground. The observer naturally assumes\n\nthat light is being reflected from the ground, say, by a pool of water\nnear the tall object. Such inverted images of distant tall objects cause\nan optical illusion to the observer. This phenomenon is called mirage.\n\nThis type of mirage is especially common in hot deserts. Some of you\nmight have noticed that while moving in a bus or a car during a hot\nsummer day, a distant patch of road, especially on a highway, appears\n\nto be wet. But, you do not find any evidence of wetness when you\nreach that spot. This is also due to mirage.\n\nFIGURE 9.13\nObserving total\n\ninternal reflection in\n\nwater with a laser\nbeam (refraction due\n\nto glass of beaker\n\nneglected being very\nthin).\n\nFIGURE 9.14 (a) A tree is seen by an observer at its place when the air above the ground is\nat uniform temperature,  (b) When the layers of air close to the ground have varying\n\ntemperature with hottest layers near the ground, light from a distant tree may\n\nundergo total internal reflection, and the apparent image of the tree may create\nan illusion to the observer that the tree is near a pool of water.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n322\n\n(ii) Diamond: Diamonds are known for their\nspectacular brilliance.  Their brilliance\nis mainly due to the total internal\n\nreflection of light inside them. The critical\nangle for diamond-air interface (≅ 24.4°)\nis very small, therefore once light enters\n\na diamond, it is very likely to undergo\ntotal internal reflection inside it.\nDiamonds found in nature rarely exhibit\n\nthe brilliance for which they are known.\nIt is the technical skill of a diamond\ncutter which makes diamonds to\n\nsparkle so brilliantly.  By cutting the\ndiamond suitably, multiple total\ninternal reflections can be made\n\nto occur.\n(iii)Prism : Prisms designed to bend light by\n\n90° or by 180° make use of total internal\n\nreflection [Fig. 9.15(a) and (b)]. Such a\nprism is also used to invert images\nwithout changing their size [Fig. 9.15(c)].\n\nIn the first two cases, the critical angle i\nc\n for the material of the prism\n\nmust be less than 45°. We see from Table 9.1 that this is true for both\ncrown glass and dense flint glass.\n(iv) Optical fibres: Nowadays optical fibres are extensively used for\n\ntransmitting audio and video signals through long distances. Optical\nfibres too make use of the phenomenon of total internal reflection.\nOptical fibres are fabricated with high quality composite glass/quartz\n\nfibres. Each fibre consists of a core and cladding. The refractive index\nof the material of the core is higher than that of the cladding.\n\nWhen a signal in the form of light is\n\ndirected at one end of the fibre at a suitable\n\nangle, it undergoes repeated total internal\n\nreflections along the length of the fibre and\n\nfinally comes out at the other end (Fig. 9.16).\n\nSince light undergoes total internal reflection\n\nat each stage, there is no appreciable loss in\n\nthe intensity of the light signal. Optical fibres\n\nare fabricated such that light reflected at one\n\nside of inner surface strikes the other at an\n\nangle larger than the critical angle. Even if the\n\nfibre is bent, light can easily travel along its\n\nlength. Thus, an optical fibre can be used to act as an optical pipe.\n\nA bundle of optical fibres can be put to several uses. Optical fibres\n\nare extensively used for transmitting and receiving electrical signals which\n\nare converted to light by suitable transducers. Obviously, optical fibres\n\ncan also be used for transmission of optical signals. For example, these\n\nare used as a ‘light pipe’ to facilitate visual examination of internal organs\n\nlike esophagus, stomach and intestines. You might have seen a commonly\n\nFIGURE 9.15 Prisms designed to bend rays by\n\n90° and 180° or to invert image without changing\nits size make use of total internal reflection.\n\nFIGURE 9.16 Light undergoes successive total\ninternal reflections as it moves through an\n\noptical fibre.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nRay Optics and\n\nOptical Instruments\n\n323\n\navailable decorative lamp with fine plastic fibres with their free ends\nforming a fountain like structure. The other end of the fibres is fixed over\nan electric lamp. When the lamp is switched on, the light travels from the\n\nbottom of each fibre and appears at the tip of its free end as a dot of light.\nThe fibres in such decorative lamps are optical fibres.\n\nThe main requirement in fabricating optical fibres is that there should\n\nbe very little absorption of light as it travels for long distances inside\nthem. This has been achieved by purification and special preparation of\nmaterials such as quartz. In silica glass fibres, it is possible to transmit\n\nmore than 95% of the light over a fibre length of 1 km. (Compare with\nwhat you expect for a block of ordinary window glass 1 km thick.)\n\n9.5 REFRACTION AT SPHERICAL SURFACES\nAND BY LENSES\n\nWe have so far considered refraction at a plane interface. We shall now\n\nconsider refraction at a spherical interface between two transparent media.\n\nAn infinitesimal part of a spherical surface can be regarded as planar\n\nand the same laws of refraction can be applied at every point on the\n\nsurface. Just as for reflection by a spherical mirror, the normal at the\n\npoint of incidence is perpendicular to the tangent plane to the spherical\n\nsurface at that point and, therefore, passes through its centre of curvature.\n\nWe first consider refraction by a single spherical surface and follow it by\n\nthin lenses. A thin lens is a transparent optical medium bounded by two\n\nsurfaces; at least one of which should be spherical. Applying the formula\n\nfor image formation by a single spherical surface successively at the two\n\nsurfaces of a lens, we shall obtain the lens maker’s formula and then the\n\nlens formula.\n\n9.5.1  Refraction at a spherical surface\n\nFigure 9.17 shows the geometry of formation of image I of an object O on\nthe principal axis of a spherical surface with centre of curvature C, and\n\nradius of curvature R. The rays are incident from a medium of refractive\nindex n\n\n1\n, to another of refractive index n\n\n2\n. As before, we take the aperture\n\n(or the lateral size) of the surface to be small\n\ncompared to other distances involved, so that small\nangle approximation can be made. In particular,\nNM will be taken to be nearly equal to the length of\n\nthe perpendicular from the point N on the principal\naxis. We have, for small angles,\n\ntan ∠NOM = \nMN\n\nOM\n\ntan ∠NCM = \nMN\n\nMC\n\ntan ∠NIM  = \nMN\n\nMI\n\nFIGURE 9.17  Refraction at a spherical\n\nsurface separating two media.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n324\n\nNow, for ∆NOC, i is the exterior angle. Therefore, i = ∠NOM + ∠NCM\n\ni = \nMN MN\n\nOM MC\n+ (9.13)\n\nSimilarly,\n\nr = ∠NCM – ∠NIM\n\ni.e., r = \nMN MN\n\nMC MI\n− (9.14)\n\nNow, by Snell’s law\n\nn\n1\n sin i = n\n\n2\n sin r\n\nor for small angles\n\nn\n1\ni = n\n\n2\nr\n\nLIGHT SOURCES AND PHOTOMETRY\n\nIt is known that a body above absolute zero temperature emits electromagnetic radiation.\nThe wavelength region in which the body emits the radiation depends on its absolute\n\ntemperature. Radiation emitted by a hot body, for example, a tungsten filament lamp\nhaving temperature 2850 K are partly invisible and mostly in infrared (or heat) region.\nAs the temperature of the body increases radiation emitted by it is in visible region. The\n\nsun with temperature of about 5500 K emits radiation whose energy versus wavelength\ngraph peaks approximately at 550 nm corresponding to green light and is almost in the\nmiddle of the visible region. The energy versus wavelength distribution graph for a given\n\nbody peaks at some wavelength, which is inversely proportional to the absolute\ntemperature of that body.\n\nThe measurement of light as perceived by human eye is called photometry. Photometry\n\nis measurement of a physiological phenomenon, being the stimulus of light as received\nby the human eye, transmitted by the optic nerves and analysed by the brain. The main\nphysical quantities in photometry are (i) the luminous intensity of the source,\n\n(ii) the luminous flux or flow of light from the source, and (iii) illuminance of the surface.\nThe SI unit of luminous intensity (I ) is candela (cd). The candela is the luminous intensity,\nin a given direction, of a source that emits monochromatic radiation of frequency\n\n540 × 10\n12\n\n Hz and that has a radiant intensity in that direction of 1/683 watt per steradian.\nIf a light source emits one candela of luminous intensity into a solid angle of one steradian,\nthe total luminous flux emitted into that solid angle is one lumen (lm). A standard\n\n100 watt incadescent light bulb emits approximately 1700 lumens.\nIn photometry, the only parameter, which can be measured directly is illuminance. It\n\nis defined as luminous flux incident per unit area on a surface (lm/m2 or lux ). Most light\n\nmeters measure this quantity. The illuminance E, produced by a source of luminous\nintensity I, is given by E = I/r\n\n2\n, where r is the normal distance of the surface from the\n\nsource. A quantity named luminance (L), is used to characterise the brightness of emitting\n\nor reflecting flat surfaces. Its unit is cd/m\n2 \n(sometimes called ‘nit’ in industry). A good\n\nLCD computer monitor has a brightness of about 250 nits.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nRay Optics and\n\nOptical Instruments\n\n325\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 9\n\n.6\n\nSubstituting i and r from Eqs.

(9.15), we get\n\n2 1 2 1n n n n\n\nv u R\n\n−\n− = (9.16)\n\nEquation (9.16) gives us a relation between object and image distance\n\nin terms of refractive index of the medium and the radius of\ncurvature of the curved spherical surface. It holds for any curved\nspherical surface.\n\nExample 9.6 Light from a point source in air falls on a spherical\nglass surface (n = 1.5 and radius of curvature = 20 cm). The distance\nof the light source from the glass surface is 100 cm. At what position\n\nthe image is formed?\n\nSolution\nWe use the relation given by Eq. (9.16). Here\n\nu = – 100 cm, v = ?, R = + 20 cm, n\n1\n = 1, and n\n\n2\n = 1.5.\n\nWe then have\n\n1.5 1 0.5\n\n100 20v\n+ =\n\nor   v = +100 cm\n\nThe image is formed at a distance of 100 cm from the glass surface,\n\nin the direction of incident light.\n\n9.5.2  Refraction by a lens\n\nFigure 9.18(a) shows the geometry of image formation by a double convex\nlens. The image formation can be seen in terms of two steps:\n\n(i) The first refracting surface forms the image I\n1\n of the object O\n\n[Fig. 9.18(b)]. The image I\n1\n acts as a virtual object for the second surface\n\nthat forms the image at I [Fig. 9.18(c)]. Applying Eq.

A lens has two foci, F and\n\nF′, on either side of it (Fig. 9.19). By the\nsign convention,\n\nBC\n1\n = + R\n\n1\n,\n\nDC\n2\n = –R\n\n2\n\nSo Eq. (9.20) can be written as\n\n( ) 221 21\n1 2 1\n\n1 1 1\n1\n\nn\nn n\n\nf R R n\n\n\uf8eb \uf8f6 \uf8eb \uf8f6\n= − − =\uf8ec \uf8f7 \uf8ec \uf8f7\uf8ed \uf8f8 \uf8ed \uf8f8\n\n∵ (9.21)\n\nEquation (9.21) is known as the lens\nmaker’s formula. It is useful to design\n\nlenses of desired focal length using surfaces\nof suitable radii of curvature. Note that the\nformula is true for a concave lens also. In\n\nthat case R\n1\nis negative, R\n\n2\n positive and\n\ntherefore, f is negative.\nFrom Eqs. (9.19) and (9.20), we get\n\n1 1 1\n\nOB DI\n\nn n n\n\nf\n+ = (9.22)\n\nAgain, in the thin lens approximation, B and D are both close to the\noptical centre of the lens. Applying the sign convention,\n\nBO = – u, DI = +v, we get\n\n1 1 1\n\nv u f\n− = (9.23)\n\nEquation (9.23) is the familiar thin lens formula. Though we derived\nit for a real image formed by a convex lens, the formula is valid for both\nconvex as well as concave lenses and for both real and virtual images.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the two foci, F and F′, of a double convex\nor concave lens are equidistant from the optical centre. The focus on the\nside of the (original) source of light is called the first focal point, whereas\n\nthe other is called the second focal point.\nTo find the image of an object by a lens, we can, in principle, take any\n\ntwo rays emanating from a point on an object; trace their paths using\n\nFIGURE 9.18  (a) The position of object, and the\nimage formed by a double convex lens,\n\n(b) Refraction at the first spherical surface and\n\n(c) Refraction at the second spherical surface.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nRay Optics and\n\nOptical Instruments\n\n327\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 9\n\n.7\n\nthe laws of refraction and find the point where\nthe refracted rays meet (or appear to meet). In\npractice, however, it is convenient to choose any\n\ntwo of the following rays:\n(i) A ray emanating from the object parallel to\n\nthe principal axis of the lens after refraction\n\npasses through the second principal focus\nF′ (in a convex lens) or appears to diverge (in\na concave lens) from the first principal focus F.\n\n(ii) A ray of light, passing through the optical\ncentre of the lens, emerges without any\ndeviation after refraction.\n\n(iii) (a) A ray of light passing through the first\nprincipal focus of a convex lens [Fig. 9.19(a)]\nemerges parallel to the principal axis after\n\nrefraction.\n(b) A ray of light incident on a concave lens\nappearing to meet the principal axis at\n\nsecond focus point emerges parallel to the\nprincipal axis after refraction [Fig. 9.19(b)].\nFigures 9.19(a) and (b) illustrate these rules\n\nfor a convex and a concave  lens, respectively.\nYou should practice drawing similar ray diagrams for different positions\nof the object with respect to the lens and also verify that the lens formula,\n\nEq. (9.23), holds good for all cases.\nHere again it must be remembered that each point on an object gives\n\nout infinite number of rays. All these rays will pass through the same\n\nimage point after refraction at the lens.\nMagnification (m ) produced by a lens is defined, like that for a mirror,\n\nas the ratio of the size of the image to that of the object. Proceeding in the\n\nsame way as for spherical mirrors, it is easily seen that for a lens\n\nm = \nh\n\nh\n\n′\n =  \n\nv\n\nu\n(9.24)\n\nWhen we apply the sign convention, we see that, for erect (and virtual)\n\nimage formed by a convex or concave lens, m is positive, while for an\ninverted (and real) image, m is negative.\n\nExample 9.7 A magician during a show makes a glass lens with\nn = 1.47 disappear in a trough of liquid.  What is the refractive index\n\nof the liquid? Could the liquid be water?\n\nSolution\nThe refractive index of the liquid must be equal to 1.47 in order to\n\nmake the lens disappear. This means n\n1\n = n\n\n2\n. This gives 1/f  =0 or\n\nf → ∞. The lens in the liquid will act like a plane sheet of glass. No,\nthe liquid is not water. It could be glycerine.\n\n9.5.3  Power of a lens\nPower of a lens is a measure of the convergence or divergence, which a\n\nlens introduces in the light falling on it.

The power P of a lens is defined as the\n\ntangent of the angle by which it converges or diverges a\nbeam of light parallel to the principal axis falling at unit\ndistance from the optical centre (Fig. 9.20).\n\ntan ; , tanδ δ= = =\nh\n\nf\nh\n\nf\nif 1\n\n1\n or \n\n1\n\nf\nδ =  for small\n\nvalue of δ. Thus,\n\nP = \n1\n\nf\n(9.25)\n\nThe SI unit for power of a lens is dioptre (D): 1D = 1m\n–1\n\n. The power of\na lens of focal length of 1 metre is one dioptre. Power of a lens is positive\n\nfor a converging lens and negative for a diverging lens. Thus, when an\noptician prescribes a corrective lens of power + 2.5 D, the required lens is\na convex lens of focal length + 40 cm. A lens of power of – 4.0 D means a\n\nconcave lens of focal length – 25 cm.\n\nExample 9.8 (i) If f = 0.5 m for a glass lens, what is the power of the\nlens?

Let the object be placed at a point O beyond the focus of\n\nFIGURE 9.20 Power of a lens.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nRay Optics and\n\nOptical Instruments\n\n329\n\nthe first lens A (Fig. 9.21). The first lens produces\nan image at I\n\n1\n. Since image I\n\n1\n is real, it serves as a\n\nvirtual object for the second lens B, producing the\n\nfinal image at I. It must, however, be borne in mind\nthat formation of image by the first lens is presumed\nonly to facilitate determination of the position of the\n\nfinal image. In fact, the direction of rays emerging\nfrom the first lens gets modified in accordance with\nthe angle at which they strike the second lens. Since\n\nthe lenses are thin, we assume the optical centres of the lenses to be\ncoincident. Let this central point be denoted by P.\n\nFor the image formed by the first lens A, we get\n\n1 1\n\n1 1 1\n\nv u f\n− = (9.27)\n\nFor the image formed by the second lens B, we get\n\n1 2\n\n1 1 1\n\nv v f\n− = (9.28)\n\nAdding Eqs. (9.27) and (9.28), we get\n\n1 2\n\n1 1 1 1\n\nv u f f\n− = + (9.29)\n\nIf the two lens-system is regarded as equivalent to a single lens of\nfocal length f, we have\n\n1 1 1\n\nv u f\n− =\n\nso that we get\n\n1 2\n\n1 1 1\n\nf f f\n= + (9.30)\n\nThe derivation is valid for any number of thin lenses in contact. If\nseveral thin lenses of focal length f\n\n1\n, f\n\n2\n, f\n\n3\n,... are in contact, the effective\n\nfocal length of their combination is given by\n\n1 2 3\n\n1 1 1 1\n\nf f f f\n= + + + … (9.31)\n\nIn terms of power, Eq. (9.31) can be written as\n\nP = P\n1\n + P\n\n2\n + P\n\n3\n + … (9.32)\n\nwhere P is the net power of the lens combination. Note that the sum in\nEq. (9.32) is an algebraic sum of individual powers, so some of the terms\n\non the right side may be positive (for convex lenses) and some negative\n(for concave lenses). Combination of lenses helps to obtain diverging or\nconverging lenses of desired magnification. It also enhances sharpness\n\nof the image. Since the image formed by the first lens becomes the object\nfor the second, Eq. (9.25) implies that the total magnification m of the\ncombination is a product of magnification (m\n\n1\n, m\n\n2\n, m\n\n3\n,...) of individual\n\nlenses\n\nm = m\n1 \nm\n\n2\n m\n\n3\n  ...

The angle between the\n\nemergent ray RS and the direction of the incident ray PQ is called the\nangle of deviation, δ.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nRay Optics and\n\nOptical Instruments\n\n331\n\nIn the quadrilateral AQNR, two of the angles\n(at the vertices Q and R) are right angles.\nTherefore, the sum of the other angles of the\n\nquadrilateral is 180°.\n\n∠A + ∠QNR = 180°\nFrom the triangle QNR,\n\nr\n1\n + r2 + ∠QNR = 180°\n\nComparing these two equations, we get\n\nr\n1\n + r2 = A (9.34)\n\nThe total deviation δ  is the sum of deviations\nat the two faces,\n\nδ = (i – r\n1\n ) + (e – r2 )\n\nthat is,\n\nδ  = i + e – A (9.35)\nThus, the angle of deviation depends on the angle of incidence. A plot\n\nbetween the angle of deviation and angle of incidence is shown in\nFig. 9.24. You can see that, in general, any given value of δ,  except for\ni = e, corresponds to two values i and hence of e. This, in fact, is expected\nfrom the symmetry of i and e in Eq. (9.35), i.e., δ  remains the same if i\nand e are interchanged. Physically, this is related\nto the fact that the path of ray in Fig. 9.23 can be\ntraced back, resulting in the same angle of\n\ndeviation. At the minimum deviation D\nm\n, the\n\nrefracted ray inside the prism becomes parallel\nto its base.  We have\n\nδ = D\nm\n, i = e which implies r\n\n1\n = r\n\n2\n.\n\nEquation (9.34) gives\n\n2r = A or r = \n2\n\nA\n(9.36)\n\nIn the same way, Eq. (9.35) gives\n\nD\nm\n = 2i – A, or i = (A + D\n\nm\n)/2        (9.37)\n\nThe refractive index of the prism is\n\n2\n21\n\n1\n\nsin[( )/2]\n\nsin[ /2]\nmA Dnn\n\nn A\n\n+\n= = (9.38)\n\nThe angles A and D\nm\n can be measured\n\nexperimentally.

The spectacles of colours that we see around us all the time\n\nis possible due to sunlight.\n\nWhile studying dispersion of visible (or white) light by a prism\n\n(Class X) and the electromagnetic spectrum (Chapter 8, Class XII), we\n\ngot to know that colour is associated with the frequency of light or the\n\nwavelength of light in the given medium. In the visible spectrum, red\n\nlight is at the long wavelength end (~700 nm) while the violet light is at\n\nthe short wavelength end (~ 400 nm). Dispersion takes place because\n\nthe refractive index of medium for different frequencies (colours) is\n\ndifferent. For example, the bending of red component of white light is\n\nleast while it is most for the violet. Equivalently, red light travels faster\n\nthan violet light in a glass prism. Table 9.2 gives the refractive indices for\n\ndifferent wavelength for crown glass and flint glass. Thick lenses could\n\nbe assumed as made of many prisms, therefore, thick lenses show\n\nchromatic aberration due to dispersion of light. When white light passes\n\nthrough thick lenses, red and blue colours focus at different points. This\n\nphenomenon is known as chromatic aberration.\n\nColour Wavelength (nm) Crown glass Flint glass\n\nViolet 396.9 1.533 1.663\n\nBlue 486.1 1.523 1.639\n\nYellow 589.3 1.517 1.627\n\nRed 656.3 1.515 1.622\n\nTABLE 9.2 REFRACTIVE INDICES FOR DIFFERENT WAVELENGTHS\n\nThe variation of refractive index with wavelength may be more\n\npronounced in some media than the other. In vacuum, of course, the\n\nspeed of light is independent of wavelength. Thus, vacuum (or air\n\napproximately) is a non-dispersive medium in which all colours travel\n\nwith the same speed. This also follows from the fact that sunlight reaches\n\nus in the form of white light and not as its components. On the other\n\nhand, glass is a dispersive medium.\n\nThe blue of the sky, white clouds, the red-hue at sunrise and sunset,\n\nthe rainbow, the brilliant colours of some pearls, shells, and wings of\n\nbirds, are just a few of the natural wonders we are used to. We describe\n\nsome of them here from the point of view of physics.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nRay Optics and\n\nOptical Instruments\n\n333\n\n9.7.1  The rainbow\n\nThe rainbow is an example of the dispersion of sunlight by the water\ndrops in the atmosphere. This is a phenomenon due to combined effect\nof dispersion, refraction and reflection of sunlight by spherical water\n\ndroplets of rain. The conditions for observing a rainbow are that the Sun\nshould be shining in one part of the sky (say near western horizon) while\nit is raining in the opposite part of the sky (say eastern horizon).\n\nAn observer can therefore see a rainbow only when his back is towards\nthe Sun.\n\nIn order to understand the formation of rainbows, consider\n\nFig. 9.25(a). Sunlight is first refracted as it enters a raindrop, which causes\nthe different wavelengths (colours) of white light to separate. Longer\nwangelength of light (red) are bent the least while the shorter wavelength\n\n(violet) are bent the most. Next, these component rays strike the inner\nsurface of the water drop and get internally reflected if the angle between\nthe refracted ray and normal to the drop surface is greater then the critical\n\nangle (48° in this case). The reflected light is refracted again when it comes\nout of the drop, as shown in the figure. It is found that the violet light\nemerges at an angle of 40° related to the incoming sunlight and red light\n\nemerges at an angle of 42°. For other colours, angles lie in between these\ntwo values.\n\nFigure 9.25(b) explains the formation of primary rainbow. We see\n\nthat red light from drop 1 and violet light from drop 2 reach the observer’s\neye. The violet from drop 1 and red light from drop 2 are directed at level\nabove or below the observer. Thus the observer sees a rainbow with\n\nred colour on the top and violet on the bottom. The primary\nrainbow is a result of three-step process, that is, refraction, reflection\nand refraction.\n\nF\no\nr\nm\n\na\nt\nio\n\nn\n o\n\nf r\na\nin\n\nb\no\nw\n\ns\n\nh\nttp\n\n://w\nw\n\nw\n.e\n\no\n.u\n\nc\na\nr.e\n\nd\nu\n/ra\n\nin\nb\no\nw\n\ns\nh\nttp\n\n://w\nw\n\nw\n.a\n\nto\np\ntic\n\ns.c\no\n.u\n\nk\n/b\n\no\nw\n\ns.h\ntm\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n334\n\nWhen light rays undergoes two internal reflections inside a raindrop,\ninstead of one as in the primary rainbow, a secondary rainbow is formed\n\nas shown in Fig. 9.25(c). It is due to four-step process. The intensity of\nlight is reduced at the second reflection and hence the secondary rainbow\nis fainter than the primary rainbow. Further, the order of the colours is\n\nreversed in it as is clear from Fig. 9.25(c).\n\n9.7.2  Scattering of light\n\nAs sunlight travels through the earth’s atmosphere, it gets scattered\n(changes its direction) by the atmospheric particles. Light of shorter\nwavelengths is scattered much more than light of longer wavelengths.\n\n(The amount of scattering is inversely proportional to the fourth power\nof the wavelength. This is known as Rayleigh scattering). Hence, the bluish\ncolour predominates in a clear sky, since blue has a shorter wave-\n\nlength than red and is scattered much more strongly. In fact, violet\ngets scattered even more than blue, having a shorter wavelength.\nBut since our eyes are more sensitive to blue than violet, we see the\n\nsky blue.\nLarge particles like dust and water droplets present in the atmosphere\n\nbehave differently. The relevant quantity here is the relative size of the\n\nwavelength of light λ, and the scatterer (of typical size, say, a). For a << λ,\none has Rayleigh scattering which is proportional to 1/λ4. For a >> λ,\ni.e., large scattering objects (for example, raindrops, large dust or ice\n\nparticles) this is not true; all wavelengths are scattered nearly equally.\nThus, clouds which have droplets of water with a >> λ are generally white.\n\nFIGURE 9.25  Rainbow: (a) The sun rays incident on a water drop get\nrefracted twice and reflected internally by a drop; (b) Enlarged view of\ninternal reflection and refraction of a ray of light inside a drop forming\n\nprimary rainbow; and (c) secondary rainbow is formed by rays undergoing\ninternal reflection twice inside the drop.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nRay Optics and\n\nOptical Instruments\n\n335\n\nAt sunset or sunrise, the sun’s rays have to pass through a larger\ndistance in the atmosphere (Fig. 9.26). Most of the blue and other shorter\nwavelengths are removed by scattering. The least scattered light reaching\nour eyes, therefore, the sun looks reddish. This explains the reddish\nappearance of the sun and full moon near the horizon.\n\n9.8  OPTICAL INSTRUMENTS\nA number of optical devices and instruments have been designed utilising\n\nreflecting and refracting properties of mirrors, lenses and prisms.\nPeriscope, kaleidoscope, binoculars, telescopes, microscopes are some\nexamples of optical devices and instruments that are in common use.\n\nOur eye is, of course, one of the most important optical device the nature\nhas endowed us with. We have already studied about the human eye in\nClass X. We now go on to describe the principles of working of the\n\nmicroscope and the telescope.\n\n9.8.1  The microscope\n\nA simple magnifier or microscope is a converging lens of small focal length\n\n(Fig. 9.27). In order to use such a lens as a microscope, the lens is held\n\nFIGURE 9.26  Sunlight travels through a longer distance in the\n\natmosphere at sunset and sunrise.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n336\n\nnear the object, one focal length away or less, and the eye is positioned\n\nclose to the lens on the other side. The idea is to get an erect, magnified\n\nand virtual image of the object at a distance so that it can be viewed\n\ncomfortably, i.e., at 25 cm or more. If the object is at a distance f, the\n\nimage is at infinity. However, if the object is at a distance slightly less\n\nthan the focal length of the lens, the image is virtual and closer than\n\ninfinity. Although the closest comfortable distance for viewing the image\n\nis when it is at the near point (distance D ≅ 25 cm), it causes some strain\non the eye. Therefore, the image formed at infinity is often considered\n\nmost suitable for viewing by the relaxed eye. We show both cases, the\n\nfirst in Fig. 9.27(a), and the second in Fig. 9.27(b) and (c).\n\nThe linear magnification m, for the image formed at the near point D,\n\nby a simple microscope can be obtained by using the relation\n\nm\nv\n\nu\nv\n\nv f\n\nv\n\nf\n= =\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f7 =\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f7\n\n1 1\n1– –\n\nNow according to our sign convention, v is negative, and is equal in\n\nmagnitude to D. Thus, the magnification is\n\nm\nD\n\nf\n= +\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n1 (9.39)\n\nFIGURE 9.27  A simple microscope; (a) the magnifying lens is located\nsuch that the image is at the near point,  (b) the angle subtanded by the\nobject, is the same as that at the near point, and  (c) the object near the\n\nfocal point of the lens; the image is far off but closer than infinity.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nRay Optics and\n\nOptical Instruments\n\n337\n\nSince D is about 25 cm, to have a magnification of six, one needs a convex\n\nlens of focal length, f = 5 cm.\n\nNote that m = h′/h where h is the size of the object and h′ the size of\nthe image. This is also the ratio of the angle subtended by the image\n\nto that subtended by the object, if placed at D for comfortable viewing.\n\n(Note that this is not the angle actually subtended by the object at the\n\neye, which is h/u.) What a single-lens simple magnifier achieves is that it\n\nallows the object to be brought closer to the eye than D.\n\nWe will now find the magnification when the image is at infinity. In\n\nthis case we will have to obtained the angular magnification. Suppose\n\nthe object has a height h. The maximum angle it can subtend, and be\n\nclearly visible (without a lens), is when it is at the near point, i.e., a distance\n\nD. The angle subtended is then given by\n\ntan θo\nh\n\nD\n= \uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n≈ θ\no\n\n(9.40)\n\nWe now find the angle subtended at the eye by the image when the\n\nobject is at u. From the relations\n\n \nh v\n\nm\nh u\n\n′\n= =\n\nwe have the angle subtended by the image\n\n tan \ni\n\nh h v h\n\nv v u u\nθ\n\n′\n= = ⋅ =\n\n− − −\n≈θ\n\n \n.

(9.39), but the viewing is more comfortable and the difference\n\nin magnification is usually small. In subsequent discussions of optical\n\ninstruments (microscope and telescope) we shall assume the image to be\n\nat infinity.\n\nA simple microscope has a limited maximum magnification (≤ 9) for\nrealistic focal lengths. For much larger magnifications, one uses two lenses,\n\none compounding the effect of the other. This is known as a compound\n\nmicroscope. A schematic diagram of a compound microscope is shown\n\nin Fig. 9.28. The lens nearest the object, called the objective, forms a\n\nreal, inverted, magnified image of the object. This serves as the object for\n\nthe second lens, the eyepiece, which functions essentially like a simple\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n338\n\nmicroscope or magnifier, produces the final image, which is enlarged\n\nand virtual. The first inverted image is thus near (at or within) the focal\n\nplane of the eyepiece, at a distance appropriate for final image formation\n\nat infinity, or a little closer for image formation at the near point. Clearly,\n\nthe final image is inverted with respect to the original object.\n\nWe now obtain the magnification due to a compound microscope.\n\nThe ray diagram of Fig. 9.28 shows that the (linear) magnification due to\n\nthe objective, namely h′/h, equals\n\nO\n\no\n\nh L\nm\n\nh f\n\n′\n= = (9.43)\n\nwhere we have used the result\n\ntan β =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n=\n′\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\nh\n\nf\n\nh\n\nLo\n\nHere h′ is the size of the first image, the object size being h and f\no\n\nbeing the focal length of the objective. The first image is formed near the\n\nfocal point of the eyepiece. The distance L, i.e., the distance between the\n\nsecond focal point of the objective and the first focal point of the eyepiece\n\n(focal length f\ne\n) is called the tube length of the compound microscope.\n\nAs the first inverted image is near the focal point of the eyepiece, we\n\nuse the result from the discussion above for the simple microscope to\n\nobtain the (angular) magnification m\ne\n due to it  [Eq.

In practice, it is difficult to make the focal length much smaller\n\nthan 1 cm. Also large lenses are required to make L large.\n\nFor example, with an objective with f\no\n = 1.0 cm, and an eyepiece with\n\nfocal length f\ne\n = 2.0 cm, and a tube length of 20 cm, the magnification is\n\nm m m\nL\n\nf\n\nD\n\nf\no e\n\no e\n\n= =\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f7\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f7\n\n     \n20 25\n\n250\n1 2\n\n\uf03d \uf0b4 \uf03d\n\nVarious other factors such as illumination of the object, contribute to\n\nthe quality and visibility of the image. In modern microscopes, multi-\n\ncomponent lenses are used for both the objective and the eyepiece to\n\nimprove image quality by minimising various optical aberrations (defects)\n\nin lenses.\n\n9.8.2  Telescope\n\nThe telescope is used to provide angular magnification of distant objects\n\n(Fig. 9.29). It also has an objective and an eyepiece. But here, the objective\n\nhas a large focal length and a much larger aperture than the eyepiece.\n\nLight from a distant object enters the objective and a real image is formed\n\nin the tube at its second focal point. The eyepiece magnifies this image\n\nproducing a final inverted image. The magnifying power m is the ratio of\n\nthe angle β subtended at the eye by the final image to the angle α which\nthe object subtends at the lens or the eye.

Refracting telescopes can be used both for\n\nterrestrial and astronomical observations. For example, consider\n\na telescope whose objective has a focal length of 100 cm and the eyepiece\n\na focal length of 1 cm. The magnifying power of this telescope is\n\nm = 100/1 = 100.\n\nT\nh\n\ne\n w\n\no\nr\nld\n\n’s\n la\n\nr\ng\ne\ns\nt\n o\n\np\nt\nic\n\na\nl t\n\ne\nle\n\ns\nc\no\np\n\ne\ns\n\nh\nttp\n\n://a\nstro\n\n.n\nin\n\ne\np\nla\n\nn\ne\nts.o\n\nrg\n/b\n\nig\ne\ny\ne\ns.h\n\ntm\nl\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n340\n\nLet us consider a pair of stars of actual separation 1′ (one minute of\narc). The stars appear as though they are separated by an angle of 100 ×\n1′ = 100′ =1.67°.\n\nFIGURE 9.29  A refracting telescope.\n\nThe main considerations with an astronomical telescope are its light\n\ngathering power and its resolution or resolving power. The former clearly\n\ndepends on the area of the objective. With larger diameters, fainter objects\n\ncan be observed. The resolving power, or the ability to observe two objects\n\ndistinctly, which are in very nearly the same direction, also depends on\n\nthe diameter of the objective. So, the desirable aim in optical telescopes is\n\nto make them with objective of large diameter. The largest lens objective\n\nin use has a diameter of 40 inch (~1.02 m). It is at the Yerkes Observatory\n\nin Wisconsin, USA. Such big lenses tend to be very heavy and therefore,\n\ndifficult to make and support by their edges. Further, it is rather difficult\n\nand expensive to make such large sized lenses which form images that\n\nare free from any kind of chromatic aberration and distortions.\n\nFor these reasons, modern telescopes use a concave mirror rather\n\nthan a lens for the objective. Telescopes with mirror objectives are called\n\nreflecting telescopes. There is no chromatic aberration in a mirror.\n\nMechanical support is much less of a problem since a mirror weighs\n\nmuch less than a lens of equivalent optical quality, and can be supported\n\nover its entire back surface, not just over its rim. One obvious problem\n\nwith a reflecting telescope is that the objective mirror focusses light inside\n\nthe telescope tube. One must have an eyepiece and the observer right\n\nthere, obstructing some light (depending on the size of the observer cage).\n\nThis is what is done in the very large 200 inch (~5.08 m) diameters, Mt.\n\nPalomar telescope, California. The viewer sits near the focal point of the\n\nmirror, in a small cage. Another solution to the problem is to deflect the\n\nlight being focussed by another mirror. One such arrangement using a\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nRay Optics and\n\nOptical Instruments\n\n341\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. Reflection is governed by the equation ∠i = ∠r′   and refraction by the\nSnell’s law, sini/sinr = n, where the incident ray, reflected ray, refracted\n\nray and normal lie in the same plane. Angles of incidence, reflection\n\nand refraction are i, r ′  and r, respectively.\n\n2. The critical angle of incidence i\nc\n for a ray incident from a denser to rarer\n\nmedium, is that angle for which the angle of refraction is 90°. For\n\ni > i\nc\n, total internal reflection occurs. Multiple internal reflections in\n\ndiamond (i\nc\n  ≅  24.4°), totally reflecting prisms and mirage, are some\n\nexamples of total internal reflection. Optical fibres consist of glass\n\nfibres coated with a thin layer of material of lower refractive index.\n\nLight incident at an angle at one end comes out at the other, after\n\nmultiple internal reflections, even if the fibre is bent.\n\n3. Cartesian sign convention: Distances measured in the same direction\n\nas the incident light are positive; those measured in the opposite\n\ndirection are negative. All distances are measured from the pole/optic\n\ncentre of the mirror/lens on the principal axis. The heights measured\n\nupwards above x-axis and normal to the principal axis of the mirror/\n\nlens are taken as positive. The heights measured downwards are taken\n\nas negative.\n\nFIGURE 9.30  Schematic diagram of a reflecting telescope (Cassegrain).\n\nconvex secondary mirror to focus the incident light, which now passes\n\nthrough a hole in the objective primary mirror, is shown in Fig. 9.30.\n\nThis is known as a Cassegrain telescope, after its inventor. It has the\n\nadvantages of a large focal length in a short telescope. The largest telescope\n\nin India is in Kavalur, Tamil Nadu. It is a 2.34 m diameter reflecting\n\ntelescope (Cassegrain). It was ground, polished, set up, and is being used\n\nby the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore.

The laws of reflection and refraction are true for all surfaces and\n\npairs of media at the point of the incidence.\n\n2. The real image of an object placed between f and 2f from a convex lens\n\ncan be seen on a screen placed at the image location. If the screen is\n\nremoved, is the image still there?  This question puzzles many, because\n\nit is difficult to reconcile ourselves with an image suspended in air\n\nwithout a screen. But the image does exist. Rays from a given point\n\non the object are converging to an image point in space and diverging\n\naway. The screen simply diffuses these rays, some of which reach our\n\neye and we see the image. This can be seen by the images formed in\n\nair during a laser show.\n\n3. Image formation needs regular reflection/refraction. In principle, all\n\nrays from a given point should reach the same image point. This is\n\nwhy you do not see your image by an irregular reflecting object, say\n\nthe page of a book.\n\n4. Thick lenses give coloured images due to dispersion. The variety in\n\ncolour of objects we see around us is due to the constituent colours\n\nof the light incident on them. A monochromatic light may produce an\n\nentirely different perception about the colours on an object as seen in\n\nwhite light.\n\n5. For a simple microscope, the angular size of the object equals the\n\nangular size of the image. Yet it offers magnification because we can\n\nkeep the small object much closer to the eye than 25 cm and hence\n\nhave it subtend a large angle. The image is at 25 cm which we can see.\n\nWithout the microscope, you would need to keep the small object at\n\n25 cm which would subtend a very small angle.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n344\n\nEXERCISES\n\n9.1 A small candle, 2.5 cm in size is placed at 27 cm in front of a concave\nmirror of radius of curvature 36 cm.

It explained the laws of reflection and refraction of light at an interface.\nThe corpuscular model predicted that if the ray of light (on refraction)\nbends towards the normal then the speed of light would be greater in the\nsecond medium. This corpuscular model of light was further developed\nby Isaac Newton in his famous book entitled OPTICKS and because of\nthe tremendous popularity of this book, the corpuscular model is very\noften attributed to Newton.\n\nIn 1678, the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens put forward the\nwave theory of light – it is this wave model of light that we will discuss in\nthis chapter. As we will see, the wave model could satisfactorily explain\nthe phenomena of reflection and refraction; however, it predicted that on\nrefraction if the wave bends towards the normal then the speed of light\nwould be less in the second medium. This is in contradiction to the\nprediction made by using the corpuscular model of light. It was much\nlater confirmed by experiments where it was shown that the speed of\nlight in water is less than the speed in air confirming the prediction of the\nwave model; Foucault carried out this experiment in 1850.\n\nThe wave theory was not readily accepted primarily because of\nNewton’s authority and also because light could travel through vacuum\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n352\n\nand it was felt that a wave would always require a medium to propagate\nfrom one point to the other. However, when Thomas Young performed\nhis famous interference experiment in 1801, it was firmly established\nthat light is indeed a wave phenomenon. The wavelength of visible\nlight was measured and found to be extremely small; for example, the\nwavelength of yellow light is about 0.6 µm. Because of the smallness\nof the wavelength of visible light (in comparison to the dimensions of\ntypical mirrors and lenses), light can be assumed to approximately\ntravel in straight lines. This is the field of geometrical optics, which we\nhad discussed in the previous chapter. Indeed, the branch of optics in\nwhich one completely neglects the finiteness of the wavelength is called\ngeometrical optics and a ray is defined as the path of energy\npropagation in the limit of wavelength tending to zero.\n\nAfter the interference experiment of Young in 1801, for the next 40\nyears or so, many experiments were carried out involving the\ninterference and diffraction of lightwaves; these experiments could only\nbe satisfactorily explained by assuming a wave model of light. Thus,\naround the middle of the nineteenth century, the wave theory seemed\nto be very well established. The only major difficulty was that since it\nwas thought that a wave required a medium for its propagation, how\ncould light waves propagate through vacuum. This was explained\nwhen Maxwell put forward his famous electromagnetic theory of light.\nMaxwell had developed a set of equations describing the laws of\nelectricity and magnetism and using these equations he derived what\nis known as the wave equation from which he predicted the existence\nof electromagnetic waves*. From the wave equation, Maxwell could\ncalculate the speed of electromagnetic waves in free space and he found\nthat the theoretical value was very close to the measured value of speed\nof l ight. From this, he propounded that l ight must be an\nelectromagnetic wave. Thus, according to Maxwell, light waves are\nassociated with changing electric and magnetic fields; changing electric\nfield produces a time and space varying magnetic field and a changing\nmagnetic field produces a time and space varying electric field. The\nchanging electric and magnetic fields result in the propagation of\nelectromagnetic waves (or light waves) even in vacuum.\n\nIn this chapter we will first discuss the original formulation of the\nHuygens principle and derive the laws of reflection and refraction. In\nSections 10.4 and 10.5, we will discuss the phenomenon of interference\nwhich is based on the principle of superposition. In Section 10.6 we\nwill discuss the phenomenon of diffraction which is based on Huygens-\nFresnel principle. Finally in Section 10.7 we will discuss the\nphenomenon of polarisation which is based on the fact that the light\nwaves are transverse electromagnetic waves.\n\n* Maxwell had predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves around 1855; it\nwas much later (around 1890) that Heinrich Hertz produced radiowaves in the\nlaboratory. J.C. Bose and G. Marconi made practical applications of the Hertzian\nwaves\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n353\n\nWave Optics\n\n10.2  HUYGENS PRINCIPLE\nWe would first define a wavefront: when we drop a small stone on a calm\npool of water, waves spread out from the point of impact. Every point on\nthe surface starts oscillating with time. At any instant, a photograph of\nthe surface would show circular rings on which the disturbance is\nmaximum. Clearly, all points on such a circle are oscillating in phase\nbecause they are at the same distance from the source. Such a locus of\npoints, which oscillate in phase is called a wavefront ; thus a wavefront\nis defined as a surface of constant phase. The speed with which the\nwavefront moves outwards from the source is called the speed of the\nwave. The energy of the wave travels in a direction perpendicular to the\nwavefront.\n\nIf we have a point source emitting waves uniformly in all directions,\nthen the locus of points which have the same amplitude and vibrate in\nthe same phase are spheres and we have what is known as a spherical\nwave as shown in Fig. 10.1(a). At a large distance from the source, a\n\nDOES LIGHT TRAVEL IN A STRAIGHT LINE?\n\nLight travels in a straight line in Class VI; it does not do so in Class XII and beyond! Surprised,\naren’t you?\n\nIn school, you are shown an experiment in which you take three cardboards with\npinholes in them, place a candle on one side and look from the other side. If the flame of the\ncandle and the three pinholes are in a straight line, you can see the candle. Even if one of\nthem is displaced a little, you cannot see the candle. This proves, so your teacher says,\nthat light travels in a straight line.\n\nIn the present book, there are two consecutive chapters, one on ray optics and the other\non wave optics. Ray optics is based on rectilinear propagation of light, and deals with\nmirrors, lenses, reflection, refraction, etc. Then you come to the chapter on wave optics,\nand you are told that light travels as a wave, that it can bend around objects, it can diffract\nand interfere, etc.\n\nIn optical region, light has a wavelength of about half a micrometre. If it encounters an\nobstacle of about this size, it can bend around it and can be seen on the other side. Thus a\nmicrometre size obstacle will not be able to stop a light ray. If the obstacle is much larger,\nhowever, light will not be able to bend to that extent, and will not be seen on the other side.\n\nThis is a property of a wave in general, and can be seen in sound waves too. The sound\nwave of our speech has a wavelength of about 50cm to 1 m. If it meets an obstacle of the\nsize of a few metres, it bends around it and reaches points behind the obstacle. But when it\ncomes across a larger obstacle of a few hundred metres, such as a hillock, most of it is\nreflected and is heard as an echo.\n\nThen what about the primary school experiment? What happens there is that when we\nmove any cardboard, the displacement is of the order of a few millimetres, which is much\nlarger than the wavelength of light. Hence the candle cannot be seen. If we are able to move\none of the cardboards by a micrometer or less, light will be able to diffract, and the candle\nwill still be seen.\n\nOne could add to the first sentence in this box: It learns how to bend as it grows up!\n\nFIGURE 10.1 (a) A\ndiverging spherical\n\nwave emanating from\na point source. The\n\nwavefronts are\nspherical.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n354\n\nsmall portion of the sphere can be considered as a plane and we have\nwhat is known as a plane wave [Fig. 10.1(b)].\n\nNow, if we know the shape of the wavefront at t = 0, then Huygens\nprinciple allows us to determine the shape of the wavefront at a later\ntime τ. Thus, Huygens principle is essentially a geometrical construction,\nwhich given the shape of the wafefront at any time allows us to determine\nthe shape of the wavefront at a later time. Let us consider a diverging\nwave and let F1F2 represent a portion of the spherical wavefront at t = 0\n(Fig. 10.2). Now, according to Huygens principle, each point of the\nwavefront is the source of a secondary disturbance and the wavelets\n\nemanating from these points spread out in all directions with the speed\n\nof the wave. These wavelets emanating from the wavefront are usually\n\nreferred to as secondary wavelets and if we draw a common tangent\n\nto all these spheres, we obtain the new position of the wavefront at a\n\nlater time.\n\nFIGURE 10.1 (b) At a\nlarge distance from\nthe source, a small\n\nportion of the\nspherical wave can\n\nbe approximated by a\nplane wave.\n\nFIGURE 10.2 F\n1\nF\n\n2\n represents the spherical wavefront (with O as\n\ncentre) at t = 0. The envelope of the secondary wavelets\nemanating from F\n\n1\nF\n\n2\n produces the forward moving  wavefront G\n\n1\nG\n\n2\n.\n\nThe backwave D\n1\nD\n\n2\n does not exist.\n\nThus, if we wish to determine the shape of the wavefront at t = τ, we\ndraw spheres of radius vτ from each point on the spherical wavefront\nwhere v represents the speed of the waves in the medium. If we now draw\na common tangent to all these spheres, we obtain the new position of the\nwavefront at t = τ.  The new wavefront shown as G1G2 in Fig. 10.2 is again\nspherical with point O as the centre.\n\nThe above model has one shortcoming: we also have a backwave which\nis shown as D1D2 in Fig. 10.2. Huygens argued that the amplitude of the\nsecondary wavelets is maximum in the forward direction and zero in the\nbackward direction; by making this adhoc assumption, Huygens could\nexplain the absence of the backwave. However, this adhoc assumption is\nnot satisfactory and the absence of the backwave is really justified from\nmore rigorous wave theory.\n\nIn a similar manner, we can use Huygens principle to determine the\nshape of the wavefront for a plane wave propagating through a medium\n(Fig. 10.3).\n\nFIGURE 10.3\n\nHuygens geometrical\nconstruction for a\n\nplane wave\npropagating to the\nright.

Let PP′ represent the surface separating medium\n1 and medium 2, as shown in Fig. 10.4. Let v1 and v2\nrepresent the speed of light in medium 1 and medium 2,\nrespectively. We assume a plane wavefront AB propagating\nin the direction A′A incident on the interface at an angle i\nas shown in the figure. Let τ be the time taken by the\nwavefront to travel the distance BC. Thus,\n\nBC = v1 τ\n\nIn order to determine the shape of the refracted wavefront, we draw a\nsphere of radius v\n\n2\nτ from the point A in the second medium (the speed of\n\nthe wave in the second medium is v2). Let CE represent a tangent plane\ndrawn from the point C on to the sphere. Then, AE = v\n\n2 \nτ   and CE would\n\nrepresent the refracted wavefront.  If we now consider the triangles ABC\nand AEC, we readily obtain\n\nsin i = \n1BC\n\nAC AC\nv τ\n\n= (10.1)\n\nand\n\nsin r = \n2AE\n\nAC AC\nv τ\n\n= (10.2)\n\nwhere i and r are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n\nFIGURE 10.4 A plane wave AB is incident at an angle i\non the surface PP′  separating medium 1 and medium 2.\nThe plane wave undergoes refraction and CE represents\nthe refracted wavefront. The figure corresponds to v\n\n2\n < v\n\n1\n\nso that the refracted waves bends towards the normal.\n\nC\nH\n\nR\nIS\n\nT\nIA\n\nA\nN\n\n H\nU\n\nY\nG\n\nE\nN\n\nS\n (1\n\n6\n2\n9\n – 1\n\n6\n9\n5\n)\n\nChristiaan Huygens\n(1629 – 1695) Dutch\nphysicist, astronomer,\nmathematician and the\nfounder of the wave\ntheory of light. His book,\nTreatise on light, makes\nfascinating reading even\ntoday. He brilliantly\nexplained the double\nrefraction shown by the\nmineral calcite in this\nwork in addition to\nreflection and refraction.\nHe was the first to\nanalyse circular and\nsimple harmonic motion\nand designed and built\nimproved clocks and\ntelescopes. He discovered\nthe true geometry of\nSaturn’s rings.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n356\n\nThus we obtain\n\n1\n\n2\n\nsin\nsin\n\ni v\n\nr v\n= (10.3)\n\nFrom the above equation, we get the important result that if r < i (i.e.,\nif the ray bends toward the normal), the speed of the light wave in the\nsecond medium (v\n\n2\n) will be less then the speed of the light wave in the\n\nfirst medium (v\n1\n). This prediction is opposite to the prediction from the\n\ncorpuscular model of light and as later experiments showed, the prediction\nof the wave theory is correct. Now, if c represents the speed of light in\nvacuum, then,\n\n1\n1\n\nc\nn\n\nv\n= (10.4)\n\nand\n\nn\n2\n = \n\n2\n\nc\n\nv\n(10.5)\n\nare known as the refractive indices of medium 1 and medium 2,\nrespectively. In terms of the refractive indices, Eq. (10.3) can be\nwritten as\n\nn1 sin i = n2 sin r (10.6)\n\nThis is the Snell’s law of refraction. Further, if  λ\n1\n and λ\n\n 2\n denote the\n\nwavelengths of light in medium 1 and medium 2, respectively and if the\ndistance BC is equal to λ\n\n 1\n then the distance AE will be equal to λ\n\n 2\n (because\n\nif the crest from B has reached C in time τ, then the crest from A should\nhave also reached E in time τ ); thus,\n\n1 1\n\n2 2\n\nBC\nAE\n\nv\n\nv\n\nλ\nλ\n\n= =\n\nor\n\n1 2\n\n1 2\n\nv v\n\nλ λ\n= (10.7)\n\nThe above equation implies that when a wave gets refracted into a\ndenser medium (v1 > v2) the wavelength and the speed of propagation\ndecrease but the frequency  ν (= v/λ) remains the same.\n\n10.3.2  Refraction at a rarer medium\n\nWe now consider refraction of a plane wave at a rarer medium, i.e.,\nv2 > v1. Proceeding in an exactly similar manner we can construct a\nrefracted wavefront as shown in Fig. 10.5. The angle of refraction\nwill now be greater than angle of incidence; however, we will still have\nn\n\n1\n sin i = n\n\n2\n sin r . We define an angle i\n\nc\n by the following equation\n\n2\n\n1\n\nsin c\nn\n\ni\nn\n\n= (10.8)\n\nThus, if i = i\nc\n then sin r = 1 and r = 90°. Obviously, for i > i\n\nc\n, there can\n\nnot be any refracted wave. The angle i\nc \nis known as the critical angle and\n\nfor all angles of incidence greater than the critical angle, we will not have\n\nD\ne\nm\n\no\nn\n\ns\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n \no\n\nf \nin\n\nte\nr\nfe\n\nr\ne\nn\n\nc\ne\n, \n\nd\nif\n\nfr\na\nc\nti\n\no\nn\n\n, \nr\ne\nfr\n\na\nc\nti\n\no\nn\n\n, \nr\ne\ns\no\n\nn\na\nn\n\nc\ne\n \na\nn\n\nd\n \nD\n\no\np\n\np\nle\n\nr\n \ne\nff\n\ne\nc\nt\n\nh\ntt\np\n:/\n/w\n\nw\nw\n\n.f\na\nls\n\nta\nd\n.c\n\no\nm\n\n/r\nip\n\np\nle\n\n/\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n357\n\nWave Optics\n\nany refracted wave and the wave will undergo what is known as total\ninternal reflection. The phenomenon of total internal reflection and its\napplications was discussed in Section 9.4.\n\nFIGURE 10.5 Refraction of a plane wave incident on a rarer medium for\nwhich v\n\n2\n > v\n\n1\n. The plane wave bends away from the normal.\n\n10.3.3  Reflection of a plane wave by a plane surface\n\nWe next consider a plane wave AB incident at an angle i on a reflecting\nsurface MN. If v represents the speed of the wave in the medium and if τ\nrepresents the time taken by the wavefront to advance from the point B\nto C then the distance\n\nBC =  vτ\n\nIn order to construct the reflected wavefront we draw a sphere of radius\nvτ from the point A as shown in Fig. 10.6. Let CE represent the tangent\nplane drawn from the point C to this sphere. Obviously\n\nAE = BC = vτ\n\nFIGURE 10.6 Reflection of a plane wave AB by the reflecting surface MN.\nAB and CE represent incident and reflected wavefronts.\n\nIf we now consider the triangles EAC and BAC we will find that they\nare congruent and therefore, the angles i and r (as shown in Fig. 10.6)\nwould be equal. This is the law of reflection.\n\nOnce we have the laws of reflection and refraction, the behaviour of\nprisms, lenses, and mirrors can be understood. These phenomena were\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n358\n\ndiscussed in detail in Chapter 9 on the basis of rectilinear propagation of\nlight. Here we just describe the behaviour of the wavefronts as they\nundergo reflection or refraction. In Fig. 10.7(a) we consider a plane wave\npassing through a thin prism. Clearly, since the speed of light waves is\nless in glass, the lower portion of the incoming wavefront (which travels\nthrough the greatest thickness of glass) will get delayed resulting in a tilt\nin the emerging wavefront as shown in the figure. In Fig. 10.7(b) we\nconsider a plane wave incident on a thin convex lens; the central part of\nthe incident plane wave traverses the thickest portion of the lens and is\ndelayed the most. The emerging wavefront has a depression at the centre\nand therefore the wavefront becomes spherical and converges to the point\nF which is known as the focus. In Fig. 10.7(c) a plane wave is incident on\na concave mirror and on reflection we have a spherical wave converging\nto the focal point F. In a similar manner, we can understand refraction\nand reflection by concave lenses and convex mirrors.\n\nFIGURE 10.7 Refraction of a plane wave by (a) a thin prism, (b) a convex lens. (c) Reflection of a\nplane wave by a  concave mirror.\n\nFrom the above discussion it follows that the total time taken from a\npoint on the object to the corresponding point on the image is the same\nmeasured along any ray. For example, when a convex lens focusses light\nto form a real image, although the ray going through the centre traverses\na shorter path, but because of the slower speed in glass, the time taken\nis the same as for rays travelling near the edge of the lens.\n\n10.3.4  The doppler effect\n\nWe should mention here that one should be careful in constructing the\nwavefronts if the source (or the observer) is moving. For example, if there\nis no medium and the source moves away from the observer, then later\nwavefronts have to travel a greater distance to reach the observer and\nhence take a longer time. The time taken between the arrival of two\nsuccessive wavefronts is hence longer at the observer than it is at the\nsource. Thus, when the source moves away from the observer the\nfrequency as measured by the source will be smaller. This is known as\nthe Doppler effect. Astronomers call the increase in wavelength due to\ndoppler effect as  red shift since a wavelength in the middle of the visible\nregion of the spectrum moves towards the red end of the spectrum. When\nwaves are received from a source moving towards the observer, there is\nan apparent decrease in wavelength, this is referred to as blue shift.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n359\n\nWave Optics\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n0\n.1\n\nYou have already encountered Doppler effect for sound waves in\nChapter 15 of Class XI textbook. For velocities small compared to the\nspeed of light, we can use the same formulae which we use for sound\nwaves. The fractional change in frequency ∆ν/ν is given by –v\n\nradial\n/c, where\n\nvradial is the component of the source velocity along the line joining the\nobserver to the source relative to the observer; v\n\nradial \nis considered positive\n\nwhen the source moves away from the observer. Thus, the Doppler shift\ncan be expressed as:\n\n– radial\nv\n\nc\n\nν\nν\n\n∆\n= (10.9)\n\nThe formula given above is valid only when the speed of the source is\nsmall compared to that of light. A more accurate formula for the Doppler\neffect which is valid even when the speeds are close to that of light, requires\nthe use of Einstein’s special theory of relativity. The Doppler effect for\nlight is very important in astronomy. It is the basis for the measurements\nof the radial velocities of distant galaxies.\n\nExample 10.1 What speed should a galaxy move with respect\nto us so that the sodium line at 589.0 nm is observed\nat 589.6 nm?\n\nSolution  Since νλ = c,  –\nν λ\n\nν λ\n∆ ∆\n\n=  (for small changes in ν and λ). For\n\n∆λ = 589.6 – 589.0 = + 0.6 nm\n\nwe get [using Eq.

Explain why?\n\n(b) When light travels from a rarer to a denser medium, the speed\ndecreases. Does the reduction in speed imply a reduction in the\nenergy carried by the light wave?\n\n(c) In the wave picture of light, intensity of light is determined by the\nsquare of the amplitude of the wave. What determines the intensity\nof light in the photon picture of light.\n\nSolution\n(a) Reflection and refraction arise through interaction of incident light\n\nwith the atomic constituents of matter.

Thus, the frequency of\nscattered light equals the frequency of incident light.\n\n(b) No. Energy carried by a wave depends on the amplitude of the\nwave, not on the speed of wave propagation.\n\n(c) For a given frequency, intensity of light in the photon picture is\ndetermined by the number of photons crossing an unit area per\nunit time.\n\n10.4  COHERENT AND INCOHERENT ADDITION OF WAVES\nIn this section we will discuss the interference pattern produced by\nthe superposition of two waves. You may recall that we had discussed\nthe superposition principle in Chapter 15 of your Class XI textbook.\nIndeed the entire field of interference is based on the superposition\nprinciple according to which at a particular point in the medium, the\nresultant displacement produced by a number of waves is the vector\n\nsum of the displacements produced by each of the waves.\nConsider two needles S\n\n1\n and S\n\n2\n moving periodically up and down\n\nin an identical fashion in a trough of water [Fig. 10.8(a)]. They produce\ntwo water waves, and at a particular point, the phase difference between\nthe displacements produced by each of the waves does not change\nwith time; when this happens the two sources are said to be coherent.\nFigure 10.8(b) shows the position of crests (solid circles) and troughs\n(dashed circles) at a given instant of time. Consider a point P for which\n\nS\n1\n P = S\n\n2\n P\n\nSince the distances S\n1\n P and S\n\n2\n P are equal, waves from S\n\n1\n and S\n\n2\nwill take the same time to travel to the point P and waves that emanate\nfrom S\n\n1\n and S\n\n2\n in phase will also arrive, at the point P, in phase.\n\nThus, if the displacement produced by the source S1 at the point P\nis given by\n\ny\n1\n = a cos ωt\n\nthen, the displacement produced by the source S\n2\n (at the point P) will\n\nalso be given by\n\ny2 = a cos ωt\n\nThus, the resultant of displacement at P would be given by\n\ny = y\n1\n + y\n\n2\n = 2 a cos ωt\n\nSince the intensity is proportional to the square of the amplitude,\nthe resultant intensity will be given by\n\nI = 4 I0\nwhere I\n\n0\n represents the intensity produced by each one of the individual\n\nsources; I0 is proportional to a\n2. In fact at any point on the perpendicular\n\nbisector of S1S2, the intensity will be 4I0. The two sources are said to\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFIGURE 10.8 (a) Two\nneedles oscillating in\n\nphase in water\nrepresent two coherent\n\nsources.\n(b) The pattern of\n\ndisplacement of water\nmolecules at an\n\ninstant on the surface\nof water showing nodal\n\nN (no displacement)\nand antinodal A\n\n(maximum\ndisplacement) lines.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n361\n\nWave Optics\n\ninterfere constructively and we have what is referred to as constructive\ninterference. We next consider a point Q [Fig. 10.9(a)]\nfor which\n\nS2Q –S1Q = 2λ\n\nThe waves emanating from S1 will arrive exactly two cycles earlier\nthan the waves from S\n\n2\n and will again be in phase [Fig. 10.9(a)]. Thus, if\n\nthe displacement produced by  S1  is given by\n\ny\n1\n = a cos ωt\n\nthen the displacement produced by  S\n2 \n will be given by\n\ny\n2\n = a cos (ωt – 4π)  =  a cos ωt\n\nwhere we have used the fact that a path difference of 2λ corresponds to a\nphase difference of 4π. The two displacements are once again in phase\nand the intensity will again be 4 I0 giving rise to constructive interference.\nIn the above analysis we have assumed that the distances S1Q and S2Q\nare much greater than d (which represents the distance between S\n\n1\n and\n\nS2) so that although S1Q and S2Q are not equal, the amplitudes of the\ndisplacement produced by each wave are very nearly the same.\n\nWe next consider a point R [Fig. 10.9(b)] for which\n\nS\n2\nR – S\n\n1\nR = –2.5λ\n\nThe waves emanating from S\n1 \nwill arrive exactly two and a half cycles\n\nlater than the waves from S2  [Fig. 10.10(b)]. Thus if the displacement\nproduced by  S1  is given by\n\ny1 = a cos ωt\n\nthen the displacement produced by  S2  will be given by\n\ny2 = a cos (ωt + 5π)  = – a cos ωt\n\nwhere we have used the fact that a path difference of 2.5λ corresponds to\na phase difference of 5π. The two displacements are now out of phase\nand the two displacements will cancel out to give zero intensity. This is\nreferred to as destructive interference.\n\nTo summarise: If we have two coherent sources S1 and S2 vibrating\nin phase, then for an arbitrary point P whenever the path difference,\n\nS1P  ~ S2P =  nλ     (n = 0, 1, 2, 3,...) (10.10)\n\nwe will have constructive interference and the resultant intensity will be\n4I\n\n0\n; the sign ~ between  S\n\n1\nP and S\n\n2\n P represents the difference between\n\nS\n1\nP and S\n\n2\n P. On the other hand, if the point P is such that the path\n\ndifference,\n\nS\n1\nP  ~ S\n\n2\nP = (n+\n\n1\n2\n\n) λ     (n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...) (10.11)\n\nwe will have destructive interference and the resultant intensity will be\nzero. Now, for any other arbitrary point G (Fig. 10.10) let the phase\ndifference between the two displacements be φ. Thus, if the displacement\nproduced by S1 is given by\n\ny\n1\n = a cos ωt\n\nFIGURE 10.9\n\n(a) Constructive\ninterference at a\n\npoint Q for which the\npath difference is 2λ.\n\n(b) Destructive\ninterference at a\n\npoint R for which the\npath difference is\n\n2.5 λ .\n\nFIGURE 10.10 Locus\nof points for which\n\nS\n1\nP – S\n\n2\nP is equal to\n\nzero, ±λ, ± 2λ, ± 3λ .\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n362\n\nthen, the displacement produced by S\n2\n would be\n\ny\n2\n = a cos (ωt + φ )\n\nand the resultant displacement will be given by\ny = y1 + y2\n   = a [cos ωt + cos (ωt +φ )]\n\n   = 2 a cos (φ/2) cos (ωt + φ/2)\n\nThe amplitude of the resultant displacement is 2a cos (φ/2) and\ntherefore the intensity at that point will be\n\nI = 4 I0 cos\n2 (φ/2) (10.12)\n\nIf φ = 0, ± 2 π, ± 4 π,… which corresponds to the condition given by\nEq. (10.10) we will have constructive interference leading to maximum\nintensity. On the other hand, if φ = ± π, ± 3π, ± 5π … [which corresponds to\nthe condition given by Eq. (10.11)] we will have destructive interference\nleading to zero intensity.\n\nNow if the two sources are coherent (i.e., if the two needles are going\nup and down regularly) then the phase difference φ at any point will not\nchange with time and we will have a stable interference pattern; i.e., the\npositions of maxima and minima will not change with time. However, if\nthe two needles do not maintain a constant phase difference, then the\ninterference pattern will also change with time and, if the phase difference\nchanges very rapidly with time, the positions of maxima and minima will\nalso vary rapidly with time and we will see a “time-averaged” intensity\ndistribution. When this happens, we will observe an average intensity\nthat will be given by\n\n( )204 cos /2I I φ< >= < > (10.13)\nwhere angular brackets represent time averaging. Indeed it is shown in\nSection 7.2 that if φ (t ) varies randomly with time, the time-averaged\nquantity < cos2 (φ/2) > will be 1/2. This is also intuitively obvious because\nthe function cos2 (φ/2)  will randomly vary between 0 and 1 and the\naverage value will be 1/2. The resultant intensity will be given by\n\nI = 2 I0 (10.14)\n\nat all points.\nWhen the phase difference between the two vibrating sources changes\n\nrapidly with time, we say that the two sources are incoherent and when\nthis happens the intensities just add up. This is indeed what happens\nwhen two separate light sources illuminate a wall.\n\n10.5 INTERFERENCE OF LIGHT WAVES AND YOUNG’S\nEXPERIMENT\n\nWe will now discuss interference using light waves. If we use two sodium\nlamps illuminating two pinholes (Fig. 10.11) we will not observe any\ninterference fringes. This is because of the fact that the light wave emitted\nfrom an ordinary source (like a sodium lamp) undergoes abrupt phase\n\nR\nip\n\np\nle\n\n T\na\nn\nk\n e\n\nx\np\ne\nri\n\nm\ne\nn\nts\n\n o\nn\n w\n\na\nv\ne\n i\nn\nte\n\nrf\ne\nre\n\nn\nc\ne\n\nh\ntt\np\n:/\n/p\n\nh\ne\nt.\nc\no\nlo\n\nra\nd\no\n.e\n\nd\nu\n/e\n\nn\n/s\n\nim\nu\nla\n\nti\no\nn\n/l\ne\ng\na\nc\ny\n/w\n\na\nv\ne\n-i\nn\nte\n\nrf\ne\nre\n\nn\nc\ne\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n363\n\nWave Optics\n\nchanges in times of the order of 10–10 seconds. Thus\nthe light waves coming out from two independent\nsources of light will not have any fixed phase\nrelationship and would be incoherent, when this\nhappens, as discussed in the previous section, the\nintensities on the screen will add up.\n\nThe British physicist Thomas Young used an\ningenious technique to “lock” the phases of the waves\nemanating from S\n\n1\n and S\n\n2\n. He made two pinholes S\n\n1\nand S\n\n2\n (very close to each other) on an opaque screen\n\n[Fig. 10.12(a)]. These were illuminated by another\npinholes that was in turn, lit by a bright source. Light\nwaves spread out from S and fall on both S\n\n1\n and S\n\n2\n.\n\nS1 and S2 then behave like two coherent sources\nbecause light waves coming out from S\n\n1\n and S\n\n2\n are derived from the\n\nsame original source and any abrupt phase change in S will manifest in\nexactly similar phase changes in the light coming out from S1 and S2.\nThus, the two sources S\n\n1\n and S\n\n2\n will be locked in phase; i.e., they will be\n\ncoherent like the two vibrating needle in our water wave example\n[Fig. 10.8(a)].\n\nFIGURE 10.11 If two sodium\nlamps illuminate two pinholes\n\nS\n1\n and S\n\n2\n, the intensities will add\n\nup and no interference fringes will\nbe observed on the screen.\n\nThus spherical waves emanating from S\n1\n and S\n\n2\n will produce\n\ninterference fringes on the screen GG′, as shown in Fig. 10.12(b). The\npositions of maximum and minimum intensities can be calculated by\nusing the analysis given in Section 10.4 where we had shown that for an\narbitrary point P on the line GG′ [Fig. 10.12(b)] to correspond to a\nmaximum, we must have\n\nS\n2\nP – S\n\n1\nP = nλ;    n = 0, 1, 2 ...

Obviously, the central point\nO (in Fig. 10.12) will be bright because S\n\n1\nO = S\n\n2\nO and it will correspond\n\nto n = 0 [Eq. (10.18)]. If we consider the line perpendicular to the plane\nof the paper and passing through O [i.e., along the y-axis] then all points\non this line will be equidistant from S\n\n1\n and S\n\n2\n and we will have a bright\n\ncentral fringe which is a straight line as shown in Fig. 10.13.  In order\nto determine the shape of the interference pattern on the screen we note\nthat a particular fringe would correspond to the locus of points with a\nconstant value of S2P – S1P. Whenever this constant  is an integral\nmultiple of λ, the fringe will be bright and whenever it is an odd integral\nmultiple of λ/2 it will be a dark fringe. Now, the locus of the point P\nlying in the x-y plane such that S\n\n2\nP – S\n\n1\nP (= ∆) is a constant, is a\n\nhyperbola. Thus the fringe pattern will strictly be a hyperbola; however,\nif the distance D is very large compared to the fringe width, the fringes\nwill be very nearly straight lines as shown in Fig. 10.13.\n\nThomas Young\n(1773 – 1829)  English\nphysicist, physician and\nEgyptologist. Young worked\non a wide variety of\nscientific problems, ranging\nfrom the structure of the eye\nand the mechanism of\nvision to the decipherment\nof the Rosetta stone. He\nrevived the wave theory of\nlight and recognised that\ninterference phenomena\nprovide proof of the wave\nproperties of light.\n\nT\nH\n\nO\nM\n\nA\nS\n\n Y\nO\n\nU\nN\n\nG\n (\n1\n7\n7\n3\n –\n\n 1\n8\n2\n9\n)\n\nwhere S1S2 = d and OP = x.

He let a ray of sunlight into a dark room, placed a\ndark screen in front of it, pierced with two small pinholes, and\nbeyond this, at some distance, a white screen. He then saw two\ndarkish lines at both sides of a bright line, which gave him\nsufficient encouragement to repeat the experiment, this time with\nspirit flame as light source, with a little salt in it to produce the\nbright yellow sodium light. This time he saw a number of dark\nlines, regularly spaced; the first clear proof that light added to\nlight can produce darkness. This phenomenon is called\n\nFIGURE 10.13 Computer generated fringe pattern produced by two point source S\n1\n and S\n\n2\n on the\n\nscreen GG′ (Fig. 10.12); (a) and (b) correspond to d = 0.005 mm and 0.025 mm, respectively (both\nfigures correspond to D = 5 cm and λ = 5 × 10–5 cm.)

What happens if the source S is slightly away\nfrom the perpendicular bisector. Consider that the source is moved to\nsome new point S′ and suppose that Q is the mid-point of S\n\n1\n and S\n\n2\n. If\n\nthe angle S′QS is φ, then the central bright fringe occurs at an angle –φ,\non the other side. Thus, if the source S is on the perpendicular bisector,\nthen the central fringe occurs at O, also on the perpendicular bisector. If\nS is shifted by an angle φ to point S′, then the central fringe appears at a\npoint O′ at an angle –φ, which means that it is shifted by the same angle\non the other side of the bisector. This also means that the source S′, the\nmid-point Q and the point O′ of the central fringe are in a straight line.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n366\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n0\n.3\n\ninterference.

If we had slits instead of the point sources\n(Fig. 10.14), each pair of points would have produced straight line fringes\nresulting in straight line fringes with increased intensities.\n\nExample 10.3 Two slits are made one millimetre apart and the screen\nis placed one metre away.

The actual   separation of the fringes increases in\nproportion to the distance of the screen from the plane of the\ntwo slits.\n\n(b) The separation of the fringes (and also angular separation)\ndecreases.

See, however, the condition mentioned in (d) below.\n\n(d) Let s be the size of the source and S its distance from the plane of\nthe two slits. For interference fringes to be seen, the condition\ns/S < λ/d should be satisfied; otherwise, interference patterns\nproduced by different parts of the source overlap and no fringes\nare seen. Thus, as S decreases (i.e., the source slit is brought\ncloser), the interference pattern gets less and less sharp, and\nwhen the source is brought too close for this condition to be valid,\nthe fringes disappear. Till this happens, the fringe separation\nremains fixed.\n\n(e) Same as in (d). As the source slit width increases, fringe pattern\ngets less and less sharp. When the source slit is so wide that the\ncondition s/S ≤ λ/d is not satisfied, the interference pattern\ndisappears.\n\n(f ) The interference patterns due to different component colours of\nwhite light overlap (incoherently). The central bright fringes for\ndifferent colours are at the same position. Therefore, the central\nfringe is white. For a point P for which S2P –S1P = λb/2, where λb\n(≈ 4000 Å) represents the wavelength for the blue colour, the blue\ncomponent will be absent and the fringe will appear red in colour.\nSlightly farther away where S2Q–S1Q = λb = λr/2 where λr (≈ 8000 Å)\nis the wavelength for the red colour, the fringe will be predominantly\nblue.\n\nThus, the fringe closest on either side of the central white fringe\nis red and the farthest will appear blue. After a few fringes, no\nclear fringe pattern is seen.\n\n10.6  DIFFRACTION\nIf we look clearly at the shadow cast by an opaque object, close to the\nregion of geometrical shadow, there are alternate dark and bright regions\njust like in interference. This happens due to the phenomenon of\ndiffraction. Diffraction is a general characteristic exhibited by all types of\nwaves, be it sound waves, light waves, water waves or matter waves. Since\nthe wavelength of light is much smaller than the dimensions of most\nobstacles; we do not encounter diffraction effects of light in everyday\nobservations. However, the finite resolution of our eye or of optical\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n368\n\ninstruments such as telescopes or microscopes is limited due to the\nphenomenon of diffraction. Indeed the colours that you see when a CD is\nviewed is due to diffraction effects. We will now discuss the phenomenon\nof diffraction.\n\n10.6.1  The single slit\n\nIn the discussion of Young’s experiment, we stated that a single narrow\nslit acts as a new source from which light spreads out. Even before Young,\nearly experimenters – including Newton – had noticed that light spreads\nout from narrow holes and slits. It seems to turn around corners and\nenter regions where we would expect a shadow. These effects, known as\ndiffraction, can only be properly understood using wave ideas. After all,\nyou are hardly surprised to hear sound waves from someone talking\naround a corner!\n\nWhen the double slit in Young’s experiment is replaced by a single\nnarrow slit (illuminated by a monochromatic source), a broad pattern\nwith a central bright region is seen. On both sides, there are alternate\ndark and bright regions, the intensity becoming weaker away from the\ncentre (Fig. 10.16). To understand this, go to Fig. 10.15, which shows a\nparallel beam of light falling normally on a single slit LN of width a. The\ndiffracted light goes on to meet a screen. The midpoint of the slit is M.\n\nA straight line through M perpendicular to the slit plane meets the\nscreen at C. We want the intensity at any point P on the screen. As before,\nstraight lines joining P to the different points L,M,N, etc., can be treated as\nparallel, making an angle θ with the normal MC.\n\nThe basic idea is to divide the slit into much smaller parts, and add\ntheir contributions at P with the proper phase differences. We are treating\ndifferent parts of the wavefront at the slit as secondary sources. Because\nthe incoming wavefront is parallel to the plane of the slit, these sources\nare in phase.\n\nThe path difference NP – LP between the two edges of the slit can be\ncalculated exactly as for Young’s experiment. From Fig. 10.15,\n\nNP – LP = NQ\n\n   = a sin θ\n\n   ≈ a θ  (for smaller angles) (10.21)\n\nSimilarly, if two points M\n1\n and M\n\n2\n in the slit plane are separated by y, the\n\npath difference M2P – M1P ≈ yθ. We now have to sum up equal, coherent\ncontributions from a large number of sources, each with a different phase.\nThis calculation was made by Fresnel using integral calculus, so we omit\nit here. The main features of the diffraction pattern can be understood by\nsimple arguments.\n\nAt the central point C on the screen, the angle θ is zero. All path\ndifferences are zero and hence all the parts of the slit contribute in phase.\nThis gives maximum intensity at C. Experimental observation shown in\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n369\n\nWave Optics\n\nFig. 10.15 indicates that the intensity has a\ncentral maximum at θ = 0 and other\nsecondary maxima at θ l (n+1/2) λ/a, and\nhas minima (zero intensity) at θ l nλ/a,\nn = ±1, ±2, ±3, .... It is easy to see why it has\nminima at these values of angle. Consider\nfirst the angle θ where the path difference aθ\nis λ. Then,\n\n/aθ λ≈ . (10.22)\n\nNow, divide the slit into two equal halves\nLM and MN each of size a/2. For every point\nM\n\n1\n in LM, there is a point M\n\n2\n in MN such that\n\nM\n1\nM\n\n2\n = a/2. The path difference between M\n\n1\n and M\n\n2\n at P = M\n\n2\nP – M\n\n1\nP\n\n= θ a/2 = λ/2 for the angle chosen. This means that the contributions\nfrom M\n\n1\n and M\n\n2\n are 180° out of phase and cancel in the direction\n\nθ = λ/a. Contributions from the two halves of the slit LM and MN,\ntherefore, cancel each other. Equation (10.22) gives the angle at which\nthe intensity falls to zero. One can similarly show that the intensity is\nzero for θ = nλ/a, with n being any integer (except zero!). Notice that the\nangular size of the central maximum increases when the slit width a\ndecreases.\n\nIt is also easy to see why there are maxima at θ  = (n + 1/2) λ/a and\nwhy they go on becoming weaker and weaker with increasing n. Consider\nan angle θ = 3λ/2a which is midway between two of the dark fringes.\nDivide the slit into three equal parts. If we take the first two thirds of the\nslit, the path difference between the two ends would be\n\n2 2 3\n3 3 2\n\na\na\n\na\n\nλ\nθ λ× = × = (10.23)\n\nThe first two-thirds of the slit can therefore be divided\ninto two halves which have a λ/2 path difference. The\ncontributions of these two halves cancel in the same manner\nas described earlier. Only the remaining one-third of the\nslit contributes to the intensity at a point between the two\nminima. Clearly, this will be much weaker than the central\nmaximum (where the entire slit contributes in phase). One\ncan similarly show that there are maxima at (n + 1/2) λ/a\nwith n = 2, 3, etc. These become weaker with increasing n,\nsince only one-fifth, one-seventh, etc., of the slit contributes\nin these cases. The photograph and intensity pattern\ncorresponding to it is shown in Fig. 10.16.\n\nFIGURE 10.15  The geometry of path\ndifferences for diffraction by a single slit.\n\nThere has been prolonged discussion about difference\nbetween intereference and diffraction among scientists since\nthe discovery of these phenomena. In this context, it is\n\nFIGURE 10.16 Intensity\ndistribution and photograph of\n\nfringes due to diffraction\nat single slit.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n370\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n0\n.5\n\ninteresting to note what Richard Feynman* has said in his famous\nFeynman Lectures on Physics:\n\nNo one has ever been able to define the difference between\n\ninterference and diffraction satisfactorily. It is just a question\n\nof usage, and there is no specific, important physical difference\n\nbetween them. The best we can do is, roughly speaking, is to\n\nsay that when there are only a few sources, say two interfering\n\nsources, then the result is usually called interference, but if there\n\nis a large number of them, it seems that the word diffraction is\n\nmore often used.\n\nIn the double-slit experiment, we must note that the pattern on the\nscreen is actually a superposition of single-slit diffraction from each slit\nor hole, and the double-slit interference pattern. This is shown in\nFig. 10.17. It shows a broader diffraction peak in which there appear\nseveral fringes of smaller width due to double-slit interference. The\nnumber of interference fringes occuring in the broad diffraction peak\ndepends on the ratio d/a, that is the ratio of the distance between the\ntwo slits to the width of a slit. In the limit of a becoming very small, the\ndiffraction pattern will become very flat and we will obsrve the two-slit\ninterference pattern [see Fig. 10.13(b)].\n\n* Richand Feynman was one of the recipients of the 1965 Nobel Prize in Physics\nfor his fundamental work in quantum electrodynamics.\n\nExample 10.5 In Example 10.3, what should the width of each slit be\nto obtain 10 maxima of the double slit pattern within the central\nmaximum of the single slit pattern?\n\nSolution  We want  ,a\na\n\nλ\nθ λ θ= =\n\n10 2\nd a\n\nλ λ\n=  0 2 mm\n\n5\nd\n\na = =\n\nNotice that the wavelength of light and distance of the screen do not\nenter in the calculation of a.\n\nIn the double-slit interference experiment of Fig. 10.12, what happens\nif we close one slit?

The diffraction pattern is a\nsuperposition of a continuous family of waves originating from each\npoint on a single slit.\n\n(iii) For a single slit of width a, the first null of the interference pattern\noccurs at  an angle of λ/a. At the same angle of λ/a, we get a maximum\n(not a null) for two narrow slits separated by a distance a.\nOne must understand that both d and a have to be quite small, to be\n\nable to observe good interference and diffraction patterns. For example,\nthe separation d between the two slits must be of the order of a milimetre\nor so. The width a of each slit must be even smaller, of the order of 0.1 or\n0.2 mm.\n\nIn our discussion of Young’s experiment and the single-slit diffraction,\nwe have assumed that the screen on which the fringes are formed is at a\nlarge distance. The two or more paths from the slits to the screen were\ntreated as parallel. This situation also occurs when we place a converging\nlens after the slits and place the screen at the focus. Parallel paths from\nthe slit are combined at a single point on the screen. Note that the lens\ndoes not introduce any extra path differences in a parallel beam. This\narrangement is often used since it gives more intensity than placing the\nscreen far away. If f is the focal length of the lens, then we can easily work\nout  the size of the central bright maximum. In terms of angles, the\nseparation of the central maximum from the first null of the diffraction\npattern is λ/a . Hence, the size on the screen will be f λ/a.\n\n10.6.2  Seeing the single slit diffraction pattern\n\nIt is surprisingly easy to see the single-slit diffraction pattern for oneself.\nThe equipment needed can be found in most homes –– two razor blades\nand one clear glass electric bulb preferably with a straight filament. One\nhas to hold the two blades so that the edges are parallel and have a\nnarrow slit in between. This is easily done with the thumb and forefingers\n(Fig. 10.18).\n\nKeep the slit parallel to the filament, right in front of the eye. Use\nspectacles if you normally do. With slight adjustment of the width of the\nslit and the parallelism of the edges, the pattern should be seen with its\nbright and dark bands. Since the position of all the bands (except the\ncentral one) depends on wavelength, they will show some colours. Using\na filter for red or blue will make the fringes clearer. With both filters\navailable, the wider fringes for red compared to blue can be seen.\n\nFIGURE 10.18\n\nHolding two blades to\nform a single slit. A\nbulb filament viewed\nthrough this shows\n\nclear diffraction\nbands.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n372\n\nIn this experiment, the filament plays the role of the first slit S in\nFig. 10.16. The lens of the eye focuses the pattern on the screen (the\nretina of the eye).\n\nWith some effort, one can cut a double slit in an aluminium foil with\na blade. The bulb filament can be viewed as before to repeat Young’s\nexperiment. In daytime, there is another suitable bright source subtending\na small angle at the eye. This is the reflection of the Sun in any shiny\nconvex surface (e.g., a cycle bell). Do not try direct sunlight – it can damage\nthe eye and will not give fringes anyway as the Sun subtends an angle\nof (1/2)°.\n\nIn interference and diffraction, light energy is redistributed. If it\n\nreduces in one region, producing a dark fringe, it increases in another\n\nregion, producing a bright fringe. There is no gain or loss of energy,\n\nwhich is consistent with the principle of conservation of energy.\n\n10.6.3  Resolving power of optical instruments\n\nIn Chapter 9 we had discussed about telescopes. The angular resolution\nof the telescope is determined by the objective of the telescope. The stars\nwhich are not resolved in the image produced by the objective cannot be\nresolved by any further magnification produced by the eyepiece. The\nprimary purpose of the eyepiece is to provide magnification of the image\nproduced by the objective.\n\nConsider a parallel beam of light falling on a convex lens. If the lens is\nwell corrected for aberrations, then geometrical optics tells us that the\nbeam will get focused to a point. However, because of diffraction, the\nbeam instead of getting focused to a point gets focused to a spot of finite\narea. In this case the effects due to diffraction can be taken into account\nby considering a plane wave incident on a circular aperture followed by\na convex lens (Fig. 10.19). The analysis of the corresponding diffraction\npattern is quite involved; however, in principle, it is similar to the analysis\ncarried out to obtain the single-slit diffraction pattern. Taking into account\nthe effects due to diffraction, the pattern on the focal plane would consist\nof a central bright region surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings\n(Fig. 10.19). A detailed analysis shows that the radius of the central bright\nregion is approximately given by\n\n0\n\n1.22 0.61\n2\n\nf f\nr\n\na a\n\nλ λ\n≈ = (10.24)\n\nFIGURE 10.19 A parallel beam of light is incident on a convex lens.\nBecause of diffraction effects, the beam gets focused to a\n\nspot of radius ≈ 0.61 λf/a .\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n373\n\nWave Optics\n\nwhere f  is the focal length of the lens and 2a is the diameter of the circular\naperture or the diameter of the lens, whichever is smaller. Typically if\n\nλ ≈  0.5 µm,  f ≈  20 cm  and  a ≈  5 cm\nwe have\n\nr\n0\n  ≈  1.2 µm\n\nAlthough the size of the spot is very small, it plays an important role\nin determining the limit of resolution of optical instruments like a telescope\nor a microscope.  For the two stars to be just resolved\n\n0\n\n0.61 f\nf r\n\na\n\nλ\nθ∆ ≈ ≈\n\nimplying\n\n0.61\na\n\nλ\nθ∆ ≈ (10.25)\n\nThus ∆θ will be small if the diameter of the objective is large. This\nimplies that the telescope will have better resolving power if a is large. It\nis for this reason that for better resolution, a telescope must have a large\ndiameter objective.\n\nExample 10.6 Assume that light of wavelength 6000Å is coming from\na star. What is the limit of resolution of a telescope whose objective\nhas a diameter of 100 inch?\n\nSolution A 100 inch telescope implies that 2a = 100 inch\n= 254 cm. Thus if,\n\nλ ≈ 6000Å = 6×10–5 cm\nthen\n\n–5\n–70.61 6 10 2.9 10\n\n127\nθ\n\n× ×\n∆ ≈ ≈ × radians\n\nWe can apply a similar argument to the objective lens of a microscope.\nIn this case, the object is placed slightly beyond f, so that a real image is\nformed at a distance v [Fig. 10.20]. The magnification (ratio of\nimage size to object size) is given by m l v/f. It can be seen from\nFig. 10.20 that\n\nD/f l 2 tan β (10.26)\nwhere 2β is the angle subtended by the diameter of the objective lens at\nthe focus of the microscope.\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n0\n.6\n\nFIGURE 10.20 Real image formed by the objective lens of the microscope.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n374\n\nWhen the separation between two points in a microscopic specimen\nis comparable to the wavelength λ of the light, the diffraction effects\nbecome important.

Make\nblack stripes of equal width separated by white stripes; see figure here. All the black\nstripes should be of equal width, while the width of the intermediate white stripes should\nincrease as you go from the left to the right. For example, let all black stripes have a width\nof 5 mm. Let the width of the first two white stripes be 0.5 mm each, the next two white\nstripes be 1 mm each, the next two 1.5 mm each, etc. Paste this pattern on a wall in a\nroom or laboratory, at the height of your eye.\n\nNow watch the pattern, preferably with one eye. By moving away or closer to the wall,\nfind the position where you can just see some two black stripes as separate stripes. All\nthe black stripes to the left of this stripe would merge into one another and would not be\ndistinguishable. On the other hand, the black stripes to the right of this would be more\nand more clearly visible. Note the width d of the white stripe which separates the two\nregions, and measure the distance D of the wall from your eye. Then d/D is the resolution\nof your eye.\n\nYou have watched specks of dust floating in air in a sunbeam entering through your\nwindow. Find the distance (of a speck) which you can clearly see and distinguish from a\nneighbouring speck. Knowing the resolution of your eye and the distance of the speck,\nestimate the size of the speck of dust.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n375\n\nWave Optics\n\n1.22\n2sin\n\nλ\nβ\n\n� (10.29)\n\nIf the medium between the object and the objective lens is not air but\na medium of refractive index n, Eq. (10.29)  gets  modified to\n\nmin\n\n1.22\n2 sin\n\nd\nn\n\nλ\nβ\n\n= (10.30)\n\nThe product n sinβ is called the numerical aperture and is sometimes\nmarked on the objective.\n\nThe resolving power of the microscope is given by the reciprocal of\nthe minimum separation of two points seen as distinct. It can be seen\nfrom Eq. (10.30) that the resolving power can be increased by choosing a\nmedium of higher refractive index. Usually an oil having a refractive index\nclose to that of the objective glass is used. Such an arrangement is called\nan ‘oil immersion objective’. Notice that it is not possible to make sinβ\nlarger than unity. Thus, we see that the resolving power of a microscope\nis basically determined by the wavelength of the light used.\n\nThere is a likelihood of confusion between resolution and\nmagnification, and similarly between the role of a telescope and a\nmicroscope to deal with these parameters. A telescope produces images\nof far objects nearer to our eye. Therefore objects which are not resolved\nat far distance, can be resolved by looking at them through a telescope.\nA microscope, on the other hand, magnifies objects (which are near to\nus) and produces their larger image. We may be looking at two stars or\ntwo satellites of a far-away planet, or we may be looking at different\nregions of a living cell. In this context, it is good to remember that a\ntelescope resolves whereas a microscope magnifies.\n\n10.6.4  The validity of ray optics\n\nAn aperture (i.e., slit or hole) of size a illuminated by a parallel beam\nsends diffracted light into an angle of approximately ≈ λ/a . This is the\nangular size of the bright central maximum. In travelling a distance z,\nthe diffracted beam therefore acquires a width zλ/a due to diffraction. It\nis interesting to ask at what value of z the spreading due to diffraction\nbecomes comparable to the size a of the aperture. We thus approximately\nequate zλ/a with a. This gives the distance beyond which divergence of\nthe beam of width a becomes significant. Therefore,\n\n2\na\n\nz\nλ\n\n� (10.31)\n\nWe define a quantity z\nF\n\n  called the Fresnel distance by the following\nequation\n\n2 /Fz a λ�\nEquation (10.31) shows that for distances much smaller than z\n\nF\n , the\n\nspreading due to diffraction is smaller compared to the size of the beam.\nIt becomes comparable when the distance is approximately  z\n\nF\n. For\n\ndistances much greater than z\nF\n, the spreading due to diffraction\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n376\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n0\n.7\n\ndominates over that due to ray optics (i.e., the size a of the aperture).\nEquation (10.31) also shows that ray optics is valid in the limit of\nwavelength tending to zero.\n\nExample 10.7 For what distance is ray optics a good approximation\nwhen the aperture is 3 mm wide and the wavelength is 500 nm?\n\nSolution  \n( )2–32\n\n–7\n\n3 10\n18 m\n\n5 10\nF\n\na\nz\n\nλ\n\n×\n= = =\n\n×\n\nThis example shows that even with a small aperture, diffraction\nspreading can be neglected for rays many metres in length. Thus, ray\noptics is valid in many common situations.\n\n10.7  POLARISATION\nConsider holding a long string that is held horizontally, the other end of\nwhich is assumed to be fixed. If we move the end of the string up and\ndown in a periodic manner, we will generate a wave propagating  in the\n+x direction (Fig. 10.21). Such a wave could be described by the following\nequation\n\nFIGURE 10.21 (a) The curves represent the displacement of a string at\nt = 0 and at t = ∆t, respectively when a sinusoidal wave is propagating\n\nin the +x-direction. (b) The curve represents the time variation\nof the displacement at x = 0 when a sinusoidal wave is propagating\n\nin the +x-direction. At  x = ∆x, the time variation of the\ndisplacement will be slightly displaced to the right.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n377\n\nWave Optics\n\ny (x,t ) = a sin (kx – ωt) (10.32)\n\nwhere a and ω (= 2πν ) represent the amplitude and the angular frequency\nof the wave, respectively; further,\n\n2\nk\n\nλ\nπ\n\n= (10.33)\n\nrepresents the wavelength associated with the wave. We had discussed\npropagation of such waves in Chapter 15 of Class XI textbook. Since the\ndisplacement (which is along the y direction) is at right angles to the\ndirection of propagation of the wave, we have what is known as a\ntransverse wave. Also, since the displacement is in the y direction, it is\noften referred to as a y-polarised wave. Since each point on the string\nmoves on a straight line, the wave is also referred to as a linearly polarised\nwave. Further, the string always remains confined to the x-y plane and\ntherefore it is also referred to as a plane polarised wave.\n\nIn a similar manner we can consider the vibration of the string in the\nx-z plane generating a z-polarised wave whose displacement will be given\nby\n\nz (x,t ) = a sin (kx – ωt ) (10.34)\n\nIt should be mentioned that the linearly polarised waves [described\nby Eqs. (10.32) and (10.34)] are all transverse waves; i.e., the\ndisplacement of each point of the string is always at right angles to the\ndirection of propagation of the wave. Finally, if the plane of vibration of\nthe string is changed randomly in very short intervals of time, then we\nhave what is known as an unpolarised wave. Thus, for an unpolarised\nwave the displacement will be randomly changing with time though it\nwill always be perpendicular to the direction of propagation.\n\nLight waves are transverse in nature; i.e., the electric field associated\nwith a propagating light wave is always at right angles to the direction of\npropagation of the wave. This can be easily demonstrated using a simple\npolaroid. You must have seen thin plastic like sheets, which are called\npolaroids. A polaroid consists of long chain molecules aligned in a\nparticular direction. The electric vectors (associated with the propagating\nlight wave) along the direction of the aligned molecules get absorbed.\nThus, if an unpolarised light wave is incident on such a polaroid then\nthe light wave will get linearly polarised with the electric vector oscillating\nalong a direction perpendicular to the aligned molecules; this direction\nis known as the pass-axis of the polaroid.\n\nThus, if the light from an ordinary source (like a sodium lamp) passes\nthrough a polaroid sheet P1, it is observed that its intensity is reduced by\nhalf. Rotating P\n\n1\n has no effect on the transmitted beam and transmitted\n\nintensity remains constant. Now, let an identical piece of polaroid P\n2\n be\n\nplaced before P1. As expected, the light from the lamp is reduced in\nintensity on passing through P\n\n2\n alone. But now rotating P\n\n1\n has a dramatic\n\neffect on the light coming from P\n2\n. In one position, the intensity transmitted\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n378  E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n0\n.8\n\nby P\n2\n followed by P\n\n1\n is nearly zero. When turned by 90° from this position,\n\nP\n1\n transmits nearly the full intensity emerging from P\n\n2\n (Fig. 10.22).\n\nThe above experiment can be easily understood by assuming that\nlight passing through the polaroid P2 gets polarised along  the pass-axis\nof  P\n\n2\n. If the pass-axis of  P\n\n2 \nmakes an angle θ with the pass-axis of  P\n\n1\n,\n\nthen  when the polarised beam passes through the polaroid P\n2\n, the\n\ncomponent  E cos θ  (along the pass-axis of P2) will pass through P2.\nThus, as we rotate the polaroid P\n\n1 \n(or P\n\n2\n), the intensity will vary as:\n\nI = I0 cos\n2θ (10.35)\n\nwhere I0 is the intensity of the polarized light after passing through\nP\n\n1\n.\n \nThis is known as Malus’ law. The above discussion shows that the\n\nintensity coming out of a single polaroid is half of the incident intensity.\nBy putting a second polaroid, the intensity can be further controlled\nfrom 50% to zero of the incident intensity by adjusting the angle between\nthe pass-axes of two polaroids.\n\nPolaroids can be used to control the intensity, in sunglasses,\nwindowpanes, etc. Polaroids are also used in photographic cameras and\n3D movie cameras.\n\nExample 10.8 Discuss the intensity of transmitted light when a\npolaroid sheet is rotated between two crossed polaroids?\n\nSolution Let I0 be the intensity of polarised light after passing through\nthe first polariser P1. Then the intensity of light after passing through\nsecond polariser P2 will be\n\n2\n0cosI I θ= ,\n\nFIGURE 10.22 (a) Passage of light through two polaroids P\n2\n and P\n\n1\n. The\n\ntransmitted fraction falls from 1 to 0 as the angle between them varies\nfrom  0° to 90°. Notice that the light seen through a single polaroid\n\nP\n1 does not vary with angle. (b) Behaviour of the electric vector\nwhen light passes through two polaroids. The transmitted\npolarisation is the component parallel to the polaroid axis.\n\nThe double arrows show the oscillations of the electric vector.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n379\n\nWave Optics\n\nwhere θ is the angle between pass axes of P1 and P2. Since P1 and P3\nare crossed the angle between the pass axes of P2 and P3 will be\n(π/2–θ ). Hence the intensity of light emerging from P3 will be\n\n2 2\n0cos cos –2\n\nI I θ θ\nπ\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\n= \uf8ec \uf8f7\uf8ed \uf8f8\n\n  = I0 cos\n2θ  sin2θ =(I0/4) sin\n\n22θ\n\nTherefore, the transmitted intensity will be maximum when θ = π/4.\n\n10.7.1  Polarisation by scattering\n\nThe light from a clear blue portion of the sky shows a rise and fall of\nintensity when viewed through a polaroid which is rotated. This is nothing\nbut sunlight, which has changed its direction (having been scattered) on\nencountering the molecules of the earth’s atmosphere. As Fig. 10.23(a)\nshows, the incident sunlight is unpolarised. The dots stand for polarisation\nperpendicular to the plane of the figure. The double arrows show\npolarisation in the plane of the figure. (There is no phase relation between\nthese two in unpolarised light). Under the influence of the electric field of\nthe incident wave the electrons in the molecules acquire components of\nmotion in both these directions. We have drawn an observer looking at\n90° to the direction of the sun. Clearly, charges accelerating parallel to\nthe double arrows do not radiate energy towards this observer since their\nacceleration has no transverse component. The radiation scattered by\nthe molecule is therefore represented by dots. It is polarised\nperpendicular to the plane of the figure. This explains the polarisation of\nscattered light from the sky.\n\nFIGURE 10.23 (a) Polarisation of the blue scattered light from the sky.\nThe incident sunlight is unpolarised (dots and arrows). A typical\n\nmolecule is shown. It scatters light by 90° polarised normal to\nthe plane of the paper (dots only). (b) Polarisation of light\n\nreflected from a transparent medium at the Brewster angle\n(reflected ray perpendicular to refracted ray).\n\nThe scattering of light by molecules was intensively investigated by\nC.V. Raman and his collaborators in Kolkata in the 1920s. Raman was\nawarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1930 for this work.\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n0\n.8\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n380\n\nA SPECIAL CASE OF TOTAL TRANSMISSION\n\nWhen light is incident on an interface of two media, it is observed that some part of it\ngets reflected and some part gets transmitted. Consider a related question: Is it possible\nthat under some conditions a monochromatic beam of light incident on a surface\n\n(which is normally reflective) gets completely transmitted with no reflection? To your\nsurprise, the answer is yes.\n\nLet us try a simple experiment and check what happens. Arrange a laser, a good\npolariser, a prism and screen as shown in the figure here.\n\nLet the light emitted by the laser source pass through the polariser and be incident\non the surface of the prism at the Brewster’s  angle of incidence i\n\nB\n. Now rotate the\n\npolariser carefully and you will observe that for a specific alignment of the polariser, the\nlight incident on the prism is completely transmitted and no light is reflected from the\nsurface of the prism. The reflected spot will completely vanish.\n\n10.7.2  Polarisation by reflection\n\nFigure 10.23(b) shows light reflected from a transparent medium, say,\nwater. As before, the dots and arrows indicate that both polarisations are\npresent in the incident and refracted waves. We have drawn a situation\nin which the reflected wave travels at right angles to the refracted wave.\nThe oscillating electrons in the water produce the reflected wave. These\nmove in the two directions transverse to the radiation from wave in the\nmedium, i.e., the refracted wave. The arrows are parallel to the direction\nof the reflected wave. Motion in this direction does not contribute to the\nreflected wave. As the figure shows, the reflected light is therefore linearly\npolarised perpendicular to the plane of the figure (represented by dots).\nThis can be checked by looking at the reflected light through an analyser.\nThe transmitted intensity will be zero when the axis of the analyser is in\nthe plane of the figure, i.e., the plane of incidence.\n\nWhen unpolarised light is incident on the boundary between two\ntransparent media, the reflected light is polarised with its electric vector\nperpendicular to the plane of incidence when the  refracted and reflected\nrays make a right angle with each other. Thus we have seen that when\nreflected wave is perpendicular to the refracted wave, the reflected wave\nis a totally polarised wave. The angle of incidence in this case is called\nBrewster’s angle and is denoted by iB. We can see that iB is related to the\nrefractive index of the denser medium. Since we have iB+r = π/2, we get\nfrom Snell’s law\n\n( )\nsin sin\nsin sin /2 –\n\nB B\n\nB\n\ni i\n\nr i\nµ = =\n\nπ\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n381\n\nWave Optics\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n0\n.9\n\nsin\ntan\n\ncos\nB\n\nB\n\nB\n\ni\ni\n\ni\n= = (10.36)\n\nThis is known as Brewster’s law.\n\nExample 10.9 Unpolarised light is incident on a plane glass surface.\nWhat should be the angle of incidence so that the reflected and\nrefracted rays are perpendicular to each other?\n\nSolution For i + r to be equal to π/2, we should have tan i\nB\n = µ = 1.5.\n\nThis gives iB = 57°. This is the Brewster’s angle for air to glass\ninterface.\n\nFor simplicity, we have discussed scattering of light by 90°, and\nreflection at the Brewster angle. In this special situation, one of the two\nperpendicular components of the electric field is zero. At other angles,\nboth components are present but one is stronger than the other. There is\nno stable phase relationship between the two perpendicular components\nsince these are derived from two perpendicular components of an\nunpolarised beam. When such light is viewed through a rotating analyser,\none sees a maximum and a minimum of intensity but not complete\ndarkness. This kind of light is called partially polarised.\n\nLet us try to understand the situation. When an unpolarised beam of\nlight is incident at the Brewster’s angle on an interface of two media, only\npart of light with electric field vector perpendicular to the plane of\nincidence will be reflected. Now by using a good polariser, if we completely\nremove all the light with its electric vector perpendicular to the plane of\nincidence and let this light be incident on the surface of the prism at\nBrewster’s angle, you will then observe no reflection and there will be\ntotal transmission of light.\n\nWe began this chapter by pointing out that there are some phenomena\nwhich can be explained only by the wave theory. In order to develop a\nproper understanding, we first described how some phenomena like\nreflection and refraction, which were studied on this basis of Ray Optics\nin Chapter 9, can also be understood on the basis of Wave Optics. Then\nwe described Young’s double slit experiment which was a turning point\nin the study of optics. Finally, we described some associated points such\nas diffraction, resolution, polarisation, and validity of ray optics. In the\nnext chapter, you will see how new experiments led to new theories at\nthe turn of the century around 1900 A.D.\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. Huygens’ principle tells us that each point on a wavefront is a source\nof secondary waves, which add up to give the wavefront at a later time.\n\n2. Huygens’ construction tells us that the new wavefront is the forward\nenvelope of the secondary waves. When the speed of light is\nindependent of direction, the secondary waves are spherical. The rays\nare then perpendicular to both the wavefronts and the time of travel\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n382\n\nis the same measured along any ray. This principle leads to the well\nknown laws of reflection and refraction.\n\n3. The principle of superposition of waves applies whenever two or more\nsources of light illuminate the same point. When we consider the\nintensity of light due to these sources at the given point, there is an\ninterference term in addition to the sum of the individual intensities.\nBut this term is important only if it has a non-zero average, which\noccurs only if the sources have the same frequency and a stable\nphase difference.\n\n4. Young’s double slit of separation d gives equally spaced fringes of\nangular separation λ/d. The source, mid-point of the slits, and central\nbright fringe lie in a straight line. An extended source will destroy\nthe fringes if it subtends angle more than λ/d at the slits.\n\n5. A single slit of width a gives a diffraction pattern with a central\n\nmaximum. The intensity falls to zero at angles of \n2\n\n, ,\na a\n\nλ λ\n± ±  etc.,\n\nwith successively weaker secondary maxima in between. Diffraction\nlimits the angular resolution of a telescope to λ/D where D is the\ndiameter. Two stars closer than this give strongly overlapping images.\nSimilarly, a microscope objective subtending angle 2β  at the focus,\nin a medium of refractive index n, will just separate two objects spaced\nat a distance λ/(2n sin β), which is the resolution limit of a\nmicroscope. Diffraction determines the limitations of the concept of\nlight rays. A beam of width a travels a distance a2/λ, called the Fresnel\ndistance, before it starts to spread out due to diffraction.\n\n6. Natural light, e.g., from the sun is unpolarised. This means the electric\nvector takes all possible directions in the transverse plane, rapidly\nand randomly, during a measurement. A polaroid transmits only one\ncomponent (parallel to a special axis). The resulting light is called\nlinearly polarised or plane polarised. When this kind of light is viewed\nthrough a second polaroid  whose axis turns through 2π, two maxima\nand minima of intensity are seen. Polarised light can also be produced\nby reflection at a special angle (called the Brewster angle) and by\nscattering through π/2 in the earth’s atmosphere.\n\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n\n1. Waves from a point source spread out in all directions, while light was\nseen to travel along  narrow  rays. It required the insight and experiment\nof Huygens, Young and Fresnel to understand how a wave theory could\nexplain all aspects of the behaviour of light.\n\n2. The crucial new feature of waves is interference of amplitudes from different\nsources which can be both constructive and destructive, as shown in\nYoung’s experiment.\n\n3. Diffraction phenomena define the limits of ray optics. The limit of the\nability of microscopes and telescopes to distinguish very close objects is\nset by the wavelength of light.\n\n4. Most interference and diffraction effects exist even for longitudinal waves\nlike sound in air. But polarisation phenomena are special to transverse\nwaves like light waves.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n383\n\nWave Optics\n\nEXERCISES\n\n10.1 Monochromatic light of wavelength 589 nm is incident from air on a\nwater surface.

Towards the same period at the end\nof 19th century, experimental investigations on conduction of electricity\n(electric discharge) through gases at low pressure in a discharge tube led\nto many historic discoveries. The discovery of X-rays by Roentgen in 1895,\nand of electron by J. J. Thomson in 1897, were important milestones in\nthe understanding of atomic structure. It was found that at sufficiently\nlow pressure of about 0.001 mm of mercury column, a discharge took\nplace between the two electrodes on applying the electric field to the gas\nin the discharge tube. A fluorescent glow appeared on the glass opposite\nto cathode. The colour of glow of the glass depended on the type of glass,\nit  being  yellowish-green for soda glass. The cause of this fluorescence\nwas attributed to the radiation which appeared to be coming from the\ncathode. These cathode rays were discovered, in 1870, by William\nCrookes who later, in 1879, suggested that these rays consisted of streams\nof fast moving negatively charged particles. The British physicist\nJ. J. Thomson (1856-1940) confirmed this hypothesis. By applying\nmutually perpendicular electric and magnetic fields across the discharge\ntube, J. J. Thomson was the first to determine experimentally the speed\nand the specific charge [charge to mass ratio (e/m )] of the cathode ray\n\nChapter Eleven\n\nDUAL NATURE OF\n\nRADIATION AND\n\nMATTER\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n387\n\nDual Nature of Radiation\n\nand Matter\n\nparticles. They were found to travel with speeds ranging from about 0.1\nto 0.2 times the speed of light (3 ×108 m/s). The presently accepted value\nof e/m is 1.76 × 1011 C/kg. Further, the value of e/m was found to be\nindependent of the nature of the material/metal used as the cathode\n(emitter), or the gas introduced in the discharge tube. This observation\nsuggested the universality of the cathode ray particles.\n\nAround the same time, in 1887, it was found that certain metals, when\nirradiated by ultraviolet light, emitted negatively charged particles having\nsmall speeds. Also, certain metals when heated to a high temperature were\nfound to emit negatively charged particles. The value of e/m of these particles\nwas found to be the same as that for cathode ray particles. These\nobservations thus established that all these particles, although produced\nunder different conditions, were identical in nature. J. J. Thomson, in 1897,\nnamed these particles as electrons, and suggested that they were\nfundamental, universal  constituents of matter. For his epoch-making\ndiscovery of electron, through his theoretical and experimental\ninvestigations on conduction of electricity by gasses, he was awarded the\nNobel Prize in Physics in 1906. In 1913, the American physicist R. A.\nMillikan (1868-1953) performed the pioneering oil-drop experiment for\nthe precise measurement of the charge on an electron. He found that  the\ncharge on an oil-droplet was always an integral multiple of an elementary\ncharge, 1.602 × 10–19 C. Millikan’s experiment established that electric\ncharge is quantised. From the values of charge (e ) and specific charge\n(e/m ), the mass (m) of the electron could be determined.\n\n11.2  ELECTRON EMISSION\nWe know that metals have free electrons (negatively charged particles) that\nare responsible for their conductivity. However, the free electrons cannot\nnormally escape out of the metal surface. If an electron attempts to come\nout of the metal, the metal surface acquires a positive charge  and pulls the\nelectron back to  the metal. The free electron is thus held inside the metal\nsurface by the attractive forces of the ions. Consequently, the electron can\ncome out of the metal surface only if it has got sufficient energy to overcome\nthe attractive pull. A certain minimum amount of energy is required to be\ngiven  to an electron to pull it out from the surface of the metal. This\nminimum energy required by an electron to escape from the metal surface\nis called the work function of the metal. It is generally denoted by φ0 and\nmeasured in eV (electron volt). One electron volt is the energy gained by an\nelectron when it has been accelerated by  a  potential difference  of 1 volt, so\nthat  1 eV = 1.602 ×10–19 J.\n\nThis unit of energy is commonly used in atomic and nuclear physics.\nThe work function (φ0)  depends on the properties of the metal and the\nnature of its surface. The values of work function of some metals are\ngiven in Table 11.1. These values are approximate as they are very\nsensitive to surface impurities.\n\nNote from Table 11.1 that the work function of platinum is the highest\n(φ0 = 5.65 eV) while it is the lowest (φ0 = 2.14 eV) for caesium.\n\nThe minimum energy required for the electron emission from the metal\nsurface can be supplied to the free electrons by any one of the following\nphysical processes:\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n388\n\n(i) Thermionic emission: By suitably heating, sufficient thermal energy\ncan be imparted to the free electrons to enable them to come out of the\nmetal.\n\n(ii) Field emission : By applying a very strong electric field (of the order of\n108 V m–1) to a metal, electrons can be pulled out of the metal, as in a\nspark plug.\n\n(iii) Photoelectric emission : When light of suitable frequency illuminates\na metal surface, electrons are emitted from the metal surface. These\nphoto(light)-generated electrons are called photoelectrons.\n\n11.3  PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT\n\n11.3.1  Hertz’s observations\n\nThe phenomenon of photoelectric emission was discovered in 1887 by\nHeinrich Hertz (1857-1894), during his electromagnetic wave experiments.\nIn his experimental investigation on the production of electromagnetic\nwaves by means of a spark discharge, Hertz observed that high voltage\nsparks across the detector loop were enhanced when the emitter plate\nwas illuminated by ultraviolet light from an arc lamp.\n\nLight shining on the metal surface somehow facilitated the escape of\nfree, charged particles which we now know as electrons. When light falls\non a metal surface, some electrons near the surface absorb enough energy\nfrom the incident radiation to overcome the attraction of the positive ions\nin the material of the surface. After gaining sufficient energy from the\nincident light, the electrons escape from the surface of the metal into the\nsurrounding space.\n\n11.3.2  Hallwachs’ and Lenard’s observations\n\nWilhelm Hallwachs and Philipp Lenard investigated the phenomenon of\nphotoelectric emission in detail during 1886-1902.\n\nLenard (1862-1947) observed that when ultraviolet radiations were\nallowed to fall on the emitter plate of an evacuated glass tube enclosing\ntwo electrodes (metal plates), current flows in the circuit (Fig. 11.1). As\nsoon as the ultraviolet radiations were stopped, the current flow also\n\nTABLE 11.1 WORK FUNCTIONS OF SOME METALS\n\nMetal Work function Metal Work function\n\nφφφφφ\nοοοοο\n (eV) φφφφφ\n\nοοοοο\n (eV)\n\nCs 2.14 Al 4.28\n\nK 2.30 Hg 4.49\n\nNa 2.75 Cu 4.65\n\nCa 3.20 Ag 4.70\n\nMo 4.17 Ni 5.15\n\nPb 4.25 Pt 5.65\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n389\n\nDual Nature of Radiation\n\nand Matter\n\nstopped. These observations indicate that when ultraviolet radiations fall\non the emitter plate C, electrons are ejected from it which are attracted\ntowards the positive, collector plate A by the electric field. The electrons\nflow through the evacuated glass tube, resulting in the current flow. Thus,\nlight falling on the surface of the emitter causes current in the external\ncircuit. Hallwachs and Lenard studied how this photo current varied with\ncollector plate potential, and with frequency and intensity of incident light.\n\nHallwachs, in 1888, undertook the study further and connected a\nnegatively charged zinc plate to an electroscope. He observed that the\nzinc plate lost its charge when it was illuminated by ultraviolet light.\nFurther, the uncharged zinc plate became positively charged when it was\nirradiated by ultraviolet light. Positive charge on a  positively charged\nzinc plate was found to be further enhanced when it was illuminated by\nultraviolet light. From these observations he concluded that negatively\ncharged particles were emitted from the zinc plate under the action of\nultraviolet light.\n\nAfter the discovery of the electron in 1897, it became evident that the\nincident light causes electrons to be emitted from the emitter plate. Due\nto negative charge, the emitted electrons are pushed towards the collector\nplate by the electric field. Hallwachs and  Lenard also observed that when\nultraviolet light fell on the emitter plate, no electrons were emitted at all\nwhen the frequency of the incident light was smaller than a certain\nminimum value, called the threshold frequency. This minimum frequency\ndepends on the nature of the material of the emitter plate.\n\nIt was found that certain metals like zinc, cadmium, magnesium, etc.,\nresponded only to ultraviolet light, having short wavelength, to cause\nelectron emission from the surface. However, some alkali metals such as\nlithium, sodium, potassium, caesium and rubidium were sensitive\neven to visible light. All these photosensitive substances emit electrons\nwhen they are illuminated by light. After the discovery of electrons, these\nelectrons were termed as photoelectrons. The phenomenon is called\nphotoelectric effect.\n\n11.4 EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF PHOTOELECTRIC\nEFFECT\n\nFigure 11.1 depicts a  schematic view of the arrangement used for the\nexperimental study of the photoelectric effect. It consists of an evacuated\nglass/quartz tube having a thin photosensitive plate C and another metal\nplate A. Monochromatic light from the source S of sufficiently short\nwavelength passes through the window W and falls on the photosensitive\nplate C  (emitter). A transparent quartz window is sealed on to the glass\ntube, which permits ultraviolet radiation to pass through it and irradiate\nthe photosensitive plate C. The electrons are emitted by the plate C and\nare collected by the plate A (collector), by the electric field created by the\nbattery. The battery maintains the potential difference between the plates\nC and A, that can be varied. The polarity of the plates C and A can be\nreversed by a commutator. Thus, the plate A can be maintained at a desired\npositive or negative potential with respect to emitter C. When the collector\nplate A is positive with respect to the emitter plate C, the electrons are\n\nS\nim\n\nu\nla\n\nte\n e\n\nx\np\n\ne\nrim\n\ne\nn\n\nts\n o\n\nn\n p\n\nh\no\n\nto\ne\nle\n\nc\ntric\n\n e\nffe\n\nc\nt\n\nh\nttp\n\n://w\nw\n\nw\n.k\n\nc\nv\ns.c\n\na\n/site\n\n/p\nro\n\nje\nc\nts/p\n\nh\ny\nsic\n\ns.h\ntm\n\nl\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n390\n\nattracted to it. The emission of electrons causes flow of\nelectric current in the circuit. The potential difference\nbetween the emitter and collector plates is measured by\na voltmeter (V) whereas the resulting photo current\nflowing in the circuit is measured by a microammeter\n(µA). The photoelectric current can be increased or\ndecreased by varying the potential of collector plate A\nwith respect to the emitter plate C. The intensity and\nfrequency of the incident light can be varied, as can the\npotential difference V between the emitter C and the\ncollector A.\n\nWe can use the experimental arrangement of\nFig. 11.1 to study the variation of photocurrent with\n(a) intensity of radiation, (b) frequency of incident\nradiation, (c) the potential difference between the\nplates A and C, and (d) the nature of the material\nof plate C. Light of  different frequencies can be used\nby putting appropriate coloured filter or coloured\n\nglass in the path of light falling on the emitter C. The intensity\nof light is varied by changing the distance of the light source\nfrom the emitter.\n\n11.4.1  Effect of intensity of light on photocurrent\n\nThe collector A is maintained at a positive potential with\nrespect to emitter C so that electrons ejected from C are\nattracted towards collector A. Keeping the frequency of the\nincident radiation and the potential fixed, the intensity of light\nis varied and the resulting photoelectric current is measured\neach time. It is found that the photocurrent increases linearly\nwith intensity of incident light as shown graphically in\nFig. 11.2. The photocurrent is directly  proportional to the\nnumber of photoelectrons emitted per second. This implies\nthat the number of photoelectrons emitted per second is\ndirectly proportional to the intensity of incident radiation.\n\n11.4.2  Effect of potential on photoelectric current\n\nWe first keep the plate A at some positive potential with respect to the\nplate C and illuminate the plate C with light of fixed frequency ν  and fixed\nintensity I1. We next vary the positive potential of plate A gradually and\nmeasure the resulting photocurrent each time. It is found that the\nphotoelectric current increases with increase in positive (accelerating)\npotential. At some stage, for a certain positive potential of plate A, all the\nemitted electrons are  collected by the plate A and the photoelectric current\nbecomes maximum or  saturates. If we increase the accelerating potential\nof plate A further, the photocurrent does not increase. This maximum\nvalue of the photoelectric current is called  saturation current. Saturation\ncurrent corresponds to the case when all the photoelectrons emitted by\nthe emitter plate C reach the collector plate A.\n\nWe now apply a negative (retarding) potential to the plate A with respect\nto the plate C and make it increasingly negative gradually. When the\n\nFIGURE 11.1 Experimental\narrangement for  study of\n\nphotoelectric effect.\n\nFIGURE 11.2 Variation of\nPhotoelectric current with\n\nintensity of light.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n391\n\nDual Nature of Radiation\n\nand Matter\n\npolarity is reversed, the electrons are\nrepelled and only the sufficiently energetic\nelectrons are able to reach the collector A.\nThe photocurrent is found to decrease\nrapidly until it drops to zero at a certain\nsharply defined, critical value of the negative\npotential V0 on the plate A. For a particular\nfrequency of incident radiation, the\nminimum negative (retarding) potential V0\ngiven to the plate A for which the\n\nphotocurrent stops or becomes zero is\n\ncalled the cut-off or stopping potential.\nThe interpretation of the observation in\n\nterms of photoelectrons is straightforward.\nAll the photoelectrons emitted from the\nmetal do not have the same energy.\nPhotoelectric current is zero when the\nstopping potential is sufficient to repel even\nthe most energetic photoelectrons, with the\nmaximum kinetic energy (Kmax), so that\n\nKmax = e V0 (11.1)\n\nWe can now repeat this experiment with incident radiation of the same\nfrequency but of higher intensity I2 and I3 (I3 > I2 > I1). We note that the\nsaturation currents are now found to be at higher values. This shows\nthat more electrons are being emitted per second, proportional to the\nintensity of incident radiation. But the stopping potential remains the\nsame as that for the incident radiation of intensity I1, as shown graphically\nin Fig. 11.3. Thus, for a given frequency of the incident radiation, the\nstopping potential is independent of its intensity. In other words, the\nmaximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons depends on the light source\nand the emitter plate material, but is independent of intensity of incident\nradiation.\n\n11.4.3 Effect of frequency of incident radiation on stopping\npotential\n\nWe now study the relation between the\nfrequency ν of the incident radiation and the\nstopping potential V0. We suitably adjust the\nsame intensity of light radiation at various\nfrequencies and study the variation of\nphotocurrent with collector plate potential. The\nresulting variation is shown in Fig. 11.4. We\nobtain different values of stopping potential but\nthe same value of the saturation current for\nincident radiation of different frequencies. The\nenergy of the emitted electrons depends on the\nfrequency of the incident radiations. The\nstopping potential is more negative for higher\nfrequencies of incident radiation. Note from\n\nFIGURE 11.3 Variation of  photocurrent with\ncollector plate potential for different\n\nintensity of incident radiation.\n\nFIGURE 11.4 Variation of photoelectric current\nwith collector plate potential for different\n\nfrequencies of incident radiation.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n392\n\nFig. 11.4  that the stopping potentials are in the\norder V03 > V02 > V01 if the frequencies are in the\norder ν3 > ν2 > ν1 . This implies that greater the\nfrequency of incident light, greater is the\nmaximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons.\nConsequently, we need greater retarding\npotential to stop them completely. If we plot a\ngraph between the frequency of incident radiation\nand the corresponding stopping potential for\ndifferent metals we get a straight line, as shown\nin Fig. 11.5.\n\nThe graph shows that\n(i) the stopping potential V0 varies linearly with\n\nthe frequency of incident radiation for a given\nphotosensitive material.\n\n(ii) there exists a certain minimum cut-off frequency ν0 for which the\nstopping potential is zero.\n\nThese observations have two implications:\n(i) The maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons varies linearly\n\nwith the frequency of incident radiation, but is independent of its\n\nintensity.\n\n(ii) For a frequency ν of incident radiation, lower than the cut-off\nfrequency ν0, no photoelectric emission is possible even if the\nintensity is large.\n\nThis minimum, cut-off frequency ν0, is called the threshold frequency.\nIt is different for different metals.\n\nDifferent photosensitive materials respond differently to light. Selenium\nis more sensitive than zinc or copper. The same photosensitive substance\ngives different response to light of different wavelengths. For example,\nultraviolet light gives rise to  photoelectric effect in copper  while green or\nred light does not.\n\nNote that in all the above experiments, it is found that, if frequency of\nthe incident radiation exceeds the threshold frequency, the photoelectric\nemission starts instantaneously without any apparent time lag, even if\nthe incident radiation is very dim. It is now known that emission starts in\na time of the order of 10– 9 s or less.\n\nWe now summarise the experimental features and observations\ndescribed in this section.\n(i) For a given photosensitive material and frequency of incident radiation\n\n(above the threshold frequency), the photoelectric current is directly\nproportional to the intensity of incident light (Fig. 11.2).\n\n(ii) For a given photosensitive material and frequency of incident radiation,\nsaturation current is found to be proportional to the intensity of\nincident radiation whereas the stopping potential is independent of\nits intensity (Fig. 11.3).\n\n(iii) For a given photosensitive material, there exists a certain minimum\ncut-off frequency of the incident radiation, called the threshold\nfrequency, below which no emission of photoelectrons takes place,\nno matter how intense the incident light is. Above the threshold\nfrequency, the stopping potential or equivalently the maximum kinetic\n\nFIGURE 11.5 Variation of stopping potential V\n0\n\nwith frequency ν of incident radiation for a\ngiven photosensitive material.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n393\n\nDual Nature of Radiation\n\nand Matter\n\nenergy of the emitted photoelectrons increases linearly with the\nfrequency of the incident radiation, but is independent of its intensity\n(Fig. 11.5).\n\n(iv) The photoelectric emission is an instantaneous process without any\napparent time lag (∼10– 9s or less), even when the incident radiation is\nmade exceedingly dim.\n\n11.5 PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT AND WAVE THEORY\nOF LIGHT\n\nThe wave nature of light was well established by the end of the nineteenth\ncentury. The phenomena of interference, diffraction and polarisation were\nexplained in a natural and satisfactory way by the wave picture of light.\nAccording to this picture, light is an electromagnetic wave consisting  of\nelectric and magnetic fields with continuous distribution of energy over\nthe region of space over which the wave is extended. Let us now see if this\nwave picture of light can explain the observations on photoelectric\nemission given in the previous section.\n\nAccording to the wave picture of light, the free electrons at the surface\nof the metal (over which the beam of radiation falls) absorb the radiant\nenergy continuously. The greater the intensity of radiation, the greater are\nthe amplitude of electric and magnetic fields. Consequently, the greater\nthe intensity, the greater should be the energy absorbed by each electron.\nIn this picture, the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons on the\nsurface is then expected to increase with increase in intensity. Also, no\nmatter what the frequency of radiation is, a sufficiently intense beam of\nradiation (over sufficient time) should be able to impart enough energy to\nthe electrons, so that they exceed the minimum energy needed to escape\nfrom the metal surface . A threshold frequency, therefore, should not exist.\nThese expectations of the wave theory directly contradict observations (i),\n(ii) and (iii) given at the end of sub-section 11.4.3.\n\nFurther, we should note that in the wave picture, the absorption of\nenergy by electron takes place continuously over the entire\nwavefront of the radiation. Since a large number of electrons absorb energy,\nthe energy absorbed per electron per unit time turns out to be small.\nExplicit calculations estimate that it can take hours or more for a single\nelectron to pick up sufficient energy to overcome the work function and\ncome out of the metal. This conclusion is again in striking contrast to\nobservation (iv) that the photoelectric emission is instantaneous. In short,\nthe wave picture is unable to explain the most basic features of\nphotoelectric  emission.\n\n11.6 EINSTEIN’S PHOTOELECTRIC EQUATION: ENERGY\nQUANTUM OF RADIATION\n\nIn 1905, Albert Einstein (1879-1955) proposed a radically new picture\nof electromagnetic radiation to explain photoelectric effect. In this picture,\nphotoelectric emission does not take place by continuous absorption of\nenergy from radiation. Radiation energy is built up of discrete units – the\nso called quanta of energy of radiation. Each quantum of radiant energy\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n394\n\nhas energy hν, where h is Planck’s constant and ν the\nfrequency of light. In photoelectric effect, an electron\nabsorbs a quantum of energy (hν ) of radiation. If this\nquantum of energy absorbed exceeds the minimum\nenergy needed for the electron to escape from the metal\nsurface (work function φ0), the electron is emitted with\nmaximum kinetic energy\n\nKmax = hν – φ0 (11.2)\n\nMore tightly bound electrons will emerge with kinetic\nenergies less than the maximum value. Note that the\nintensity of light of a given frequency is determined by\nthe number of photons incident per second. Increasing\nthe intensity will increase the number of emitted electrons\nper second. However, the maximum kinetic energy of the\nemitted photoelectrons is determined by the energy of each\nphoton.\n\nEquation (11.2) is known as Einstein’s photoelectric\nequation. We now see how this equation accounts in a\nsimple and elegant manner all the observations on\nphotoelectric effect given at the end of  sub-section 11.4.3.\n• According to Eq. (11.2), Kmax depends linearly on ν,\n\nand is independent of intensity of radiation, in\nagreement with observation. This has happened\nbecause in Einstein’s picture, photoelectric effect arises\nfrom the absorption of a single quantum of radiation\nby a single electron. The intensity of radiation (that is\nproportional to the number of energy quanta per unit\narea per unit time) is irrelevant to this basic process.\n\n• Since Kmax must be non-negative, Eq. (11.2 ) implies\nthat photoelectric emission is possible only if\nh ν > φ0\nor ν > ν0 , where\n\nν0 = \n0\n\nh\n\nφ\n(11.3)\n\nEquation (11.3) shows that the greater the work\nfunction φ0, the higher the minimum or threshold\nfrequency ν0 needed to emit photoelectrons. Thus,\nthere exists a threshold frequency ν0 (= φ0/h) for the\nmetal surface, below which no photoelectric  emission\nis possible, no matter how intense the incident\nradiation may be or how long it falls on the surface.\n\n• In this picture, intensity of radiation as noted above,\nis proportional to the number of energy quanta per\nunit area per unit time. The greater the number of\nenergy quanta available, the greater is the number of\nelectrons absorbing the energy quanta  and greater,\ntherefore, is the number of electrons coming out of\nthe metal (for ν > ν0). This explains why, for ν > ν0 ,\nphotoelectric current is proportional to intensity.\n\nA\nL\nB\n\nE\nR\n\nT\n E\n\nIN\nS\n\nT\nE\n\nIN\n (\n\n1\n8\n\n7\n9\n –\n\n 1\n9\n5\n5\n)\n\nAlbert Einstein (1879 –\n1955) Einstein, one of the\ngreatest physicists of all\ntime, was born in Ulm,\nGermany. In 1905, he\npublished three path-\nbreaking papers.  In the\nfirst paper, he introduced\nthe notion of light quanta\n(now called photons) and\nused it to explain the\nfeatures of photoelectric\neffect.  In the second paper,\nhe developed a theory of\nBrownian motion,\nconfirmed experimentally a\nfew years later and provided\na convincing evidence of\nthe atomic picture of matter.\nThe third paper gave birth\nto the special theory of\nrelativity. In 1916, he\npublished the general\ntheory of relativity. Some of\nEinstein’s most significant\nlater contributions are: the\nnotion of stimulated\nemission introduced in an\nalternative derivation of\nPlanck’s blackbody\nradiation law, static model\nof the universe which\nstarted modern cosmology,\nquantum statistics of a gas\nof massive bosons, and a\ncritical analysis of the\nfoundations of quantum\nmechanics. In 1921, he was\nawarded the Nobel Prize in\nphysics for his contribution\nto theoretical physics and\nthe photoelectric effect.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n395\n\nDual Nature of Radiation\n\nand Matter\n\n• In Einstein’s picture, the basic elementary process involved in\nphotoelectric effect is the absorption of a light quantum by an electron.\nThis process is instantaneous. Thus, whatever may be the intensity\ni.e., the number of quanta of radiation per unit area per unit time,\nphotoelectric emission is instantaneous. Low intensity does not mean\ndelay in emission, since the basic elementary process is the same.\nIntensity only determines how many electrons are able to participate\nin the elementary process (absorption of a light quantum by a single\nelectron) and, therefore, the photoelectric current.\n\nUsing Eq. (11.1), the photoelectric equation, Eq. (11.2), can be\nwritten as\n\ne V0 = h ν  – φ 0;  for 0ν ν≥\n\nor  V0 = \n0h\n\ne e\n\nφ\nν\n\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n−\uf8ec \uf8f7\uf8ed \uf8f8\n\n(11.4)\n\nThis is an important result. It predicts that the V0 versus ν  curve is a\nstraight line with slope = (h/e), independent of the nature of the material.\nDuring 1906-1916, Millikan performed a series of experiments on\nphotoelectric effect, aimed at disproving Einstein’s photoelectric equation.\nHe measured the slope of the straight line obtained for sodium, similar to\nthat shown in Fig. 11.5. Using the known value of e, he determined the\nvalue of Planck’s constant h. This value was close to the value of Planck’s\ncontant (= 6.626 × 10–34J s) determined in an entirely different context.\nIn this way, in 1916, Millikan proved the validity of Einstein’s photoelectric\nequation, instead of disproving it.\n\nThe successful explanation of photoelectric effect using the hypothesis\nof light quanta and the experimental determination of values of h and φ0,\nin agreement with values obtained from other experiments, led to the\nacceptance of Einstein’s picture of photoelectric effect. Millikan verified\nphotoelectric equation with great precision, for a number of alkali metals\nover a wide range of radiation frequencies.\n\n11.7  PARTICLE NATURE OF LIGHT: THE PHOTON\nPhotoelectric effect thus gave evidence to the strange fact that light in\ninteraction with matter behaved as if it was made of quanta or packets of\nenergy, each of energy h ν.\n\nIs the light quantum of energy to be associated with a particle? Einstein\narrived at the important result, that the light quantum can also be\nassociated with momentum (h ν/c ). A definite value of energy as well as\nmomentum is a strong sign that the light quantum can be associated\nwith a particle. This particle was later named photon. The particle-like\nbehaviour of light was further confirmed, in 1924, by the experiment of\nA.H. Compton (1892-1962) on scattering of X-rays from electrons. In\n1921, Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his contribution\nto theoretical physics and the photoelectric effect. In 1923, Millikan was\nawarded the Nobel Prize in physics for his work on the elementary\ncharge of electricity and on the photoelectric effect.\n\nWe can summarise the photon picture of electromagnetic  radiation\nas follows:\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n396\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n1\n.1\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n1\n.2\n\n(i) In interaction of radiation with matter, radiation behaves as if it is\nmade up of particles called photons.\n\n(ii) Each photon has energy E (=hν) and momentum p (= h ν/c), and\nspeed c, the speed of light.\n\n(iii) All photons of light of a particular frequency  ν, or wavelength λ, have\nthe same energy E (=hν  = hc/λ) and momentum  p (= hν/c = h/λ),\nwhatever the intensity of radiation may be. By increasing the intensity\nof light of given wavelength, there is only an increase in the number of\nphotons per second crossing a given area, with each photon having\nthe same energy. Thus, photon energy is independent of intensity of\nradiation.\n\n(iv) Photons are electrically neutral and are not deflected by electric and\nmagnetic fields.\n\n(v) In a photon-particle collision (such as photon-electron collision), the\ntotal energy and total momentum are conserved. However, the number\nof photons may not be conserved in a collision. The photon may be\nabsorbed or a new photon may be created.\n\nExample 11.1 Monochromatic light of frequency 6.0 ×1014 Hz is\nproduced by a laser. The power emitted is 2.0 ×10–3 W.

The wave nature of light shows up in the phenomena\nof interference, diffraction and polarisation. On the other hand, in\nphotoelectric effect and Compton effect which involve energy and\nmomentum transfer, radiation behaves as if it is made up of a bunch of\nparticles – the photons. Whether a particle or wave description is best\nsuited for understanding an experiment depends on the nature of the\nexperiment. For example, in the familiar  phenomenon of seeing an object\nby our eye, both descriptions are important. The gathering and focussing\nmechanism of light by the eye-lens is well described in the wave picture.\nBut its absorption by the rods and cones (of the retina) requires the photon\npicture of light.\n\nA natural question arises: If radiation has a dual (wave-particle) nature,\nmight not the particles of nature (the electrons, protons, etc.) also exhibit\nwave-like character? In 1924, the French physicist Louis Victor de Broglie\n(pronounced as de Broy) (1892-1987) put forward the bold hypothesis\nthat moving particles of matter should display wave-like properties under\nsuitable conditions. He reasoned that nature was symmetrical and that\nthe two basic physical entities – matter and energy, must have symmetrical\ncharacter. If radiation shows dual aspects, so should matter. De Broglie\nproposed that the wave length λ  associated with a particle of momentum\np is given as\n\nλ  = \nh h\n\np m v\n= (11.5)\n\nwhere m  is the mass of the particle and v its speed. Equation (11.5) is\nknown as the de Broglie relation and the wavelength λ of the matter\nwave is called de Broglie wavelength. The dual aspect of matter is evident\nin the de Broglie relation. On the left hand side of Eq. (11.5), λ  is the\nattribute of a wave while on the right hand side the momentum p is a\ntypical attribute of a particle. Planck’s constant  h  relates the two\nattributes.\n\nEquation (11.5) for a material particle is basically a hypothesis whose\nvalidity can be tested only by experiment. However, it is interesting to see\nthat it is satisfied also by a photon. For a photon, as we have seen,\n\np = hν /c (11.6)\n\nTherefore,\n\nh c\n\np\nλ\n\nν\n= = (11.7)\n\nThat is, the de Broglie wavelength of a photon given by Eq. (11.5) equals\nthe wavelength of electromagnetic radiation of which the photon is a\nquantum of energy and momentum.\n\nClearly, from Eq. (11.5 ), λ  is smaller for a heavier particle ( large m ) or\nmore energetic particle (large v). For example, the de Broglie wavelength\nof a ball of mass 0.12 kg moving with a speed of 20 m s–1 is easily\ncalculated:\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n399\n\nDual Nature of Radiation\n\nand Matter\n\np = m v = 0.12 kg × 20 m s–1 = 2.40 kg m s–1\n\nλ = \nh\n\np\n = \n\n34\n\n1\n\n6.63 10 J s\n2.40 kg m s\n\n−\n\n−\n\n×\n = 2.76 × 10–34 m\n\nPHOTOCELL\n\nA photocell is a technological application of the photoelectric effect. It is a device whose\nelectrical properties are affected by light. It is also sometimes called an electric eye. A photocell\nconsists of a semi-cylindrical photo-sensitive metal plate C (emitter) and a wire loop A\n(collector) supported in an evacuated glass or quartz bulb. It is connected to the external\ncircuit having a high-tension battery B and microammeter (µA) as shown in the Figure.\nSometimes, instead of the plate C, a thin layer of photosensitive material is pasted on the\ninside of the bulb. A part of the bulb is left clean for the light to enter it.\n\nWhen light of suitable wavelength falls on the\nemitter C, photoelectrons are emitted. These\nphotoelectrons are drawn to the collector A.\nPhotocurrent of the order of a few microampere\ncan be normally obtained from a photo cell.\n\nA photocell converts a change in intensity of\nillumination into a change in photocurrent. This\ncurrent can be used to operate control systems\nand in light measuring devices. A photocell of lead\nsulphide sensitive to infrared radiation is used\nin electronic ignition circuits.\n\nIn scientific work, photo cells are used\nwhenever it is necessary to measure the intensity\nof light. Light meters in photographic cameras\nmake use of photo cells to measure the intensity\nof incident light. The photocells, inserted in the\ndoor light electric circuit, are used as automatic\ndoor opener. A person approaching a doorway\nmay interrupt a light beam which is incident on\na photocell. The abrupt change in photocurrent\nmay be used to start a motor which opens the\ndoor or rings an alarm. They are used in the\ncontrol of a counting device which records every interruption of the light beam caused by a\nperson or object passing across the beam. So photocells help count the persons entering an\nauditorium, provided they enter the hall one by one. They are used for detection of traffic\nlaw defaulters: an alarm may be sounded whenever a beam of (invisible) radiation is\nintercepted.\n\nIn burglar alarm, (invisible) ultraviolet light is continuously made to fall on a photocell\ninstalled at the doorway. A person entering the door interrupts the beam falling on the\nphotocell. The abrupt change in photocurrent is used to start an electric bell ringing. In fire\nalarm, a number of photocells are installed at suitable places in a building. In the event of\nbreaking out of fire, light radiations fall upon the photocell. This completes the electric\ncircuit through an electric bell or a siren which starts operating as a warning signal.\n\nPhotocells are used in the reproduction of sound in motion pictures and in the television\ncamera for scanning and telecasting scenes. They are used in industries for detecting minor\nflaws or holes in metal sheets.\n\nA photo cell\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n400\n\nThis wavelength is so small that it is beyond any\nmeasurement. This is the reason why macroscopic objects\nin our daily life do not show wave-like properties. On the\nother hand, in the sub-atomic domain, the wave character\nof particles is significant and measurable.\n\nConsider an electron (mass m, charge e) accelerated\nfrom rest through a potential V. The kinetic energy K\nof the electron equals the work done (eV ) on it by the\nelectric field:\n\nK = e V (11.8)\n\nNow, K = \n1\n2\n\nm v\n2 = \n\n2\n\n2\np\n\nm\n , so that\n\np = 2  2  m K m e V= (11.9)\n\nThe de Broglie wavelength λ of the electron is then\n\nλ  =  \n2 2 \n\nh h h\n\np m K m eV\n= = (11.10)\n\nSubstituting the numerical values of h, m, e,\nwe get\n\n1.227\n   nm\n\nV\nλ = (11.11)\n\nwhere V is the magnitude of accelerating potential in\nvolts. For a 120 V accelerating potential, Eq. (11.11) gives\nλ  = 0.112 nm. This wavelength is of the same order as\nthe spacing between the atomic planes in crystals. This\n\nsuggests that matter waves associated with an electron could be verified\nby crystal diffraction experiments analogous to X-ray diffraction. We\ndescribe the experimental verification of the de Broglie hypothesis in the\nnext section. In 1929, de Broglie was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics\nfor his discovery of the wave nature of electrons.\n\nThe matter–wave picture elegantly incorporated the Heisenberg’s\nuncertainty principle. According to the principle, it is not possible to\nmeasure both the position and momentum of an electron (or any other\nparticle) at the same time exactly. There is always some uncertainty (∆ x )\nin the specification of position and some uncertainty (∆p ) in the\nspecification of momentum. The product of  ∆x and ∆p is of the order of ħ*\n(with ħ = h/2π), i.e.,\n\n∆x ∆p ≈ ħ (11.12)\n\nEquation (11.12) allows the possibility that ∆x is zero; but then ∆p\nmust be infinite in order that the product is non-zero. Similarly, if ∆p is\nzero, ∆x must be infinite. Ordinarily, both ∆x and ∆p are non-zero such\nthat their product is of the order of ħ.\n\nNow, if an electron has a definite momentum p, (i.e.∆p = 0), by the de\nBroglie relation, it has a definite wavelength λ.

By Born’s\nprobability interpretation this means that the\nelectron is not localised in any finite region of\nspace. That is, its position uncertainty is infinite\n(∆x → ∞), which is consistent with the\nuncertainty principle.\n\nIn general, the matter wave associated with\nthe electron is not extended all over space. It is\na wave packet extending over some finite region\nof space. In that case ∆x is not infinite but has\nsome finite value depending on the extension\nof the wave packet. Also, you must appreciate\nthat a wave packet of finite extension does not\nhave a single wavelength. It is built up of\nwavelengths spread around some central\nwavelength.\n\nBy de Broglie’s relation, then, the\nmomentum of the electron will also have a\nspread – an uncertainty ∆p. This is as expected\nfrom the uncertainty principle. It can be shown\nthat the wave packet description together with\nde Broglie relation and Born’s probability\ninterpretation reproduce the Heisenberg’s\nuncertainty principle exactly.\n\nIn Chapter 12, the de Broglie relation will\nbe seen to justify Bohr’s postulate on\nquantisation of angular momentum of electron\nin an atom.\n\nFigure 11.6 shows a schematic diagram of\n(a) a localised wave packet, and (b) an extended\nwave with fixed wavelength.\n\nExample 11.4 What is the de Broglie wavelength associated with (a) an\nelectron moving with a speed of 5.4×106 m/s, and (b) a ball of mass 150\ng travelling at 30.0 m/s?\n\nSolution\n(a) For the electron:\n\nMass m = 9.11×10–31 kg, speed v = 5.4×106 m/s.

Actually, a truly satisfactory physical understanding of the\ndual nature of matter and radiation has not emerged so far. The great founders of\nquantum mechanics (Niels Bohr, Albert Einstein, and many others) struggled with this\nand related concepts for long. Still the deep physical interpretation of quantum\nmechanics continues to be an area of active research. Despite this, the concept of\nmatter wave has been mathematically introduced in modern quantum mechanics with\ngreat success. An important milestone in this connection was when Max Born (1882-\n1970) suggested a probability interpretation to the matter wave amplitude. According\nto this, the intensity (square of the amplitude) of the matter wave at a point determines\nthe probability density of the particle  at that point. Probability density means probability\nper unit volume. Thus, if A is the amplitude of the wave at a point, |A|2 ∆V is the\nprobability of the particle being found in a small volume ∆V around that point. Thus,\nif the intensity of matter wave is large in a certain region, there is a greater probability\nof the particle being found there than where the intensity is small.\n\nExample 11.6 A particle is moving three times as fast as an electron.\nThe ratio of the de Broglie wavelength of the particle to that of the\nelectron is 1.813 × 10–4. Calculate the particle’s mass and identify the\nparticle.\n\nSolution\nde Broglie wavelength of a moving particle, having mass m  and\nvelocity v:\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n403\n\nDual Nature of Radiation\n\nand Matter\n\nh h\n\np mv\nλ = =\n\nMass, m = h/λv\nFor an electron, mass me = h/λe ve\nNow, we have v/ve = 3 and\nλ/λe  = 1.813 × 10\n\n–4\n\nThen, mass of the particle, m = me \ne e\n\nv\n\nv\n\nλ\n\nλ\n\n\uf8eb \uf8f6 \uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8ec \uf8f7 \uf8ec \uf8f7\uf8ed \uf8f8 \uf8ed \uf8f8\n\nm = (9.11×10–31 kg) × (1/3) × (1/1.813 × 10–4)\nm = 1.675 × 10–27 kg.\nThus, the particle, with this mass could be a proton or a neutron.\n\nExample 11.7 What is the de Broglie wavelength associated with an\nelectron, accelerated through a potential differnece of 100 volts?\n\nSolution  Accelerating potential V = 100 V.

Germer in 1927 and independently by G.P. Thomson,\nin 1928, who observed\ndiffraction effects with beams of\nelectrons scattered by crystals.\nDavisson and Thomson shared\nthe Nobel Prize in 1937 for their\nexperimental discovery of\ndiffraction of electrons by\ncrystals.\n\nThe experimental arrange-\nment used by Davisson and\nGermer is schematically shown\nin Fig. 11.7. It consists of an\nelectron gun which comprises of\na tungsten filament F, coated\nwith barium oxide and heated\nby a low voltage power supply\n(L.T. or battery). Electrons\nemitted by the filament are\naccelerated to a desired velocity\n\nFIGURE 11.7 Davisson-Germer electron\ndiffraction arrangement.\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n1\n.6\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n1\n.7\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n404\n\nby applying suitable potential/voltage from a high voltage power supply\n(H.T. or battery). They are made to pass through a cylinder with fine\nholes along its axis, producing a fine collimated beam. The beam is made\nto fall on the surface of a nickel crystal. The electrons are scattered in all\ndirections by the atoms of the crystal. The intensity of the electron beam,\nscattered in a given direction, is measured by the electron detector\n(collector). The detector can be moved on a circular scale and is connected\nto a sensitive galvanometer, which records the current. The deflection of\nthe galvanometer is proportional to the intensity of the electron beam\nentering the collector. The  apparatus is enclosed in an evacuated chamber.\nBy moving the  detector  on the circular scale at different positions, the\nintensity of the scattered electron beam is measured for different values\nof angle of scattering θ which is the angle between the incident and the\nscattered electron beams. The variation of the intensity (I ) of the scattered\nelectrons with the angle of scattering θ  is obtained for different accelerating\nvoltages.\n\nThe experiment was performed by varying the accelarating voltage\nfrom 44 V to 68 V. It was noticed that a strong peak appeared in the\nintensity (I ) of the scattered electron for an accelarating voltage of 54V at\na scattering angle θ = 50°\n\nThe appearance of the peak in a particular direction is due to the\nconstructive interference of electrons scattered from different layers of the\nregularly spaced atoms of the crystals. From the electron diffraction\nmeasurements, the wavelength of matter waves was found to be\n0.165 nm.\n\nThe de Broglie wavelength λ associated with electrons, using\nEq. (11.11), for V = 54 V is given by\n\nλ = h /p \n1 227\n\nV\n=  nm\n\nλ \n1 227\n\n54\n=  nm =  0.167 nm\n\nThus, there is an excellent agreement between the theoretical value\nand the experimentally obtained value of de Broglie wavelength. Davisson-\nGermer experiment thus strikingly confirms the wave nature of electrons\nand the de Broglie relation. More recently, in 1989, the wave nature of a\nbeam of electrons was experimentally demonstrated in a double-slit\nexperiment, similar to that used for the wave nature of light. Also, in an\nexperiment in 1994, interference fringes were obtained with the beams of\niodine molecules, which are about a million times more massive than\nelectrons.\n\nThe de Broglie hypothesis has been basic to the development of modern\nquantum mechanics. It has also led to the field of electron optics. The\nwave properties of electrons have been utilised in the design of electron\nmicroscope which is a great improvement, with higher resolution, over\nthe optical microscope.\n\nD\ne\nv\ne\nlo\n\np\nm\n\ne\nn\nt\n o\n\nf \ne\nle\n\nc\nt\nr\no\nn\n m\n\nic\nr\no\ns\nc\no\np\ne\n\nh\ntt\np\n:/\n/w\n\nw\nw\n\n.n\no\nb\ne\nlp\n\nri\nz\ne\n.o\n\nrg\n/n\n\no\nb\ne\nl_\n\np\nri\nz\ne\ns/\np\nh\ny\nsi\nc\ns/\nla\n\nu\nre\n\na\nte\n\ns/\n1\n9\n8\n6\n/p\n\nre\nse\n\nn\nta\n\nti\no\nn\n-s\n\np\ne\ne\nc\nh\n.h\n\ntm\nl\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n405\n\nDual Nature of Radiation\n\nand Matter\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. The minimum energy needed by an electron to come out from a  metal\nsurface is called the work function of the metal. Energy (greater than\nthe work function (φ\n\nο\n)\n \nrequired for electron emission from the metal\n\nsurface can be supplied by suitably heating or applying strong electric\nfield or irradiating it by light of suitable frequency.\n\n2. Photoelectric effect is the phenomenon of emission of electrons by metals\nwhen illuminated by light of suitable frequency. Certain metals respond\nto ultraviolet light while others are sensitive even to the visible light.\nPhotoelectric effect involves conversion of light energy into electrical\nenergy. It follows the law of conservation of energy. The photoelectric\nemission is an instantaneous process and possesses certain special\nfeatures.\n\n3. Photoelectric current depends on (i) the intensity of incident light, (ii)\nthe potential difference applied between the two electrodes, and (iii)\nthe nature of the emitter material.\n\n4. The stopping potential (V\no\n) depends on (i) the frequency of incident\n\nlight, and (ii) the nature of the emitter material. For a given frequency\nof incident light, it is independent of its intensity. The stopping potential\nis directly related to the maximum kinetic energy of electrons emitted:\ne V\n\n0\n = (1/2) m v2\n\nmax\n = K\n\nmax\n.\n\n5. Below a certain frequency (threshold frequency) ν\n0\n, characteristic of\n\nthe metal, no photoelectric emission takes place, no matter how large\nthe intensity may be.\n\n6. The classical wave theory could not explain the main features of\nphotoelectric effect. Its picture of continuous absorption of energy from\nradiation could not explain the independence of K\n\nmax\n on intensity, the\n\nexistence of ν\no\n and the instantaneous nature of the process. Einstein\n\nexplained these features on the basis of photon picture of light.\nAccording to this, light is composed of discrete packets of energy called\nquanta or photons. Each photon carries an energy E (= h ν) and\nmomentum p (= h/λ), which depend on the frequency (ν ) of incident\nlight and not on its intensity. Photoelectric emission from the metal\nsurface occurs due to absorption of a photon by an electron.\n\n7. Einstein’s photoelectric equation is in accordance with the energy\nconservation law as applied to the photon absorption by an electron in\nthe metal. The maximum kinetic energy (1/2)m v2\n\nmax\n is equal to\n\nthe photon energy (hν ) minus the work function φ\n0 \n\n(= hν\n0\n) of the\n\ntarget metal:\n\n1\n2\n\nm v2\nmax\n\n = V\n0\n e = hν – φ\n\n0 \n= h (ν – ν\n\n0\n)\n\nThis photoelectric equation explains all the features of the photoelectric\neffect. Millikan’s first precise measurements confirmed the Einstein’s\nphotoelectric equation and obtained an accurate value of Planck’s\nconstant h . This led to the acceptance of particle or photon description\n(nature) of electromagnetic radiation, introduced by Einstein.\n\n8. Radiation has dual nature: wave and particle. The nature of experiment\ndetermines whether a wave or particle description is best suited for\nunderstanding the experimental result. Reasoning that radiation and\nmatter should be symmetrical in nature, Louis Victor de Broglie\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n406\n\nattributed a wave-like character to matter (material particles). The waves\nassociated with the moving material particles are called matter waves\nor de Broglie waves.\n\n 9. The de Broglie wavelength (λ) associated with a moving particle is related\nto its momentum p as:  λ = h/p. The dualism of matter is inherent in the\nde Broglie relation which contains a wave concept (λ) and a particle concept\n(p). The de Broglie wavelength is independent of the charge and nature of\nthe material  particle. It is significantly measurable (of the order of the\natomic-planes spacing in crystals) only in case of sub-atomic particles\nlike electrons, protons, etc. (due to smallness of their masses and hence,\nmomenta). However, it is indeed very small, quite beyond measurement,\nin case of macroscopic objects, commonly  encountered in everyday life.\n\n10. Electron diffraction experiments by Davisson and Germer, and by G. P.\nThomson, as well as many later experiments, have verified and confirmed\nthe wave-nature of electrons. The de Broglie hypothesis of matter waves\nsupports the Bohr’s concept of stationary orbits.\n\nPhysical Symbol Dimensions Unit Remarks\nQuantity\n\nPlanck’s h [ML2 T –1] J s E = hν\n\nconstant\n\nStopping V\n0\n\n[ML2 T –3A–1] V e V\n0\n= K\n\nmax\n\npotential\n\nWork φ\n0\n\n[ML2 T –2] J; eV K\nmax \n\n= E –φ\n0\n\nfunction\n\nThreshold ν\n0\n\n[T –1] Hz ν\n0 \n= φ\n\n0\n/h\n\nfrequency\n\nde Broglie λ [L] m λ= h/p\nwavelength\n\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n\n1. Free electrons in a metal are free in the sense that they move inside the\nmetal in a constant potential (This is only an approximation). They are\nnot free to move out of the metal. They need additional energy to get\nout of the metal.\n\n2. Free electrons in a metal do not all have the same energy. Like molecules\nin a gas jar, the electrons have a certain energy distribution at a given\ntemperature. This distribution is different from the usual Maxwell’s\ndistribution that you have learnt in the study of kinetic theory of gases.\nYou will learn about it in later courses, but the difference has to do\nwith the fact that electrons obey Pauli’s exclusion principle.\n\n3. Because of the energy distribution of free electrons in a metal, the\nenergy required by an electron to come out of the metal is different for\ndifferent electrons. Electrons with higher energy require less additional\nenergy to come out of the metal than those with lower energies. Work\nfunction is the least energy required by an electron to come out of the\nmetal.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n407\n\nDual Nature of Radiation\n\nand Matter\n\n4. Observations on photoelectric effect imply that in the event of matter-\nlight interaction, absorption of energy takes place in discrete units of hν.\nThis is not quite the same as saying that light consists of particles,\neach of energy hν.\n\n5. Observations on the stopping potential (its independence of intensity\nand dependence on frequency) are the crucial discriminator between\nthe wave-picture and photon-picture of photoelectric effect.\n\n6. The wavelength of a matter wave given by \nh\n\np\nλ =   has physical\n\nsignificance; its phase velocity  vp has no physical significance. However,\nthe group velocity of the matter wave is physically meaningful and\nequals the velocity of the particle.\n\nEXERCISES\n\n11.1 Find the\n(a) maximum frequency, and\n\n(b) minimum wavelength of X-rays produced by 30 kV electrons.\n\n11.2 The work function of caesium metal is 2.14 eV.

But systematic experiments were done by\nscientists since the dawn of the scientific and industrial era, about four centuries ago. Around the same time,\ntheoretical models about what light is made of were developed. While building a model in any branch of\nscience, it is essential to see that it is able to explain all the experimental observations existing at that time.\nIt is therefore appropriate to summarize some observations about light that were known in the seventeenth\ncentury.\n\nThe properties of light known at that time included (a) rectilinear propagation of light, (b) reflection from\nplane and curved surfaces, (c) refraction at the boundary of two media, (d) dispersion into various colours, (e)\nhigh speed. Appropriate laws were formulated for the first four phenomena. For example, Snell formulated his\nlaws of refraction in 1621. Several scientists right from the days of Galileo had tried to measure the speed of\nlight. But they had not been able to do so. They had only concluded that it was higher than the limit of their\nmeasurement.\n\nTwo models of light were also proposed in the seventeenth century. Descartes, in early decades of seventeenth\ncentury, proposed that light consists of particles, while Huygens, around 1650-60, proposed that light consists\nof waves. Descartes′ proposal was merely a philosophical model, devoid of any experiments or scientific\narguments. Newton soon after, around 1660-70, extended Descartes′ particle model, known as corpuscular\ntheory, built it up as a scientific theory, and explained various known properties with it. These models, light\nas waves and as particles, in a sense, are quite opposite of each other. But both models could explain all the\nknown properties of light. There was nothing to choose between them.\n\nThe history of the development of these models over the next few centuries is interesting. Bartholinus, in\n1669, discovered double refraction of light in some crystals, and Huygens, in 1678, was quick to explain it on\nthe basis of his wave theory of light. In spite of this, for over one hundred years, Newton’s particle model was\nfirmly believed and preferred over the wave model. This was partly because of its simplicity and partly because\nof Newton’s influence on contemporary physics.\n\nThen in 1801, Young performed his double-slit experiment and observed interference fringes. This\nphenomenon could be explained only by wave theory. It was realized that diffraction was also another\nphenomenon which could be explained only by wave theory. In fact, it was a natural consequence of Huygens\nidea of secondary wavelets emanating from every point in the path of light. These experiments could not be\nexplained by assuming that light consists of particles. Another phenomenon of polarisation was discovered\naround 1810, and this too could be naturally explained by the wave theory. Thus wave theory of Huygens\ncame to the forefront and Newton’s particle theory went into the background. This situation again continued\nfor almost a century.\n\nBetter experiments were performed in the nineteenth century to determine the speed of light. With more\naccurate experiments, a value of 3×108 m/s for speed of light in vacuum was arrived at. Around 1860, Maxwell\nproposed his equations of electromagnetism and it was realized that all electromagnetic phenomena known at\nthat time could be explained by Maxwell’s four equations. Soon Maxwell showed that electric and magnetic\nfields could propagate through empty space (vacuum) in the form of electromagnetic waves. He calculated the\nspeed of these waves and arrived at a theoretical value of 2.998×108  m/s. The close agreement of this value\nwith the experimental value suggested that light consists of electromagnetic waves. In 1887 Hertz demonstrated\nthe generation and detection of such waves. This established the wave theory of light on a firm footing. We\nmight say that while eighteenth century belonged to the particle model, the nineteenth century belonged to\nthe wave model of light.\n\nVast amounts of experiments were done during the period 1850-1900 on heat and related phenomena, an\naltogether different area of physics. Theories and models like kinetic theory and thermodynamics were developed\nwhich quite successfully explained the various phenomena, except one.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n413\n\nDual Nature of Radiation\n\nand Matter\n\nEvery body at any temperature emits radiation of all wavelengths. It also absorbs radiation falling on it.\nA body which absorbs all the radiation falling on it is called a black body. It is an ideal concept in physics, like\nconcepts of a point mass or uniform motion. A graph of the intensity of radiation emitted by a black body\nversus wavelength is called the black body spectrum. No theory in those days could explain the complete black\nbody spectrum!\n\nIn 1900, Planck hit upon a novel idea. If we assume, he said, that radiation is emitted in packets of energy\ninstead of continuously as in a wave, then we can explain the black body spectrum. Planck himself regarded\nthese quanta, or packets, as a property of emission and absorption, rather than that of light. He derived a\nformula which agreed with the entire spectrum. This was a confusing mixture of wave and particle pictures –\nradiation is emitted as a particle, it travels as a wave, and is again absorbed as a particle! Moreover, this put\nphysicists in a dilemma. Should we again accept the particle picture of light just to explain one phenomenon?\nThen what happens to the phenomena of interference and diffraction which cannot be explained by the\nparticle model?\n\nBut soon in 1905, Einstein explained the photoelectric effect by assuming the particle picture of light.\nIn 1907, Debye explained the low temperature specific heats of solids by using the particle picture for lattice\nvibrations in a crystalline solid. Both these phenomena belonging to widely diverse areas of physics could be\nexplained only by the particle model and not by the wave model. In 1923, Compton’s x-ray scattering experiments\nfrom atoms also went in favour of the particle picture. This increased the dilemma further.\n\nThus by 1923, physicists faced with the following situation. (a) There were some phenomena like rectilinear\npropagation, reflection, refraction, which could be explained by either particle model or by wave model. (b)\nThere were some phenomena such as diffraction and interference which could be explained only by the wave\nmodel but not by the particle model. (c) There were some phenomena such as black body radiation, photoelectric\neffect, and Compton scattering which could be explained only by the particle model but not by the wave model.\nSomebody in those days aptly remarked that light behaves as a particle on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays,\nand as a wave on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, and we don’t talk of light on Sundays!\n\nIn 1924, de Broglie proposed his theory of wave-particle duality in which he said that not only photons\nof light but also ‘particles’ of matter such as electrons and atoms possess a dual character, sometimes\nbehaving like a particle and sometimes as a wave. He gave a formula connecting their mass, velocity, momentum\n(particle characteristics), with their wavelength and frequency (wave characteristics)! In 1927 Thomson, and\nDavisson and Germer, in separate experiments, showed that electrons did behave like waves with a wavelength\nwhich agreed with that given by de Broglie’s formula. Their experiment was on diffraction of electrons through\ncrystalline solids, in which the regular arrangement of atoms acted like a grating. Very soon, diffraction\nexperiments with other ‘particles’ such as neutrons and protons were performed and these too confirmed with\nde Broglie’s formula. This confirmed wave-particle duality as an established principle of physics. Here was a\nprinciple, physicists thought, which explained all the phenomena mentioned above not only for light but also\nfor the so-called particles.\n\nBut there was no basic theoretical foundation for wave-particle duality. De Broglie’s proposal was\nmerely a qualitative argument based on symmetry of nature. Wave-particle duality was at best a principle, not\nan outcome of a sound fundamental theory. It is true that all experiments whatever agreed with de Broglie\nformula. But physics does not work that way. On the one hand, it needs experimental confirmation, while on\nthe other hand, it also needs sound theoretical basis for the models proposed. This was developed over the\nnext two decades. Dirac developed his theory of radiation in about 1928, and Heisenberg and Pauli gave it a\nfirm footing by 1930. Tomonaga, Schwinger, and Feynman, in late 1940s, produced further refinements and\ncleared the theory of inconsistencies which were noticed. All these theories mainly put wave-particle duality\non a theoretical footing.\n\nAlthough the story continues, it grows more and more complex and beyond the scope of this note. But\nwe have here the essential structure of what happened, and let us be satisfied with it at the moment. Now it\nis regarded as a natural consequence of present theories of physics that electromagnetic radiation as well as\nparticles of matter exhibit both wave and particle properties in different experiments, and sometimes even in\nthe different parts of the same experiment.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 12.pmd\n\n\nPhysics\n\n414\n\n12.1  INTRODUCTION\nBy the nineteenth century, enough evidence had accumulated in favour of\natomic hypothesis of matter. In 1897, the experiments on electric discharge\nthrough gases carried out by the English physicist J. J. Thomson (1856 –\n1940) revealed that atoms of different elements contain negatively charged\nconstituents (electrons) that are identical for all atoms. However, atoms on a\nwhole are electrically neutral. Therefore, an atom must also contain some\npositive charge to neutralise the negative charge of the electrons. But what\nis the arrangement of the positive charge and the electrons inside the atom?\nIn other words, what is the structure of an atom?\n\nThe first model of atom was proposed by J. J. Thomson in 1898.\nAccording to this model, the positive charge of the atom is uniformly\ndistributed throughout the volume of the atom and the negatively charged\nelectrons are embedded in it like seeds in a watermelon. This model was\npicturesquely called plum pudding model of the atom. However\nsubsequent studies on atoms, as described in this chapter, showed that\nthe distribution of the electrons and positive charges are very different\nfrom that proposed in this model.\n\nWe know that condensed matter (solids and liquids) and dense gases at\nall temperatures emit electromagnetic radiation in which a continuous\ndistribution of several wavelengths is present, though with different\nintensities. This radiation is considered to be due to oscillations of atoms\n\nChapter Twelve\n\nATOMS\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n415\n\nAtoms\n\nand molecules, governed by the interaction of each atom or\nmolecule with its neighbours. In contrast, light emitted from\nrarefied gases heated in a flame, or excited electrically in a\nglow tube such as the familiar neon sign or mercury vapour\nlight has only certain discrete wavelengths. The spectrum\nappears as a series of bright lines. In such gases, the\naverage spacing between atoms is large. Hence, the\nradiation emitted can be considered due to individual atoms\nrather than because of interactions between atoms or\nmolecules.\n\nIn the early nineteenth century it was also established\nthat each element is associated with a characteristic\nspectrum of radiation, for example, hydrogen always gives\na set of lines with fixed relative position between the lines.\nThis fact suggested an intimate relationship between the\ninternal structure of an atom and the spectrum of\nradiation emitted by it. In 1885, Johann Jakob Balmer\n(1825 – 1898) obtained a simple empirical formula which\ngave the wavelengths of a group of lines emitted by atomic\nhydrogen. Since hydrogen is simplest of the elements\nknown, we shall consider its spectrum in detail in this\nchapter.\n\nErnst Rutherford (1871–1937), a former research\nstudent of J. J. Thomson, was engaged in experiments on\nα-particles emitted by some radioactive elements. In 1906,\nhe proposed a classic experiment of scattering of these\nα-particles by atoms to investigate the atomic structure.\nThis experiment was later performed around 1911 by Hans\nGeiger (1882–1945) and Ernst Marsden (1889–1970, who\nwas 20 year-old student and had not yet earned his\nbachelor’s degree). The details are discussed in Section\n12.2. The explanation of the results led to the birth of\nRutherford’s planetary model of atom (also called the\nnuclear model of the atom). According to this the entire\npositive charge and most of the mass of the atom is\nconcentrated in a small volume called the nucleus with electrons revolving\naround the nucleus just as planets revolve around the sun.\n\nRutherford’s nuclear model was a major step towards how we see\nthe atom today. However, it could not explain why atoms emit light of\nonly discrete wavelengths. How could an atom as simple as hydrogen,\nconsisting of a single electron and a single proton, emit a complex\nspectrum of specific wavelengths? In the classical picture of an atom, the\nelectron revolves round the nucleus much like the way a planet revolves\nround the sun. However, we shall see that there are some serious\ndifficulties in accepting such a model.\n\n12.2 ALPHA-PARTICLE SCATTERING AND\nRUTHERFORD’S NUCLEAR MODEL OF ATOM\n\nAt the suggestion of Ernst Rutherford, in 1911, H. Geiger and E. Marsden\nperformed some experiments. In one of their experiments, as shown in\n\nErnst Rutherford (1871 –\n1937)  New Zealand born,\nBritish physicist who did\npioneering work on\nradioactive radiation. He\ndiscovered alpha-rays and\nbeta-rays. Along with\nFederick Soddy, he created\nthe modern theory of\nradioactivity. He studied\nthe ‘emanation’ of thorium\nand discovered a new noble\ngas, an isotope of radon,\nnow known as thoron. By\nscattering alpha-rays from\nthe metal foils, he\ndiscovered the atomic\nnucleus and proposed the\nplenatery model of the\natom. He also estimated the\napproximate size of the\nnucleus.\n\nE\nR\n\nN\nS\n\nT\n R\n\nU\nT\nH\n\nE\nR\n\nF\nO\n\nR\nD\n\n (1\n8\n7\n1\n – 1\n\n9\n3\n7\n)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n416\n\nFig. 12.1, they directed a beam of\n5.5 MeV α-particles emitted from a\n214\n83Bi  radioactive source at a thin metal\n\nfoil made of gold. Figure 12.2 shows a\nschematic diagram of this experiment.\nAlpha-particles emitted by a 214\n\n83Bi\nradioactive source were collimated into\na narrow beam by their passage\nthrough lead bricks. The beam was\nallowed to fall on a thin foil of gold of\nthickness 2.1 × 10–7 m. The scattered\nalpha-particles were observed through\na rotatable detector consisting of zinc\nsulphide screen and a microscope. The\nscattered alpha-particles on striking\nthe screen produced brief light flashes\nor scintillations. These flashes may be\nviewed through a microscope and the\ndistribution of the number of scattered\nparticles may be studied as a function\nof angle of scattering.\n\nFIGURE 12.2 Schematic arrangement of the Geiger-Marsden experiment.\n\nA typical graph of the total number of α-particles scattered at different\nangles, in a given interval of time, is shown in Fig. 12.3. The dots in this\nfigure represent the data points and the solid curve is the theoretical\nprediction based on the assumption that the target atom has a small,\ndense, positively charged nucleus. Many of the α-particles pass through\nthe foil. It means that they do not suffer any collisions. Only about 0.14%\nof the incident α-particles scatter by more than 1°; and about 1 in 8000\ndeflect by more than 90°. Rutherford argued that, to deflect the α-particle\nbackwards, it must experience a large repulsive force. This force could\n\nFIGURE 12.1 Geiger-Marsden scattering experiment.\nThe entire apparatus is placed in a vacuum chamber\n\n(not shown in this figure).\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n417\n\nAtoms\n\nbe provided if the greater part of the\nmass of the atom and its positive charge\nwere concentrated tightly at its centre.\nThen the incoming α-particle could get\nvery close to the positive charge without\npenetrating it, and such a close\nencounter would result in a large\ndeflection. This agreement supported\nthe hypothesis of the nuclear atom. This\nis why Rutherford is credited with the\ndiscovery of the nucleus.\n\nIn Rutherford’s nuclear model of\nthe atom, the entire positive charge and\nmost of the mass of the atom are\nconcentrated in the nucleus with the\nelectrons some distance away. The\nelectrons would be moving in orbits\nabout the nucleus just as the planets\ndo around the sun. Rutherford’s\nexperiments suggested the size of\nthe nucleus to be about 10–15 m to\n10–14 m. From kinetic theory, the size\nof an atom was known to be 10–10 m,\nabout 10,000 to 100,000 times larger\nthan the size of the nucleus (see Chapter 11, Section 11.6 in Class XI\nPhysics textbook). Thus, the electrons would seem to be at a distance\nfrom the nucleus of about 10,000 to 100,000 times the size of the nucleus\nitself. Thus, most of an atom is empty space. With the atom being largely\nempty space, it is easy to see why most α-particles go right through a\nthin metal foil. However, when α-particle happens to come near a nucleus,\nthe intense electric field there scatters it through a large angle. The atomic\nelectrons, being so light, do not appreciably affect the α-particles.\n\nThe scattering data shown in Fig. 12.3 can be analysed by employing\nRutherford’s nuclear model of the atom. As the gold foil is very thin, it\ncan be assumed that α-particles will suffer not more than one scattering\nduring their passage through it. Therefore, computation of the trajectory\nof an alpha-particle scattered by a single nucleus is enough. Alpha-\nparticles are nuclei of helium atoms and, therefore, carry two units, 2e,\nof positive charge and have the mass of the helium atom. The charge of\nthe gold nucleus is Ze, where Z is the atomic number of the atom; for\ngold Z = 79. Since the nucleus of gold is about 50 times heavier than an\nα-particle, it is reasonable to assume that it remains stationary\nthroughout the scattering process. Under these assumptions, the\ntrajectory of an alpha-particle can be computed employing Newton’s\nsecond law of motion and the Coulomb’s law for electrostatic\nforce of repulsion between the alpha-particle and the positively\ncharged nucleus.\n\nFIGURE 12.3 Experimental data points (shown by\ndots) on scattering of α-particles by a thin foil at\ndifferent angles obtained by Geiger and Marsden\n\nusing the setup shown in Figs. 12.1 and\n12.2. Rutherford’s nuclear model predicts the solid\ncurve which is seen to be in good agreement with\n\nexperiment.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n418  E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n2\n.1\n\nThe magnitude of this force is\n\n2\n0\n\n(2 )( )1\n4\n\ne Ze\nF\n\nrε\n=\n\nπ\n(12.1)\n\nwhere r is the distance between the α-particle and the nucleus. The force\nis directed along the line joining the α-particle and the nucleus. The\nmagnitude and direction of the force on an α-particle continuously\nchanges as it approaches the nucleus and recedes away from it.\n\n12.2.1  Alpha-particle trajectory\n\nThe trajectory traced by an α-particle depends on the impact parameter,\nb of collision. The impact parameter is the perpendicular distance of the\ninitial velocity vector of the α-particle from the centre of the nucleus (Fig.\n\n12.4). A given beam of α-particles has a\ndistribution of impact parameters b, so that\nthe beam is scattered in various directions\nwith different probabilities (Fig. 12.4). (In\na beam, all particles have nearly same\nkinetic energy.) It is seen that an α-particle\nclose to the nucleus (small impact\nparameter) suffers large scattering. In case\nof head-on collision, the impact parameter\nis minimum and the α-particle rebounds\nback (θ  ≅ π). For a large impact parameter,\nthe α-particle goes nearly undeviated and\nhas a small deflection (θ  ≅ 0).\n\nThe fact that only a small fraction of the\nnumber of incident particles rebound back\nindicates that the number of α-particles\nundergoing head on collision is small. This,\n\nin turn, implies that the mass and positive charge of the atom is\nconcentrated in a small volume. Rutherford scattering therefore, is a\npowerful way to determine an upper limit to the size of the nucleus.\n\nFIGURE 12.4 Trajectory of α-particles in the\ncoulomb field of a target nucleus. The impact\n\nparameter, b and scattering angle θ\nare also depicted.\n\nExample 12.1 In the Rutherford’s nuclear model of the atom, the\nnucleus (radius about 10–15 m) is analogous to the sun about which\nthe electron move in orbit (radius ≈ 10–10 m) like the earth orbits\naround the sun. If the dimensions of the solar system had the same\nproportions as those of the atom, would the earth be closer to or\nfarther away from the sun than actually it is? The radius of earth’s\norbit is about 1.5 × 1011 m. The radius of sun is taken as 7 × 108 m.\n\nSolution The ratio of the radius of electron’s orbit to the radius of\nnucleus is (10–10 m)/(10–15 m) = 105, that is, the radius of the electron’s\norbit is 105 times larger than the radius of nucleus. If the radius of\nthe earth’s orbit around the sun were 105 times larger than the radius\nof the sun, the radius of the earth’s orbit would be 105 × 7 × 108 m =\n7 × 1013 m. This is more than 100 times greater than the actual\norbital radius of earth. Thus, the earth would be much farther away\nfrom the sun.\nIt implies that an atom contains a much greater fraction of empty\nspace than our solar system does.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n419\n\nAtoms\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n2\n.2\n\nExample 12.2 In a Geiger-Marsden experiment, what is the distance\nof closest approach to the nucleus of a 7.7 MeV α-particle before it\ncomes momentarily to rest and reverses its direction?\n\nSolution The key idea here is that throughout the scattering process,\nthe total mechanical energy of the system consisting of an α-particle\nand a gold nucleus is conserved. The system’s initial mechanical\nenergy is E\n\ni\n, before the particle and nucleus interact, and it is equal\n\nto its mechanical energy E\nf\n when the α-particle momentarily stops.\n\nThe initial energy E\ni\n is just the kinetic energy K\n\n \nof the incoming\n\nα- particle. The final energy E\nf\n is just the electric potential energy U\n\nof the system. The potential energy U  can be calculated from\nEq. (12.1).\nLet d be the centre-to-centre distance between the α-particle and\nthe gold nucleus when the α-particle is at its stopping point. Then\nwe can write the conservation of energy E\n\ni\n = E\n\nf\n as\n\n2\n\n0 0\n\n1 (2 )( ) 2\n4 4\n\ne Ze Ze\nK\n\nddε ε\n= =\n\nπ π\n\nThus the distance of closest approach d is given by\n2\n\n0\n\n2\n4\n\nZe\nd\n\nKε\n=\n\nπ\n\nThe maximum kinetic energy found in α-particles of natural origin is\n7.7 MeV or 1.2 × 10–12 J. Since 1/4πε\n\n0\n = 9.0 × 109 N m2/C2. Therefore\n\nwith e = 1.6 × 10–19 C, we have,\n9 2 2 –19 2\n\n12\n\n(2)(9.0 10 Nm / )(1.6 10 ) Z\n\n1.2 10 J\n\nC C\nd\n\n−\n\n× ×\n=\n\n×\n\n   = 3.84 × 10–16 Z m\nThe atomic number of foil material gold is Z = 79, so that\n\nd (Au) = 3.0 × 10–14 m = 30 fm. (1 fm (i.e. fermi) = 10–15 m.)\n\nThe radius of gold nucleus is, therefore, less than 3.0 × 10–14 m. This\nis not in very good agreement with the observed result as the actual\nradius of gold nucleus is 6 fm. The cause of discrepancy is that the\ndistance of closest approach is considerably larger than the sum of\nthe radii of the gold nucleus and the α-particle. Thus, the α-particle\nreverses its motion without ever actually touching the gold nucleus.\n\n12.2.2  Electron orbits\n\nThe Rutherford nuclear model of the atom which involves classical\nconcepts, pictures the atom as an electrically neutral sphere consisting\nof a very small, massive and positively charged nucleus at the centre\nsurrounded by the revolving electrons in their respective dynamically\nstable orbits. The electrostatic force of attraction, F\n\ne\n between the revolving\n\nelectrons and the nucleus provides the requisite centripetal force  (F\nc\n)  to\n\nkeep them in their orbits. Thus, for a  dynamically stable orbit in a\nhydrogen atom\n\n    F\ne\n = F\n\nc\n\n2 2\n\n2\n0\n\n1\n4 ε\n\n=\nπ\n\ne mv\n\nrr\n(12.2)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n420\n\nThus the relation between the orbit radius and the electron\nvelocity is\n\n2\n\n2\n04\ne\n\nr\nmvε\n\n=\nπ\n\n(12.3)\n\nThe kinetic energy (K ) and electrostatic potential energy (U ) of the electron\nin hydrogen atom are\n\n2 2\n2\n\n0 0\n\n1\n and \n\n2 8 4\ne e\n\nK mv U\nr rε ε\n\n= = = −\nπ π\n\n(The negative sign in U signifies that the electrostatic force is in the –r\ndirection.)

This implies the fact that\nthe electron is bound to the nucleus. If E were positive, an electron will\nnot follow a closed orbit around the nucleus.\n\n12.3  ATOMIC SPECTRA\nAs mentioned in Section 12.1, each element has a characteristic spectrum\nof radiation, which it emits. When an atomic gas or vapour is excited at\nlow pressure, usually by passing an electric current through it, the emitted\nradiation has a spectrum which contains certain specific wavelengths\nonly.

The\nspectrum emitted by atomic\nhydrogen is shown in\nFig. 12.5. Study of emission\nline spectra of a material can\ntherefore serve as a type of\n“fingerprint” for identification\nof the gas. When white light\npasses through a gas and we\nanalyse the transmitted light\nusing a spectrometer we find\nsome dark lines in the\nspectrum. These dark lines\ncorrespond precisely to those wavelengths which were found in the\nemission line spectrum of the gas. This is called the absorption spectrum\nof the material of the gas.\n\n12.3.1  Spectral series\n\nWe might expect that the frequencies of the light emitted by a particular\nelement would exhibit some regular pattern. Hydrogen is the simplest\natom and therefore, has the simplest spectrum. In the observed spectrum,\nhowever, at first sight, there does not seem to be\nany resemblance of order or regularity in spectral\nlines. But the spacing between lines within certain\nsets of the hydrogen spectrum decreases in a\nregular way (Fig. 12.5). Each of these sets is called\na spectral series. In 1885, the first such series was\nobserved by a Swedish school teacher Johann Jakob\nBalmer (1825–1898) in the visible region of the\nhydrogen spectrum. This series is called Balmer\nseries (Fig. 12.6). The line with the longest\nwavelength, 656.3 nm in the red is called H\n\nα\n;\n \nthe\n\nnext line with wavelength 486.1 nm in the blue-\ngreen is called H\n\nβ\n, the third line 434.1 nm in the\n\nviolet is called H\nγ\n;\n \nand so on. As the wavelength\n\ndecreases, the lines appear closer together and are weaker in intensity.\nBalmer found a simple empirical formula for the observed wavelengths\n\n2 2\n\n1 1 1\n2\n\nR\nnλ\n\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n= −\uf8ec \uf8f7\uf8ed \uf8f8\n\n(12.5)\n\nwhere λ is the wavelength, R is a constant called the Rydberg constant,\nand n may have integral values 3, 4, 5, etc. The value of R is 1.097 × 107 m–1.\nThis equation is also called Balmer formula.\n\nTaking n = 3 in Eq.

This is the shortest wavelength in\nthe Balmer series. Beyond this limit, no further distinct lines appear,\ninstead only a faint continuous spectrum is seen.\n\nOther series of spectra for hydrogen were subsequently discovered.\nThese are known, after their discoverers, as Lyman, Paschen, Brackett,\nand Pfund series. These are represented by the formulae:\n\nLyman series:\n\n1 1\n1\n\n1\n2 2\n\nλ\n= −\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f7R\n\nn\nn = 2,3,4...

(12.5) – (12.9).\n\nEquations (12.5) – (12.9) are useful as they give the wavelengths that\nhydrogen atoms radiate or absorb. However, these results are empirical\nand do not give any reasoning why only certain frequencies are observed\nin the hydrogen spectrum.\n\n12.4  BOHR MODEL OF THE HYDROGEN ATOM\nThe model of the atom proposed by Rutherford assumes that the atom,\nconsisting of a central nucleus and revolving electron is stable much like\nsun-planet system which the model imitates. However, there are some\nfundamental differences between the two situations. While the planetary\nsystem is held by gravitational force, the nucleus-electron system being\ncharged objects, interact by Coulomb’s Law of force. We know that an\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n423\n\nAtoms\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n2\n.4\n\nobject which moves in a circle is being constantly\naccelerated – the acceleration being centripetal in nature.\nAccording to classical electromagnetic theory, an\naccelerating charged particle emits radiation in the form\nof electromagnetic waves. The energy of an accelerating\nelectron should therefore, continuously decrease. The\nelectron would spiral inward and eventually fall into the\nnucleus (Fig. 12.7). Thus, such an atom can not be stable.\nFurther, according to the classical electromagnetic theory,\nthe frequency of the electromagnetic waves emitted by\nthe revolving electrons is equal to the frequency of\nrevolution. As the electrons spiral inwards, their angular\nvelocities and hence their frequencies would change\ncontinuously, and so will the frequency of the light\nemitted. Thus, they would emit a continuous spectrum,\nin contradiction to the line spectrum actually observed.\nClearly Rutherford model tells only a part of the story\nimplying that the classical ideas are not sufficient to\nexplain the atomic structure.\n\nFIGURE 12.7 An accelerated atomic electron must spiral into the\nnucleus as it loses energy.\n\nExample 12.4 According to the classical electromagnetic theory,\ncalculate the initial frequency of the light emitted by the electron\nrevolving around a proton in hydrogen atom.\n\nSolution From Example 12.3 we know that velocity of electron moving\naround a proton in hydrogen atom in an orbit of radius 5.3 × 10–11 m\nis 2.2 × 10–6 m/s. Thus, the frequency of the electron moving around\nthe proton is\n\n( )\n\n6 1\n\n11\n\n2.2 10  m s\n2 2 5.3 10  m\n\nv\n\nr\nν\n\n−\n\n−\n\n×\n= =\n\nπ π ×\n\n≈ 6.6 × 1015 Hz.\nAccording to the classical electromagnetic theory we know that the\nfrequency of the electromagnetic waves emitted by the revolving\nelectrons is equal to the frequency of its revolution around the nucleus.\nThus the initial frequency of the light emitted is 6.6 × 1015 Hz.\n\nNiels Henrik David Bohr\n\n(1885 – 1962)  Danish\nphysicist who explained the\nspectrum of hydrogen atom\nbased on quantum ideas.\nHe gave a theory of nuclear\nfission based on the liquid-\ndrop model of nucleus.\nBohr contributed to the\nclarification of conceptual\nproblems in quantum\nmechanics, in particular by\nproposing the comple-\nmentary principle.\n\nN\nIE\n\nL\nS\n\n H\nE\n\nN\nR\n\nIK\n D\n\nA\nV\n\nID\n B\n\nO\nH\n\nR\n (1\n\n8\n8\n5\n – 1\n\n9\n6\n2\n)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n424\n\nIt was Niels Bohr (1885 – 1962) who made certain modifications in\nthis model by adding the ideas of the newly developing quantum\nhypothesis. Niels Bohr studied in Rutherford’s laboratory for several\nmonths in 1912 and he was convinced about the validity of Rutherford\nnuclear model. Faced with the dilemma as discussed above, Bohr, in\n1913, concluded that in spite of the success of electromagnetic theory in\nexplaining large-scale phenomena, it could not be applied to the processes\nat the atomic scale. It became clear that a fairly radical departure from\nthe established principles of classical mechanics and electromagnetism\nwould be needed to understand the structure of atoms and the relation\nof atomic structure to atomic spectra. Bohr combined classical and early\nquantum concepts and gave his theory in the form of three postulates.\nThese are :\n\n(i) Bohr’s first postulate was that an electron in an atom could revolve\nin certain stable orbits without the emission of radiant energy,\ncontrary to the predictions of electromagnetic theory. According to\nthis postulate, each atom has certain definite stable states in which it\ncan exist, and each possible state has definite total energy. These are\ncalled the stationary states of the atom.\n\n(ii) Bohr’s second postulate defines these stable orbits. This postulate\nstates that the electron revolves around the nucleus only in those\norbits for which the angular momentum is some integral multiple of\n\nh/2π where h is the Planck’s constant (= 6.6 × 10–34 J s). Thus the\nangular momentum (L) of the orbiting electron is quantised. That is\n\nL = nh/2π (12.11)\n\n(iii) Bohr’s third postulate incorporated into atomic theory the early\nquantum concepts that had been developed by Planck and Einstein.\nIt states that an electron might make a transition from one of its\nspecified non-radiating orbits to another of lower energy. When it\n\ndoes so, a photon is emitted having energy equal to the energy\n\ndifference between the initial and final states. The frequency of the\nemitted photon is then given by\n\nhν  =   E\ni\n – E\n\nf\n(12.12)\n\nwhere E\ni\n and E\n\nf\n are the energies of the initial and final states and E\n\ni\n > E\n\nf\n.\n\nFor a hydrogen atom, Eq. (12.4) gives the expression to determine\nthe energies of different energy states. But then this equation requires\nthe radius r of the electron orbit. To calculate r, Bohr’s second postulate\nabout the angular momentum of the electron–the quantisation\ncondition – is used. The angular momentum L is given by\n\nL = mvr\n\nBohr’s second postulate of quantisation [Eq. (12.11)] says that the\nallowed values of angular momentum are integral multiples of h/2π.\n\nL\nn \n=\n\n \n mv\n\nn\nr\n\nn\n  = \n\n2\nnh\n\nπ\n(12.13)\n\nwhere n is an integer, r\nn\n is the radius of nth possible orbit and v\n\nn \nis the\n\nspeed of moving electron in the nth orbit. The allowed orbits are numbered\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n425\n\nAtoms\n\n1, 2, 3 ..., according to the values of n, which is called the principal\nquantum number of the orbit.\n\nFrom Eq.

(12.14) depicts that the orbital speed in the nth orbit falls by a factor\nof n. Using Eq.

(12.15), it can also be seen that the radii of the orbits increase as n2.\nThe total energy of the electron in the stationary states of the hydrogen\n\natom can be obtained by substituting the value of orbital radius in\nEq.

Energy will thus be\nrequired to remove the electron from the hydrogen atom to a distance\ninfinitely far away from its nucleus (or proton in hydrogen atom).\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n426  E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n2\n.5\n\nThe derivation of Eqs. (12.17) – (12.19) involves the assumption that\nthe electronic orbits are circular, though orbits under inverse square\nforce are, in general elliptical. (Planets move in elliptical orbits under the\ninverse square gravitational force of the sun.)  However, it was shown by\nthe German physicist Arnold Sommerfeld (1868 – 1951) that, when the\nrestriction of circular orbit is relaxed, these equations continue to hold\neven for elliptic orbits.\n\nORBIT VS STATE (ORBITAL PICTURE) OF ELECTRON IN ATOM\n\nWe are introduced to the Bohr Model of atom one time or the other in the course of\nphysics. This model has its place in the history of quantum mechanics and particularly\nin explaining the structure of an atom. It has become a milestone since Bohr introduced\nthe revolutionary idea of definite energy orbits for the electrons, contrary to the classical\npicture requiring an accelerating particle to radiate. Bohr also introduced the idea of\nquantisation of angular momentum of electrons moving in definite orbits. Thus it was a\nsemi-classical picture of the structure of atom.\n\nNow with the development of quantum mechanics, we have a better understanding\nof the structure of atom. Solutions of the Schrödinger wave equation assign a wave-like\ndescription to the electrons bound in an atom due to attractive forces of the protons.\n\nAn orbit of the electron in the Bohr model is the circular path of motion of an electron\naround the nucleus. But according to quantum mechanics, we cannot associate a definite\npath with the motion of the electrons in an atom. We can only talk about the probability\nof finding an electron in a certain region of space around the nucleus. This probability\ncan be inferred from the one-electron wave function called the orbital. This function\ndepends only on the coordinates of the electron.\n\nIt is therefore essential that we understand the subtle differences that exist in the two\nmodels:\nl Bohr model is valid for only one-electron atoms/ions; an energy value, assigned to\n\neach orbit, depends on the principal quantum number n in this model. We know\nthat energy associated with a stationary state of an electron depends on n only, for\none-electron atoms/ions. For a multi-electron atom/ion, this is not true.\n\nl The solution of the Schrödinger wave equation, obtained for hydrogen-like atoms/\nions, called the wave function, gives information about the probability of finding an\nelectron in various regions around the nucleus. This orbital has no resemblance\nwhatsoever with the orbit defined for an electron in the Bohr model.\n\nExample 12.5 A 10 kg satellite circles earth once every 2 h in an\norbit having a radius of 8000 km. Assuming that Bohr’s angular\nmomentum postulate applies to satellites just as it does to an electron\nin the hydrogen atom, find the quantum number of the orbit of the\nsatellite.\n\nSolution\n\nFrom Eq. (12.13), we have\nm v\n\nn \nr\n\nn\n = nh/2π\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n427\n\nAtoms\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n2\n.5\n\nHere m = 10 kg and r\nn = 8 × 10\n\n6 m. We have the time period T of the\ncircling satellite as 2 h. That is T = 7200 s.\nThus the velocity v\n\nn\n = 2π r\n\nn\n/T.\n\nThe quantum number of the orbit of satellite\nn\n\n \n= (2π r\n\nn\n)2 × m/(T × h).\n\nSubstituting the values,\nn = (2π × 8 × 106 m)2 × 10/(7200 s × 6.64 × 10–34 J s)\n   = 5.3 × 1045\n\nNote that the quantum number for the satellite motion is extremely\nlarge! In fact for such large quantum numbers the results of\nquantisation conditions tend to those of classical physics.\n\n12.4.1  Energy levels\n\nThe energy of an atom is the least (largest negative value)\nwhen its electron is revolving in an orbit closest to the\nnucleus i.e., the one for which n = 1. For n = 2, 3, ... the\nabsolute value of the energy E is smaller, hence the energy\nis progressively larger in the outer orbits. The lowest state\nof the atom, called the ground state, is that of the lowest\nenergy, with the electron revolving in the orbit of smallest\nradius, the Bohr radius, a\n\n0\n. The energy of this state (n = 1),\n\nE1 is –13.6 eV. Therefore, the minimum energy required to\nfree the electron from the ground state of the hydrogen atom\nis 13.6 eV. It is called the ionisation energy of the hydrogen\natom. This prediction of the Bohr’s model is in excellent\nagreement with the experimental value of ionisation energy.\n\nAt room temperature, most of the hydrogen atoms are\nin ground state. When a hydrogen atom receives energy\nby processes such as electron collisions, the atom may\nacquire sufficient energy to raise the electron to higher\nenergy states. The atom is then said to be in an excited\nstate. From Eq. (12.19), for n = 2; the energy E\n\n2\n is\n\n–3.40 eV. It means that the energy required to excite an\nelectron in hydrogen atom to its first excited state, is an\nenergy equal to E\n\n2\n – E\n\n1\n = –3.40 eV – (–13.6) eV = 10.2 eV.\n\nSimilarly, E\n3\n = –1.51 eV and E\n\n3\n – E\n\n1\n = 12.09 eV, or to excite\n\nthe hydrogen atom from its ground state (n = 1) to second\nexcited state (n = 3), 12.09 eV energy is required, and so\non. From these excited states the electron can then fall back\nto a state of lower energy, emitting a photon in the process.\nThus, as the excitation of hydrogen atom increases (that is\nas n increases) the value of minimum energy required to\nfree the electron from the excited atom decreases.\n\nThe energy level diagram* for the stationary states of a\nhydrogen atom, computed from Eq. (12.19), is given in\n\n* An electron can have any total energy above E = 0 eV. In such situations the\nelectron is free. Thus there is a continuum of energy states above E = 0 eV, as\nshown in Fig. 12.8.\n\nFIGURE 12.8 The energy level\ndiagram for the hydrogen atom.\nThe electron in a hydrogen atom\n\nat room temperature spends\nmost of its time in the ground\n\nstate. To ionise a hydrogen\natom an electron from the\n\nground state, 13.6 eV of energy\nmust be supplied. (The horizontal\n\nlines specify the presence of\nallowed energy states.)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n428\n\nFig. 12.8. The principal quantum number n labels the stationary\nstates in the ascending order of energy. In this diagram, the highest\nenergy state corresponds to n =∞ in Eq, (12.19) and has an energy\nof 0 eV. This is the energy of the atom when the electron is\ncompletely removed (r = ∞) from the nucleus and is at rest. Observe how\nthe energies of the excited states come closer and closer together as n\nincreases.\n\n12.5  THE LINE SPECTRA OF THE HYDROGEN ATOM\nAccording to the third postulate of Bohr’s model, when an atom makes a\ntransition from the higher energy state with quantum number n\n\ni\n to the\n\nlower energy state with quantum number n\nf\n (n\n\nf\n < n\n\ni\n), the difference of\n\nenergy is carried away by a photon of frequency ν\nif\n such that\n\nFRANCK – HERTZ EXPERIMENT\n\nThe existence of discrete energy levels in an atom was directly verified in 1914 by James\nFranck and Gustav Hertz. They studied the spectrum of mercury vapour when electrons\nhaving different kinetic energies passed through the vapour. The electron energy was\nvaried by subjecting the electrons to electric fields of varying strength. The electrons\ncollide with the mercury atoms and can transfer energy to the mercury atoms. This can\nonly happen when the energy of the electron is higher than the energy difference between\nan energy level of Hg occupied by an electron and a higher unoccupied level (see Figure).\nFor instance, the difference between an occupied energy level of Hg and a higher\nunoccupied level is 4.9 eV. If an electron of having an energy of 4.9 eV or more passes\nthrough mercury, an electron in mercury atom can absorb energy from the bombarding\nelectron and get excited to the higher level [Fig (a)]. The colliding electron’s kinetic energy\nwould reduce by this amount.\n\nThe excited electron would subsequently fall back to the ground state by emission of\nradiation [Fig. (b)]. The wavelength of emitted radiation is:\n\n34 8\n\n19\n\n6.625 10 3 10\n4.9 1.6 10\n\nhc\n\nE\nλ\n\n−\n\n−\n\n× × ×\n= =\n\n× ×\n = 253 nm\n\nBy direct measurement, Franck and Hertz found that the emission spectrum of\nmercury has a line corresponding to this wavelength. For this experimental verification\nof Bohr’s basic ideas of discrete energy levels in atoms and the process of photon emission,\nFrank and Hertz were awarded the Nobel prize in 1925.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n429\n\nAtoms\n\nhν\nif\n =  Eni – Enf (12.20)\n\nUsing Eq.

In this relation, if we take n\n\nf\n = 2 and n\n\ni\n = 3, 4, 5..., it\n\nreduces to a form similar to Eq. (12.10) for the Balmer series. The Rydberg\nconstant R is readily identified to be\n\nR =\n4\n\n2 38\nme\n\nh c0ε\n(12.23)\n\nIf we insert the values of various constants in Eq. (12.23), we get\nR  = 1.03 × 107 m–1\n\nThis is a value very close to the value (1.097 × 107 m–1) obtained from the\nempirical Balmer formula. This agreement between the theoretical and\nexperimental values of the Rydberg constant provided a direct and\nstriking confirmation of the Bohr’s model.\n\nSince both n\nf\n and n\n\ni\n are integers,\n\nthis immediately shows that  in\ntransitions between different atomic\nlevels, light is radiated in various\ndiscrete frequencies. For hydrogen\nspectrum, the Balmer formula\ncorresponds to n\n\nf\n = 2 and n\n\ni\n = 3, 4, 5,\n\netc. The results of the Bohr’s model\nsuggested the presence of other series\nspectra for hydrogen atom–those\ncorresponding to transitions resulting\nfrom n\n\nf\n = 1 and n\n\ni\n = 2, 3, etc.; n\n\nf\n = 3\n\nand n\ni\n = 4, 5, etc., and so on. Such\n\nseries were identified in the course of\nspectroscopic investigations and are\nknown as the Lyman, Balmer,\nPaschen, Brackett, and Pfund series.\nThe electronic transitions\ncorresponding to these series are\nshown in Fig. 12.9.\n\nThe various lines in the atomic\nspectra are produced when electrons\njump from higher energy state to a\nlower energy state and photons are\nemitted. These spectral lines are called\nemission lines. But when an atom\nabsorbs a photon that has precisely\n\nFIGURE 12.9 Line spectra originate in\ntransitions between energy levels.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n430\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n2\n.6\n\nthe same energy needed by the electron in a lower energy state to make\ntransitions to a higher energy state, the process is called absorption.\nThus if photons with a continuous range of frequencies pass through a\nrarefied gas and then are analysed with a spectrometer, a series of dark\nspectral absorption lines appear in the continuous spectrum. The dark\nlines indicate the frequencies that have been absorbed by the atoms of\nthe gas.\n\nThe explanation of the hydrogen atom spectrum provided by Bohr’s\nmodel was a brilliant achievement, which greatly stimulated progress\ntowards the modern quantum theory. In 1922, Bohr was awarded Nobel\nPrize in Physics.\n\nExample 12.6 Using the Rydberg formula, calculate the wavelengths\nof the first four spectral lines in the Lyman series of the hydrogen\nspectrum.\n\nSolution The Rydberg formula is\n\nhc/λ\nif\n  = \n\n4\n\n2 2 2 2\n\n1 1\n8 f i\n\nme\n\nh n n0ε\n\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n−\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\n\uf8ed \uf8f8\n\nThe wavelengths of the first four lines in the Lyman series correspond\nto transitions from n\n\ni\n = 2,3,4,5 to n\n\nf\n = 1.

It states that the angular\nmomentum of the electron orbiting around the nucleus is quantised (that\nis, L\n\nn\n = nh/2π; n  = 1, 2, 3 …). Why should the angular momentum have\n\nonly those values that are integral multiples of h/2π? The French physicist\nLouis de Broglie explained this puzzle in 1923, ten years after Bohr\nproposed his model.\n\nWe studied, in Chapter 11, about the de Broglie’s hypothesis that\nmaterial particles, such as electrons, also have a wave nature. C. J. Davisson\nand L. H. Germer later experimentally verified the wave nature of electrons\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n431\n\nAtoms\n\nin 1927. Louis de Broglie argued that the electron in its\ncircular orbit, as proposed by Bohr, must be seen as a particle\nwave. In analogy to waves travelling on a string, particle waves\ntoo can lead to standing waves under resonant conditions.\nFrom Chapter 15 of Class XI Physics  textbook, we know that\nwhen a string is plucked, a vast number of wavelengths are\nexcited. However only those wavelengths survive which have\nnodes at the ends and form the standing wave in the string. It\nmeans that in a string, standing waves are formed when the\ntotal distance travelled by a wave down the string and back is\none wavelength, two wavelengths, or any integral number of\nwavelengths. Waves with other wavelengths interfere with\nthemselves upon reflection and their amplitudes quickly drop\nto zero. For an electron moving in nth circular orbit of radius\nr\n\nn\n, the total distance is the circumference of the orbit, 2πr\n\nn\n.\n\nThus\n\n2π r\nn\n = nλ,      n = 1, 2, 3... (12.24)\n\nFigure 12.10 illustrates a standing particle wave on a\ncircular orbit for n = 4, i.e., 2πr\n\nn\n = 4λ, where λ is the de Broglie\n\nwavelength of the electron moving in nth orbit. From Chapter\n11, we have λ = h/p, where p is the magnitude of the electron’s\nmomentum. If the speed of the electron is much less than the speed of\nlight, the momentum is mv\n\nn\n. Thus, λ = h/mv\n\nn\n. From Eq. (12.24), we have\n\n2π r\nn\n =  n h/mv\n\nn\n      or     m v\n\nn \nr\n\nn  \n=  nh/2π\n\nThis is the quantum condition proposed by Bohr for the angular\nmomentum of the electron [Eq. (12.13)]. In Section 12.5, we saw that\nthis equation is the basis of explaining the discrete orbits and energy\nlevels in hydrogen atom. Thus de Broglie hypothesis provided an\nexplanation for Bohr’s second postulate for the quantisation of angular\nmomentum of the orbiting electron. The quantised electron orbits and\nenergy states are due to the wave nature of the electron and only resonant\nstanding waves can persist.\n\nBohr’s model, involving classical trajectory picture (planet-like electron\norbiting the nucleus), correctly predicts the gross features of the\nhydrogenic atoms*, in particular, the frequencies of the radiation emitted\nor selectively absorbed. This model however has many limitations.\nSome are:\n(i) The Bohr model is applicable to hydrogenic atoms. It cannot be\n\nextended even to mere two electron atoms such as helium. The analysis\nof atoms with more than one electron was attempted on the lines of\nBohr’s model for hydrogenic atoms but did not meet with any success.\nDifficulty lies in the fact that each electron interacts not only with the\npositively charged nucleus but also with all other electrons.\n\nFIGURE 12.10 A standing\nwave is shown on a circular\norbit where four de Broglie\n\nwavelengths fit into the\ncircumference of the orbit.\n\n* Hydrogenic atoms are the atoms consisting of a nucleus with positive charge\n+Ze and a single electron, where Z is the proton number. Examples are hydrogen\natom, singly ionised helium, doubly ionised lithium, and so forth. In these\natoms more complex electron-electron interactions are nonexistent.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n432\n\nThe formulation of Bohr model involves electrical force between\npositively charged nucleus and electron. It does not include the\nelectrical forces between electrons which necessarily appear in\nmulti-electron atoms.\n\n(ii) While the Bohr’s model correctly predicts the frequencies of the light\nemitted by hydrogenic atoms, the model is unable to explain the\nrelative intensities of the frequencies in the spectrum. In emission\nspectrum of hydrogen, some of the visible frequencies have weak\nintensity, others strong. Why? Experimental observations depict that\nsome transitions are more favoured than others. Bohr’s model is\nunable to account for the intensity variations.\n\nBohr’s model presents an elegant picture of an atom and cannot be\ngeneralised to complex atoms. For complex atoms we have to use a new\nand radical theory based on Quantum Mechanics, which provides a more\ncomplete picture of the atomic structure.\n\nLASER LIGHT\n\nImagine a crowded market place or a railway platform with people entering a gate and\ngoing towards all directions. Their footsteps are random and there is no phase correlation\nbetween them. On the other hand, think of a large number of soldiers in a regulated march.\nTheir footsteps are very well correlated. See figure here.\n\nThis is similar to the difference between light emitted by\nan ordinary source like a candle or a bulb and that emitted\nby a laser. The acronym LASER stands for Light Amplification\nby Stimulated Emission of Radiation. Since its development\nin 1960, it has entered into all areas of science and technology.\nIt has found applications in physics, chemistry, biology,\nmedicine, surgery, engineering, etc. There are low power\nlasers, with a power of 0.5 mW, called pencil lasers, which\nserve as pointers. There are also lasers of different power,\nsuitable for delicate surgery of eye or glands in the stomach.\nFinally, there are lasers which can cut or weld steel.\n\nLight is emitted from a source in the form of packets of\nwaves. Light coming out from an ordinary source contains a mixture of many wavelengths.\nThere is also no phase relation between the various waves. Therefore, such light, even if it is\npassed through an aperture, spreads very fast and the beam size increases rapidly with\ndistance. In the case of laser light, the wavelength of each packet is almost the same. Also\nthe average length of the packet of waves is much larger. This means that there is better\nphase correlation over a longer duration of time. This results in reducing the divergence of\na laser beam substantially.\n\nIf there are N atoms in a source, each emitting light with intensity I, then the total\nintensity produced by an ordinary source is proportional to NI, whereas in a laser source,\nit is proportional to N2I. Considering that N is very large, we see that the light from a laser\ncan be much stronger than that from an ordinary source.\n\nWhen astronauts of the Apollo missions visited the moon, they placed a mirror on its\nsurface, facing the earth. Then scientists on the earth sent a strong laser beam, which was\nreflected by the mirror on the moon and received back on the earth. The size of the reflected\nlaser beam and the time taken for the round trip were measured. This allowed a very\naccurate determination of (a) the extremely small divergence of a laser beam and (b) the\ndistance of the moon from the earth.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n433\n\nAtoms\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. Atom, as a whole, is electrically neutral and therefore contains equal\namount of positive and negative charges.\n\n2. In Thomson’s model, an atom is a spherical cloud of positive charges\nwith electrons embedded in it.\n\n3. In Rutherford’s model, most of the mass of the atom and all its positive\ncharge are concentrated in a tiny nucleus (typically one by ten thousand\nthe size of an atom), and the electrons revolve around it.\n\n4. Rutherford nuclear model has two main difficulties in explaining the\nstructure of atom: (a) It predicts that atoms are unstable because the\naccelerated electrons revolving around the nucleus must spiral into\nthe nucleus. This contradicts the stability of matter. (b) It cannot\nexplain the characteristic line spectra of atoms of different elements.\n\n5. Atoms of most of the elements are stable and emit characteristic\nspectrum. The spectrum consists of a set of isolated parallel lines\ntermed as line spectrum. It provides useful information about the\natomic structure.\n\n6. The atomic hydrogen emits a line spectrum consisting of various series.\nThe frequency of any line in a series can be expressed as a difference\nof two terms;\n\nLyman series: ν = −\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\nRc\n\nn\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n2 2\n\n; n = 2, 3, 4,...\n\nBalmer series: ν = −\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f7Rc\n\nn\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n2 2\n\n; n = 3, 4, 5,...\n\nPaschen series: ν = −\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\nRc\n\nn\n\n1\n\n3\n\n1\n2 2\n\n; n = 4, 5, 6,...\n\nBrackett series: ν = −\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\nRc\n\nn\n\n1\n\n4\n\n1\n2 2\n\n; n = 5, 6, 7,...\n\nPfund series: ν = −\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f7Rc\n\nn\n\n1\n\n5\n\n1\n2 2\n\n; n = 6, 7, 8,...\n\n7. To explain the line spectra emitted by atoms, as well as the stability\nof atoms, Niel’s Bohr proposed a model for hydrogenic (single elctron)\natoms. He introduced three postulates and laid the foundations of\nquantum mechanics:\n(a) In a hydrogen atom, an electron revolves in certain stable orbits\n\n(called stationary orbits) without the emission of radiant energy.\n(b) The stationary orbits are those for which the angular momentum\n\nis some integral multiple of h/2π. (Bohr’s quantisation condition.)\nThat is L = nh/2π, where n is an integer called the principal\nquantum number.\n\n(c) The third postulate states that an electron might make a transition\nfrom one of its specified non-radiating orbits to another of lower\nenergy. When it does so, a photon is emitted having energy equal\nto the energy difference between the initial and final states. The\nfrequency (ν) of the emitted photon is then given by\nhν  = E\n\ni\n – E\n\nf\n\nAn atom absorbs radiation of the same frequency the atom emits,\nin which case the electron is transferred to an orbit with a higher\nvalue of n.\n\nE\ni\n + hν  =  E\n\nf\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n434\n\n8. As a result of the quantisation condition of angular momentum, the\nelectron orbits the nucleus at only specific radii. For a hydrogen atom\nit is given by\n\n22\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n2n\n\nn h\nr\n\nm e\n\nε\uf8eb \uf8f6 π\uf8eb \uf8f6\n= \uf8ec \uf8f7\uf8ec \uf8f7 \uf8ed \uf8f8π\uf8ed \uf8f8\n\nThe total energy is also quantised:\n\n4\n\n2 2 2\n08\n\nn\n\nme\nE\n\nn hε\n= −\n\n     = –13.6 eV/n2\n\nThe n = 1 state is called ground state. In hydrogen atom the ground\nstate energy is  –13.6 eV. Higher values of n correspond to excited\nstates (n > 1). Atoms are excited to these higher states by collisions\nwith other atoms or electrons or by absorption of a photon of right\nfrequency.\n\n9. de Broglie’s hypothesis that electrons have a wavelength λ = h/mv gave\nan explanation for Bohr’s quantised orbits by bringing in the wave-\nparticle duality. The orbits correspond to circular standing waves in\nwhich the circumference of the orbit equals a whole number of\nwavelengths.\n\n10. Bohr’s model is applicable only to hydrogenic (single electron) atoms.\nIt cannot be extended to even two electron atoms such as helium.\nThis model is also unable to explain for the relative intensities of the\nfrequencies emitted even by hydrogenic atoms.\n\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n\n1. Both the Thomson’s as well as the Rutherford’s models constitute an\nunstable system. Thomson’s model is unstable electrostatically, while\nRutherford’s model is unstable because of electromagnetic radiation\nof orbiting electrons.\n\n2. What made Bohr quantise angular momentum (second postulate) and\nnot some other quantity? Note, h has dimensions of angular\nmomentum, and for circular orbits, angular momentum is a very\nrelevant quantity. The second postulate is then so natural!\n\n3. The orbital picture in Bohr’s model of the hydrogen atom was\ninconsistent with the uncertainty principle. It was replaced by modern\nquantum mechanics in which Bohr’s orbits are regions where the\nelectron may be found with large probability.\n\n4. Unlike the situation in the solar system, where planet-planet\ngravitational forces are very small as compared to the gravitational\nforce of the sun on each planet (because the mass of the sun is so\nmuch greater than the mass of any of the planets), the electron-electron\nelectric force interaction is comparable in magnitude to the electron-\nnucleus electrical force, because the charges and distances are of the\nsame order of magnitude. This is the reason why the Bohr’s model\nwith its planet-like electron is not applicable to many electron atoms.\n\n5. Bohr laid the foundation of the quantum theory by postulating specific\norbits in which electrons do not radiate. Bohr’s model include only\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n435\n\nAtoms\n\none quantum number n. The new theory called quantum mechanics\nsupportes Bohr’s postulate. However in quantum mechanics (more\ngenerally accepted), a given energy level may not correspond to just\none quantum state. For example, a state is characterised by four\nquantum numbers (n, l, m, and s), but for a pure Coulomb potential\n(as in hydrogen atom) the energy depends only on n.\n\n6. In Bohr model, contrary to ordinary classical expectation, the\nfrequency of revolution of an electron in its orbit is not connected to\nthe frequency of spectral line. The later is the difference between two\norbital energies divided by h. For transitions between large quantum\nnumbers (n to n – 1, n very large), however, the two coincide as expected.\n\n7. Bohr’s semiclassical model based on some aspects of classical physics\nand some aspects of modern physics also does not provide a true\npicture of the simplest hydrogenic atoms. The true picture is quantum\nmechanical affair which differs from Bohr model in a number of\nfundamental ways. But then if the Bohr model is not strictly correct,\nwhy do we bother about it? The reasons which make Bohr’s model\nstill useful are:\n\n(i) The model is based on just three postulates but accounts for almost\nall the general features of the hydrogen spectrum.\n\n(ii) The model incorporates many of the concepts we have learnt in\nclassical physics.\n\n(iii) The model demonstrates how a theoretical physicist occasionally\nmust quite literally ignore certain problems of approach in hopes\nof being able to make some predictions. If the predictions of the\ntheory or model agree with experiment, a theoretician then must\nsomehow hope to explain away or rationalise the problems that\nwere ignored along the way.\n\nEXERCISES\n\n12.1 Choose the correct alternative from the clues given at the end of\nthe each statement:\n\n(a) The size of the atom in Thomson’s model is .......... the atomic\nsize in Rutherford’s model.

Then what determines the typical atomic size? Why is an\natom not, say, thousand times bigger than its typical size? The\nquestion had greatly puzzled Bohr before he arrived at his famous\nmodel of the atom that you have learnt in the text. To simulate what\nhe might well have done before his discovery, let us play as follows\nwith the basic constants of nature and see if we can get a quantity\nwith the dimensions of length that is roughly equal to the known\nsize of an atom (~ 10–10m).\n\n(a) Construct a quantity with the dimensions of length from the\nfundamental constants e, m\n\ne\n, and c. Determine its numerical\n\nvalue.\n\n(b) You will find that the length obtained in (a) is many orders of\nmagnitude smaller than the atomic dimensions. Further, it\ninvolves c. But energies of atoms are mostly in non-relativistic\ndomain where c is not expected to play any role. This is what\nmay have suggested Bohr to discard c and look for ‘something\nelse’ to get the right atomic size. Now, the Planck’s constant h\nhad already made its appearance elsewhere. Bohr’s great insight\nlay in recognising that h, m\n\ne\n, and e will yield the right atomic\n\nsize. Construct a quantity with the dimension of length from h,\nme, and e and confirm that its numerical value has indeed the\ncorrect order of magnitude.\n\n12.15 The total energy of an electron in the first excited state of the\nhydrogen atom is about –3.4 eV.\n\n(a) What is the kinetic energy of the electron in this state?\n\n(b) What is the potential energy of the electron in this state?\n\n(c) Which of the answers above would change if the choice of the\nzero of potential energy is changed?\n\n12.16 If Bohr’s quantisation postulate (angular momentum = nh/2π) is a\nbasic law of nature, it should be equally valid for the case of planetary\nmotion also. Why then do we never speak of quantisation of orbits\nof planets around the sun?\n\n12.17 Obtain the first Bohr’s radius and the ground state energy of a\nmuonic hydrogen atom [i.e., an atom in which a negatively charged\nmuon (µ–) of mass about 207m\n\ne\n orbits around a proton].\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 13.pmd\n\n\nPhysics\n\n438\n\n13.1  INTRODUCTION\nIn the previous chapter, we have learnt that in every atom, the positive\n\ncharge and mass are densely concentrated at the centre of the atom\n\nforming its nucleus. The overall dimensions of a nucleus are much smaller\n\nthan those of an atom. Experiments on scattering of α-particles\ndemonstrated that the radius of a nucleus was smaller than the radius\n\nof an atom by a factor of about 104. This means the volume of a nucleus\n\nis about 10\n–12\n\n times the volume of the atom. In other words, an atom is\n\nalmost empty. If an atom is enlarged to the size of a classroom, the nucleus\n\nwould be of the size of pinhead. Nevertheless, the nucleus contains most\n\n(more than 99.9%) of the mass of an atom.\n\nDoes the nucleus have a structure, just as the atom does?  If so, what\n\nare the constituents of the nucleus?  How are these held together? In this\n\nchapter, we shall look for answers to such questions. We shall discuss\n\nvarious properties of nuclei such as their size, mass and stability, and\n\nalso associated nuclear phenomena such as radioactivity, fission and fusion.\n\n13.2  ATOMIC MASSES AND COMPOSITION OF NUCLEUS\nThe mass of an atom is very small, compared to a kilogram;  for example,\n\nthe mass of a carbon atom, \n12\n\nC, is 1.992647 × 10\n–26 \n\nkg. Kilogram is not\na very convenient unit to measure such small quantities. Therefore, a\n\nChapter Thirteen\n\nNUCLEI\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n439\n\nNuclei\n\ndifferent mass unit is used for expressing atomic masses. This unit is the\natomic mass unit (u), defined as 1/12\n\nth\n of the mass of the carbon (\n\n12\nC)\n\natom. According to this definition\n\n12\n mass of one C atom\n\n1u = \n12\n\n     \n261.992647 10 kg\n\n12\n\n−\n×\n\n=\n\n     271.660539 10 kg\n−\n\n= × (13.1)\n\nThe atomic masses of various elements expressed in atomic mass\n\nunit (u) are close to being integral multiples of the mass of a hydrogen\natom. There are, however, many striking exceptions to this rule. For\nexample, the atomic mass of chlorine atom is 35.46 u.\n\nAccurate measurement of atomic masses is carried out with a mass\nspectrometer, The measurement of atomic masses reveals the existence\nof different types of atoms of the same element, which exhibit the same\n\nchemical properties, but differ in mass. Such atomic species of the same\nelement differing in mass are called isotopes. (In Greek, isotope means\nthe same place, i.e. they occur in the same place in the periodic table of\n\nelements.) It was found that practically every element consists of a mixture\nof several isotopes.  The relative abundance of different isotopes differs\nfrom element to element. Chlorine, for example, has two isotopes having\n\nmasses 34.98 u and 36.98 u, which are nearly integral multiples of the\nmass of a hydrogen atom.  The relative abundances of these isotopes are\n75.4 and 24.6 per cent, respectively.  Thus, the average mass of a chlorine\n\natom is obtained by the weighted average of the masses of the two\nisotopes,  which works out to be\n\n= \n75.4 34.98 24.6 36.98\n\n100\n\n× + ×\n\n=  35.47 u\nwhich agrees with the atomic mass of chlorine.\n\nEven the lightest element, hydrogen has three isotopes having masses\n\n1.0078 u, 2.0141 u, and 3.0160 u.  The nucleus of the lightest atom of\nhydrogen, which has a relative abundance of 99.985%, is called the\nproton.  The mass of a proton is\n\n27\n1.00727 u 1.67262 10 kgpm\n\n−\n= = × (13.2)\n\nThis is equal to the mass of the hydrogen atom (= 1.00783u), minus\n\nthe mass of a single electron (m\ne \n= 0.00055 u).  The other two isotopes of\n\nhydrogen are called deuterium and tritium. Tritium nuclei, being\nunstable, do not occur naturally and are produced artificially in\n\nlaboratories.\nThe positive charge in the nucleus is that of the protons. A proton\n\ncarries one unit of fundamental charge and is stable. It was earlier thought\n\nthat the nucleus may contain electrons, but this was ruled out later using\narguments based on quantum theory. All the electrons of an atom are\noutside the nucleus. We know that the number of these electrons outside\n\nthe nucleus of the atom is Z, the atomic number. The total charge of the\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n440\n\natomic electrons is thus (–Ze), and since the atom is neutral, the charge\nof the nucleus is (+Ze). The number of protons in the nucleus of the atom\nis, therefore, exactly Z, the atomic number.\n\nDiscovery of Neutron\n\nSince the nuclei of deuterium and tritium are isotopes of hydrogen, they\nmust contain only one proton each.  But the masses of the nuclei of\n\nhydrogen, deuterium and tritium are in the ratio of 1:2:3.  Therefore, the\nnuclei of deuterium and tritium must contain,  in addition to a proton,\nsome neutral matter.  The amount of neutral matter present in the nuclei\n\nof these isotopes, expressed in units of mass of a proton, is approximately\nequal to one and two, respectively.  This fact indicates that the nuclei of\natoms contain, in addition to protons, neutral matter in multiples of a\n\nbasic unit.  This hypothesis was verified in 1932 by James Chadwick\nwho observed emission of neutral radiation when beryllium nuclei were\n\nbombarded with alpha-particles (α-particles are helium nuclei, to be\ndiscussed in a later section). It was found that this neutral radiation\ncould knock out protons from light nuclei such as those of helium, carbon\n\nand nitrogen. The only neutral radiation known at that time was photons\n(electromagnetic radiation). Application of the principles of conservation\nof energy and momentum showed that if the neutral radiation consisted\n\nof photons, the energy of photons would have to be much higher than is\n\navailable from the bombardment of beryllium nuclei with α-particles.\nThe clue to this puzzle, which Chadwick satisfactorily solved, was to\nassume that the neutral radiation consists of a new type of neutral\nparticles called neutrons.  From conservation of energy and momentum,\n\nhe was able to determine the mass of new particle ‘as very nearly the\nsame as mass of proton’.\n\nThe mass of a neutron is now known to a high degree of accuracy. It is\n\nm\nn\n = 1.00866 u = 1.6749×10–27 kg (13.3)\n\nChadwick was awarded the 1935 Nobel Prize in Physics for his\ndiscovery of the neutron.\n\nA free neutron, unlike a free proton, is unstable.  It decays into a\nproton, an electron and a antineutrino (another elementary particle), and\nhas a mean life of about 1000s.  It is, however, stable inside the nucleus.\n\nThe composition of a nucleus can now be described using the following\nterms and symbols:\n\nZ - atomic number = number of protons [13.4(a)]\n\nN - neutron number = number of neutrons [13.4(b)]\n\nA - mass number = Z + N\n\n                              = total number of protons and neutrons [13.4(c)]\n\nOne also uses the term nucleon for a proton or a neutron. Thus the\nnumber of nucleons in an atom is its mass number A.\n\nNuclear species or nuclides are shown by the notation X\nA\nZ\n\n where X is\n\nthe chemical symbol of the species.  For example, the nucleus of gold is\n\ndenoted by 197\n79 Au .  It contains 197 nucleons, of which 79 are protons\n\nand the rest118 are neutrons.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n441\n\nNuclei\n\nThe composition of isotopes of an element can now be readily\nexplained.  The nuclei of isotopes of a given element contain the same\nnumber of protons, but differ from each other in their number of neutrons.\n\nDeuterium, 2\n1 H , which is an isotope of hydrogen, contains one proton\n\nand one neutron.  Its other isotope tritium, 3\n1 H , contains one proton and\n\ntwo neutrons.  The element gold has 32 isotopes, ranging from A =173 to\n\nA = 204.  We have already mentioned that chemical properties of elements\ndepend on their electronic structure.  As the atoms of isotopes have\nidentical electronic structure they have identical chemical behaviour and\n\nare placed in the same location in the periodic table.\nAll nuclides with same mass number A are called isobars.  For\n\nexample, the nuclides 3\n1 H  and \n\n3\n2 He  are isobars.  Nuclides with same\n\nneutron number N but different atomic number Z, for example 198\n80 Hg\n\nand 197\n79 Au , are called isotones.\n\n13.3  SIZE OF THE NUCLEUS\nAs we have seen in Chapter 12, Rutherford was the pioneer who\n\npostulated and established the existence of the atomic nucleus. At\n\nRutherford’s suggestion, Geiger and Marsden performed their classic\n\nexperiment: on the scattering of α-particles from thin gold foils. Their\nexperiments revealed that the distance of closest approach to a gold\n\nnucleus of an α-particle of kinetic energy 5.5 MeV is about 4.0 × 10–14 m.\nThe scattering of α-particle by the gold sheet could be understood by\nRutherford by assuming that the coulomb repulsive force was solely\n\nresponsible for scattering. Since the positive charge is confined to the\n\nnucleus, the actual size of the nucleus has to be less than 4.0 × 10\n–14 \n\nm.\n\nIf we use α-particles of higher energies than 5.5 MeV, the distance of\n\nclosest approach to the gold nucleus will be smaller and at some point\n\nthe scattering will begin to be affected by the short range nuclear forces,\n\nand differ from Rutherford’s calculations. Rutherford’s calculations are\n\nbased on pure coulomb repulsion between the positive charges of the α-\n\nparticle and the gold nucleus. From the distance at which deviations set\n\nin, nuclear sizes can be inferred.\n\nBy performing scattering experiments in which fast electrons, instead\nof α-particles, are projectiles that bombard targets made up of various\nelements, the sizes of nuclei of various elements have been accurately\n\nmeasured.\nIt has been found that a nucleus of mass number A has a radius\n\nR = R\n0 \n\nA\n1/3\n\n(13.5)\n\nwhere R\n0\n = 1.2 × 10–15 m (=1.2 fm; 1 fm = 10–15 m). This means the volume\n\nof the nucleus, which is proportional to R\n3\n is proportional to A. Thus the\n\ndensity of nucleus is a constant, independent of A,  for all nuclei. Different\n\nnuclei are like a drop of liquid of constant density. The density of nuclear\n\nmatter is approximately 2.3 × 10\n17\n\n kg m\n–3\n\n. This density is very large\n\ncompared to ordinary matter, say water, which is 103 kg m–3. This is\n\nunderstandable, as we have already seen that most of the atom is empty.\n\nOrdinary matter consisting of atoms has a large amount of empty space.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n442\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n3\n.2\n\nExample 13.1 Given the mass of iron nucleus as 55.85u and A=56,\nfind the nuclear density?\n\nSolution\n\nm\nFe\n\n = 55.85,    u = 9.27 × 10\n–26\n\n  kg\n\nNuclear density = \nmass\n\nvolume\n = \n\n26\n\n15 3\n\n9.27 10 1\n\n56(4 /3)(1.2 10 )\n\n−\n\n−\n\n×\n×\n\nπ ×\n\n = 2.29 × 10\n17 \n\nkg m\n–3\n\nThe density of matter in neutron stars (an astrophysical object) is\ncomparable to this density. This shows that matter in these objects\n\nhas been compressed to such an extent that they resemble a big nucleus.\n\n13.4  MASS-ENERGY AND NUCLEAR BINDING ENERGY\n\n13.4.1  Mass – Energy\n\nEinstein showed from his theory of special relativity that it is necessary\n\nto treat mass as another form of energy. Before the advent of this theory\nof special relativity it was presumed  that mass and energy were conserved\nseparately in a reaction. However, Einstein showed that mass is another\n\nform of energy and one can convert mass-energy into other forms of\nenergy, say kinetic energy and vice-versa.\n\nEinstein gave the famous mass-energy equivalence relation\n\nE = mc\n2\n\n(13.6)\n\nHere the energy equivalent of mass m is related by the above equation\n\nand c is the velocity of light in vacuum and is approximately equal to\n3×10\n\n8\n m s\n\n–1\n.\n\nExample 13.2 Calculate the energy equivalent of 1 g of substance.\n\nSolution\n\nEnergy, E = 10\n–3 \n\n × ( 3 × 10\n8\n)\n2 \n\nJ\n\n     E = 10\n–3 \n\n× 9 × 10\n16 \n\n= 9 × 10\n13 \n\nJ\n\nThus, if one gram of matter is converted to energy, there is a release\n\nof enormous amount of energy.\n\nExperimental verification of the Einstein’s mass-energy relation has\n\nbeen achieved in the study of nuclear reactions amongst nucleons, nuclei,\n\nelectrons and other more recently discovered particles. In a reaction the\n\nconservation law of energy states that the initial energy and the final\n\nenergy are equal provided the energy associated with mass is also\n\nincluded. This concept is important in understanding nuclear masses\n\nand the interaction of nuclei with one another. They form the subject\n\nmatter of the next few sections.\n\n13.4.2  Nuclear binding energy\n\nIn Section 13.2 we have seen that the nucleus is made up of neutrons\nand protons.  Therefore it may be expected that the mass of the nucleus\n\nis equal to the total mass of its individual protons and neutrons.  However,\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n3\n.1\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n443\n\nNuclei\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n3\n.3\n\nthe nuclear mass M is found to be always less than this.  For example, let\n\nus consider 16\n8 O ; a nucleus which has 8 neutrons and 8 protons.  We\n\nhave\n\nMass of 8 neutrons = 8 × 1.00866 u\n\nMass of 8 protons   = 8 × 1.00727 u\n\nMass of 8 electrons = 8 × 0.00055 u\n\nTherefore the expected mass of 16\n8 O  nucleus\n\n= 8 × 2.01593 u = 16.12744 u.\n\nThe atomic mass of 16\n8 O  found from mass spectroscopy experiments\n\nis seen to be 15.99493 u. Substracting the mass of 8 electrons (8 × 0.00055 u)\n\nfrom this, we get the experimental mass of 16\n8 O  nucleus to be 15.99053 u.\n\nThus, we find that the mass of the 16\n8 O  nucleus is less than the total\n\nmass of its constituents by 0.13691u. The difference in mass of a nucleus\n\nand its constituents, ∆M, is called the mass defect, and is given by\n\n[ ( ) ]p nM Zm A Z m M∆ = + − − (13.7)\n\nWhat is the meaning of the mass defect? It is here that Einstein’s\nequivalence  of mass and energy plays a role. Since the mass of the oxygen\n\nnucleus is less that the sum of the masses of its constituents (8 protons\nand 8 neutrons, in the unbound state), the equivalent energy of the oxygen\nnucleus is less than that of the sum of the equivalent energies of its\n\nconstituents. If one wants to break the oxygen nucleus into 8 protons\n\nand 8 neutrons, this extra energy ∆M c2, has to supplied. This energy\nrequired E\n\nb\n is related to the mass defect by\n\nE\nb\n = ∆ M c2 (13.8)\n\nExample 13.3  Find the energy equivalent of one atomic mass unit,\nfirst in Joules and then in MeV.  Using this, express the mass defect\n\nof 16\n8 O  in MeV/c\n\n2\n.\n\nSolution\n1u = 1.6605 × 10\n\n–27\n kg\n\nTo convert it into energy units, we multiply it by c\n2 \n\nand find that\n\nenergy equivalent = 1.6605 × 10\n–27\n\n × (2.9979 × 10\n8\n)\n2\n kg m\n\n2\n/s\n\n2\n\n      = 1.4924 × 10\n–10\n\n J\n\n      =   \n\n10\n\n19\n\n1.4924 10\neV\n\n1.602 10\n\n−\n\n−\n\n×\n\n×\n\n      =   0.9315 × 10\n9\n eV\n\n      =   931.5 MeV\n\nor, 1u = 931.5 MeV/c\n2\n\nFor 16\n8 O ,   ∆M = 0.13691 u = 0.13691×931.5 MeV/c\n\n2\n\n= 127.5 MeV/c\n2\n\nThe energy needed to separate 16\n8 O  into its constituents is thus\n\n127.5 MeV/c\n2\n.\n\nIf a certain number of neutrons and protons are brought together to\n\nform a nucleus of a certain charge and mass, an energy E\nb\n will be released\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n444\n\nin the process.  The energy E\nb\n is called the binding energy of the nucleus.\n\nIf we separate a nucleus into its nucleons, we would have to supply a\ntotal energy equal to E\n\nb\n, to those particles.  Although we cannot tear\n\napart a nucleus in this way, the nuclear binding energy is still a convenient\nmeasure of how well a nucleus is held together.  A more useful measure\nof the binding between the constituents of the nucleus is the binding\n\nenergy per nucleon, E\nbn\n\n, which is the ratio of the binding energy E\nb\n of a\n\nnucleus to the number of the nucleons, A, in that nucleus:\n\nE\nbn  \n\n =  E\nb\n / A (13.9)\n\nWe can think of binding energy per nucleon as the average energy\nper nucleon needed to separate a nucleus into its individual nucleons.\n\nFigure 13.1 is a plot of the\n\nbinding energy per nucleon E\nbn\n\nversus the mass number A for a\nlarge number of nuclei. We notice\n\nthe following main features of\nthe plot:\n(i) the binding energy per\n\nnucleon, E\nbn\n\n, is practically\nconstant, i.e. practically\nindependent of the atomic\nnumber for nuclei of middle\n\nmass number ( 30 < A < 170).\nThe curve has a maximum of\nabout 8.75 MeV for A = 56\n\nand has a value of 7.6 MeV\nfor A = 238.\n\n(ii) E\nbn\n\n is lower for both light\n\nnuclei (A<30) and heavy\nnuclei (A>170).\n\nWe can draw some conclusions from these two observations:\n\n(i) The force is attractive and sufficiently strong to produce a binding\nenergy of a few MeV per nucleon.\n\n(ii) The constancy of the binding energy in the range 30 < A < 170 is a\n\nconsequence of the fact that the nuclear force is short-ranged. Consider\na particular nucleon inside a sufficiently large nucleus. It will be under\nthe influence of only some of its neighbours, which come within the\n\nrange of the nuclear force. If any other nucleon is at a distance more\nthan the range of the nuclear force from the particular nucleon it will\nhave no influence on the binding energy of the nucleon under\n\nconsideration. If a nucleon can have a maximum of p neighbours\nwithin the range of nuclear force, its binding energy would be\nproportional to p. Let the binding energy of the nucleus be pk, where\n\nk is a constant having the dimensions of energy. If we increase A by\nadding nucleons they will not change the binding energy of a nucleon\ninside. Since most of the nucleons in a large nucleus reside inside it\n\nand not on the surface, the change in binding energy per nucleon\nwould be small. The binding energy per nucleon is a constant and is\napproximately equal to pk. The property that a given nucleon\n\nFIGURE 13.1 The binding energy per nucleon\nas a function of mass number.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n445\n\nNuclei\n\ninfluences only nucleons close to it is also referred to as saturation\nproperty of the nuclear force.\n\n(iii) A very heavy nucleus, say A = 240, has lower binding energy per\n\nnucleon compared to that of a  nucleus with A = 120. Thus if a\nnucleus A = 240 breaks into two A = 120 nuclei, nucleons get more\ntightly bound. This implies energy would be released in the process.\n\nIt has very important implications for energy production through\nfission, to be discussed later in Section 13.7.1.\n\n(iv) Consider two very light nuclei (A ≤ 10) joining to form a heavier\n\nnucleus. The binding energy  per nucleon of the fused heavier nuclei\nis more than the binding energy per nucleon of the lighter nuclei.\nThis means that the final system is more tightly bound than the initial\n\nsystem. Again energy would be released in such a process of\nfusion. This is the energy source of sun, to be discussed later in\nSection 13.7.3.\n\n13.5  NUCLEAR FORCE\nThe force that determines the motion of atomic electrons is the familiar\n\nCoulomb force. In Section 13.4,  we have seen that for average mass\n\nnuclei the binding energy per nucleon is  approximately 8 MeV, which is\n\nmuch larger than the binding energy in atoms. Therefore, to bind a\n\nnucleus together there must be a strong attractive force of a totally\n\ndifferent kind. It must be strong enough to overcome the repulsion\n\nbetween the (positively charged) protons and to bind both protons and\n\nneutrons into the tiny nuclear volume. We have already seen\n\nthat the constancy of binding energy per nucleon can be\n\nunderstood in terms of its short-range. Many features of the\n\nnuclear binding force are summarised below. These are\n\nobtained from a variety of experiments carried out during 1930\n\nto 1950.\n\n(i) The nuclear force is much stronger than the Coulomb force\n\nacting between charges or the gravitational forces between\n\nmasses. The nuclear binding force has to dominate over\n\nthe Coulomb repulsive force between protons inside the\n\nnucleus. This happens only because the nuclear force is\n\nmuch stronger than the coulomb force. The gravitational\n\nforce is much weaker  than even Coulomb force.\n\n(ii) The nuclear force between two nucleons falls rapidly to\n\nzero as their distance is more than a few femtometres. This\n\nleads to saturation of forces in a medium or a large-sized\n\nnucleus, which is the reason for the constancy of the\n\nbinding energy per nucleon.\n\nA rough plot of the potential energy between two nucleons\n\nas a function of distance is shown in the Fig. 13.2. The\n\npotential energy is a minimum at a distance r\n0\n of about\n\n0.8 fm. This means that the force is attractive for distances larger\n\nthan 0.8 fm and repulsive if they are separated by distances less\n\nthan 0.8 fm.\n\nFIGURE 13.2 Potential energy\nof a pair of nucleons as a\n\nfunction of their separation.\n\nFor a separation greater\nthan r\n\n0\n, the force is attractive\n\nand for separations less\n\nthan r\n0\n, the force is\n\nstrongly repulsive.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n446\n\n(iii) The nuclear force between neutron-neutron, proton-neutron and\nproton-proton is approximately the same. The nuclear force does not\ndepend on the electric charge.\n\nUnlike Coulomb’s law or the Newton’s law of gravitation there is no\nsimple mathematical form of the nuclear force.\n\n13.6  RADIOACTIVITY\nA. H. Becquerel discovered radioactivity in 1896 purely by accident.  While\n\nstudying the fluorescence and phosphorescence of compounds irradiated\nwith visible light, Becquerel observed an interesting phenomenon.  After\nilluminating some pieces of uranium-potassium sulphate with visible\n\nlight, he wrapped them in black paper and separated the package from a\nphotographic plate by a piece of silver.  When, after several hours of\nexposure, the photographic plate was developed, it showed blackening\n\ndue to something that must have been emitted by the compound and\nwas able to penetrate both black paper and the silver.\n\nExperiments performed subsequently showed that radioactivity was\n\na nuclear phenomenon in which an unstable nucleus undergoes a decay.\nThis is referred to as radioactive decay. Three types of radioactive decay\noccur in nature :\n\n(i) α-decay in which a helium nucleus 4\n2\nHe  is emitted;\n\n(ii) β-decay in which electrons or positrons (particles with the same mass\nas electrons, but with a charge exactly opposite to that of electron)\nare emitted;\n\n(iii) γ-decay in which high energy (hundreds of keV or more) photons are\nemitted.\n\nEach of these decay will be considered in subsequent sub-sections.\n\n13.6.1  Law of radioactive decay\n\nIn any radioactive sample, which undergoes α, β or γ-decay, it is found\nthat the number of nuclei undergoing the decay per unit time is\nproportional to the total number of nuclei in the sample. If N is the\n\nnumber of nuclei in the sample and ∆N undergo decay in time ∆t then\n\nN\nN\n\nt\n\n∆\n∝\n\n∆\n\nor,  ∆N/∆t = λN, (13.10)\n\nwhere λ is called the radioactive decay constant or disintegration constant.\n\nThe change in the number of nuclei in the sample* is dN = – ∆N in\n\ntime ∆t. Thus the rate of change of N is (in the limit ∆t → 0)\n\nd\n–\n\nd\n\nN\nN\n\nt\nλ=\n\n* ∆N is the number of nuclei that decay, and hence is always positive. dN is the\nchange in N, which may have either sign. Here it is negative, because out of\noriginal N nuclei, ∆N have decayed, leaving (N–∆N ) nuclei.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n447\n\nNuclei\n\nor,  \ndN\n\nN\n = –λdt\n\nNow, integrating both sides of the above equation,we get,\n\n(13.11)\n\nor, ln N  − ln N\n0\n = −λ (t – t\n\n0\n) (13.12)\n\nHere N\n0\n is the number of radioactive nuclei in the sample at some\n\narbitrary time t\n0\n and N is the number of radioactive nuclei at any\n\nsubsequent time t.  Setting t\n0\n = 0 and rearranging Eq. (13.12) gives us\n\nln\n0\n\nN\nt\n\nN\n= −λ (13.13)\n\nwhich gives\n\nN(t) = N\n0\n e \n\n−λ t\n(13.14)\n\nNote, for example, the light bulbs follow no such exponential decay law.\nIf we test 1000 bulbs for their life (time span before they burn out or\nfuse), we expect that they will ‘decay’ (that is, burn out) at more or less\nthe same time. The decay of radionuclides follows quite a different law,\nthe law of radioactive decay represented by Eq. (13.14).\n\nThe total decay rate R of a sample is the number of nuclei\ndisintegrating per unit time. Suppose in a time interval dt, the decay\ncount measured  is ∆N. Then dN = – ∆N.\n\nThe positive quantity R is then defined as\n\nR = –\nd\n\nd\n\nN\n\nt\n\nDifferentiating Eq. (13.14), we get\n\nR  = λN\n0\n e \n\n−λt\n\nor,  R  = R\n0\n e –λt (13.15)\n\nThis is equivalant to the law of radioactivity decay,\nsince you can integrate Eq. (13.15) to get back Eq.\n\n(13.14). Clearly, R\n0\n  = λN\n\n0\n is the  decay rate at t = 0. The\n\ndecay rate R at a certain time t and the number of\n\nundecayed nuclei N at the same time are related by\n\nR  = λN (13.16)\n\nThe decay rate of a sample, rather than the number of radioactive\n\nnuclei, is a more direct experimentally measurable quantity and is given\n\na specific name: activity. The SI unit for activity is becquerel, named\n\nafter the discoverer of radioactivity, Henry Becquerel.\n\nFIGURE 13.3 Exponential decay of a\n\nradioactive species.

Half-life of a radionuclide\n(denoted by T\n\n1/2\n) is the time it takes for a sample that has\n\ninitially, say N\n0\n radionuclei to reduce to N\n\n0\n/2.

(13.16).\n\nAnother related measure is the average or mean life\nτ. This again can be obtained from Eq. (13.14). The\nnumber of nuclei which decay in the time interval t to t +\n∆t is R(t )∆t  (= λN\n\n0\ne\n\n–λt\n∆t ).  Each of them has lived for time\n\nt. Thus the total life of all these nuclei would be t λN\n0\ne\n\n–λt\n\n∆t. It is clear that some nuclei may live for a short time\nwhile others may live longer. Therefore to obtain the mean\nlife, we have to sum (or integrate) this expression over all\ntimes from 0 to ∞ , and divide by the total number N0 of\nnuclei at t = 0.

In the next 12.5 y, one-half of these nuclei\nwould have decayed.  Hence, one fourth of the sample of the initial\n\npure tritium will remain undecayed.\n\n13.6.2  Alpha decay\n\nA well-known example of alpha decay is the decay of uranium 238\n92 U to\n\nthorium 234\n90 Th  with the emission of a helium nucleus \n\n4\n2 He\n\n238\n92U → \n\n234\n90 Th  + \n\n4\n2 He                (α-decay) (13.19)\n\nIn α-decay, the mass number of the product nucleus (daughter\nnucleus) is four less than that of the decaying nucleus (parent nucleus),\n\nwhile the atomic number decreases by two. In general, α-decay of a parent\n\nnucleus  A\nZ X  results in a daughter nucleus \n\nA 4\nZ 2Y\n\n−\n−\n\nA\nZ X  → \n\nA 4\nZ 2Y\n\n−\n−\n\n + 4\n2 He (13.20)\n\nFrom Einstein’s mass-energy equivalance relation [Eq. (13.6)] and\nenergy conservation, it is clear that this spontaneous decay is possible\nonly when the total mass of the decay products is less than the mass of\n\nthe initial nucleus. This difference in mass appears as kinetic energy of\nthe products. By referring to a table of nuclear masses, one can check\n\nthat the total mass of 234\n90 Th  and \n\n4\n2 He  is indeed less than that of \n\n238\n92U.\n\nThe disintegration energy or the Q-value of a nuclear reaction is the\n\ndifference between the initial mass energy and the total mass energy of\n\nthe decay products. For α-decay\n\nQ = (m\nX\n – m\n\nY\n – m\n\nHe\n) c2 (13.21)\n\nQ is also the net kinetic energy gained in the process or, if the initial\nnucleus X is at rest, the kinetic energy of the products. Clearly, Q> 0 for\n\nexothermic processes such as α-decay.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n450\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n3\n.6\n\nExample 13.6 We are given the following atomic masses:\n238\n92U  = 238.05079 u\n\n4\n2 He = 4.00260 u\n\n234\n90 Th  = 234.04363 u\n\n1\n1H= 1.00783 u\n\n237\n91Pa = 237.05121 u\n\nHere the symbol Pa is for the element protactinium (Z = 91).\n\n(a) Calculate the energy released during the alpha decay of 238\n92U.\n\n(b) Show that 238\n92U  can not spontaneously emit a proton.\n\nSolution\n\n(a) The alpha decay of 238\n92 U  is given by Eq. (13.20). The energy released\n\nin this process is given by\n\nQ = (m\nU\n – m\n\nTh\n – m\n\nHe\n) c\n\n2\n\nSubstituting the atomic masses as given in the data, we find\nQ = (238.05079 – 234.04363 – 4.00260)u × c\n\n2\n\n   = (0.00456 u) c\n2\n\n   = (0.00456 u) (931.5 MeV/u)\n   = 4.25 MeV.\n\n(b) If  238\n92U  spontaneously emits a proton, the decay process would be\n\n238\n92U  → \n\n237\n91Pa  + \n\n1\n1H\n\nThe Q for this process to happen is\n= (m\n\nU\n – m\n\nPa\n – m\n\nH\n) c\n\n2\n\n= (238.05079 – 237.05121 – 1.00783) u × c\n2\n\n= (– 0.00825 u) c\n2\n\n= – (0.00825 u)(931.5 MeV/u)\n= – 7.68 MeV\n\nThus, the Q of the process is negative and therefore it cannot proceed\nspontaneously.  We will have to supply an energy of 7.68 MeV to a\n238\n92U  nucleus to make it emit a proton.\n\n13.6.3  Beta decay\n\nIn beta decay, a nucleus spontaneously emits an electron (β\n−−−−− \ndecay) or a\n\npositron (β+ decay). A common example of β −−\n−−− decay is\n\n32 32\n15 16P S e ν\n\n−\n→ + + (13.22)\n\nand that of β+  decay is\n\n22 22\n11 10Na Ne e ν\n\n+\n→ + + (13.23)\n\nThe decays are governed by the Eqs. (13.14) and (13.15), so that one\ncan never predict which nucleus will undergo decay, but one can\n\ncharacterize the decay by a half-life T\n1/2\n\n . For example, T\n1/2\n\n for the decays\nabove is respectively 14.3 d and 2.6y. The emission of electron in β\n\n−−−−− \ndecay\n\nis accompanied by the emission of an antineutrino (ν ); in β\n+ \ndecay, instead,\n\na neutrino (ν) is generated. Neutrinos are neutral particles with very small\n(possiblly, even zero) mass compared to electrons. They have only weak\ninteraction with other particles. They are, therefore, very difficult to detect,\n\nsince they can penetrate large quantity of matter (even earth) without any\ninteraction.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n451\n\nNuclei\n\nIn both β\n−−−−−\n and β\n\n+ \ndecay, the mass number A remains unchanged. In\n\nβ\n−−−−− \ndecay, the atomic number Z of the nucleus goes up by 1, while in β\n\n+\n\ndecay Z goes down by 1. The basic nuclear process underlying β\n−−−−−\n decay\n\nis the conversion of neutron to proton\n\nn → p + e\n–\n + ν (13.24)\n\nwhile for β\n+ \ndecay, it is the conversion of proton into neutron\n\np → n + e\n+\n + ν (13.25)\n\nNote that while a free neutron decays to proton, the decay of proton to\nneutron [Eq. (13.25)] is possible only inside the nucleus, since proton\nhas smaller mass than neutron.\n\n13.6.4  Gamma decay\n\nLike an atom, a nucleus also has discrete energy levels - the ground\n\nstate and excited states. The scale of energy is, however, very different.\nAtomic energy level spacings are of the order of eV, while the difference in\nnuclear energy levels is of the order of MeV. When a\n\nnucleus in an excited state spontaneously decays\nto its ground state (or to a lower energy state), a\nphoton is emitted with energy equal to the difference\n\nin the two energy levels of the nucleus. This is the\nso-called gamma decay. The energy (MeV)\ncorresponds to radiation of extremely short\n\nwavelength, shorter than the hard X-ray region.\nTypically, a gamma ray is emitted when a α or β\n\ndecay results in a daughter nucleus in an excited\n\nstate. This then returns to the ground state by a\nsingle photon transition or successive transitions\ninvolving more than one photon. A familiar example\n\nis the successive emmission of gamma rays of\nenergies 1.17 MeV and 1.33 MeV from the\n\ndeexcitation of  60\n28 Ni  nuclei formed from  β\n\n−−−−− \ndecay\n\nof 60\n27Co .\n\n13.7  NUCLEAR ENERGY\nThe curve of binding energy per nucleon E\n\nbn\n, given in Fig. 13.1, has\n\na long flat middle region between A = 30 and A = 170. In this region\n\nthe binding energy per nucleon is nearly constant (8.0 MeV). For\n\nthe lighter nuclei region, A < 30, and for the heavier nuclei region,\n\nA > 170, the binding energy per nucleon is less than 8.0 MeV, as we\n\nhave noted earlier. Now, the greater the binding energy, the less is the\n\ntotal mass of a bound system, such as a nucleus. Consequently, if nuclei\n\nwith less total binding energy transform to nuclei with greater binding\n\nenergy, there will be a net energy release. This is what happens when a\n\nheavy nucleus decays into two or more intermediate mass fragments\n\n(fission) or when light nuclei fuse into a havier nucleus (fusion.)\n\nExothermic chemical reactions underlie conventional energy sources\n\nsuch as coal or petroleum. Here the energies involved are in the range of\n\nFIGURE 13.4 β-decay of \n28\n\n60\nNi  nucleus\n\nfollowed by emission of two γ rays\nfrom deexcitation of the daughter\n\nnucleus \n28\n\n60\nNi .\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n452\n\nelectron volts. On the other hand,  in a nuclear reaction, the energy release\n\nis of the order of MeV. Thus for the same quantity of matter, nuclear\n\nsources produce a million times more energy than a chemical source.\n\nFission of 1 kg of uranium, for example, generates 10\n14\n\n J of energy;\n\ncompare it with burning of 1 kg of coal that gives 10\n7\n J.\n\n13.7.1  Fission\n\nNew possibilities emerge when we go beyond natural radioactive decays\n\nand study nuclear reactions by bombarding nuclei with other nuclear\nparticles such as proton, neutron, α-particle, etc.\n\nA most important neutron-induced nuclear reaction is fission. An\n\nexample of fission is when a uranium isotope 235\n92 U  bombarded with a\n\nneutron breaks into two intermediate mass nuclear fragments\n\n1 235 236 144 89 1\n0 92 92 56 36 0n U U Ba Kr 3 n+ → → + + (13.26)\n\nThe same reaction can produce other pairs of intermediate mass\nfragments\n\n1 235 236 133 99 1\n0 92 92 51 41 0n U U Sb Nb 4 n+ → → + + (13.27)\n\nOr, as another example,\n\n1 235 140 94 1\n0 92 54 38 0n U Xe Sr 2 n+ → + + (13.28)\n\nThe fragment products are radioactive nuclei; they emit β particles in\nsuccession to achieve stable end products.\n\nThe energy released (the Q value ) in the fission reaction of nuclei like\nuranium is of the order of 200 MeV per fissioning nucleus. This is\nestimated as follows:\n\nLet us take a nucleus with A = 240 breaking into two fragments each\nof A = 120. Then\n\nE\nbn\n\n for A = 240 nucleus is about 7.6 MeV,\n\nE\nbn \n\nfor the two A = 120 fragment nuclei is about 8.5 MeV.\n\n∴ Gain in binding energy for nucleon is about 0.9 MeV.\n\nHence the total gain in binding energy is 240×0.9 or 216 MeV.\n\nThe disintegration energy in fission events first appears as the kinetic\n\nenergy of the fragments and neutrons. Eventually it is transferred to the\n\nsurrounding matter appearing as heat. The source of energy in nuclear\n\nreactors, which produce electricity, is nuclear fission. The enormous\n\nenergy released in an atom bomb comes from uncontrolled nuclear fission.\n\nWe discuss some details in the next section how a nuclear reactor\n\nfunctions.\n\n13.7.2  Nuclear reactor\n\nNotice one fact of great importance in the fission reactions given in Eqs.\n(13.26) to (13.28). There is a release of extra neutron (s) in the fission\nprocess. Averagely, 2½ neutrons are released per fission of uranium\n\nnucleus. It is a fraction since in some fission events 2 neutrons are\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n453\n\nNuclei\n\nproduced, in some 3, etc. The extra neutrons in turn can initiate fission\nprocesses, producing still more neutrons, and so on. This leads to the\n\npossibility of a chain reaction, as was first suggested by Enrico Fermi. If\nthe chain reaction is controlled suitably, we can get a steady energy\n\nINDIA’S ATOMIC ENERGY PROGRAMME\n\nThe atomic energy programme in India was launched around the time of independence\nunder the leadership of Homi J. Bhabha (1909-1966). An early historic achievement\n\nwas the design and construction of the first nuclear reactor in India (named Apsara)\nwhich went critical on August 4, 1956. It used enriched uranium as fuel and water as\nmoderator. Following this was another notable landmark: the construction of CIRUS\n\n(Canada India Research U.S.) reactor in 1960. This 40 MW reactor used natural uranium\nas fuel and heavy water as moderator. Apsara and CIRUS spurred research in a wide\nrange of areas of basic and applied nuclear science. An important milestone in the first\n\ntwo decades of the programme was the indigenous design and construction of the\nplutonium plant at Trombay, which ushered in the technology of fuel reprocessing\n(separating useful fissile and fertile nuclear materials from the spent fuel of a reactor) in\n\nIndia. Research reactors that have been subsequently commissioned include ZERLINA,\nPURNIMA (I, II and III), DHRUVA and KAMINI. KAMINI is the country’s first large research\nreactor that uses U-233 as fuel. As the name suggests, the primary objective of a research\n\nreactor is not generation of power but to provide a facility for research on different aspects\nof nuclear science and technology. Research reactors are also an excellent source for\nproduction of a variety of radioactive isotopes that find application in diverse fields:\n\nindustry, medicine and agriculture.\nThe main objectives of the Indian Atomic Energy programme are to provide safe and\n\nreliable electric power for the country’s social and economic progress and to be self-\n\nreliant in all aspects of nuclear technology. Exploration of atomic minerals in India\nundertaken since the early fifties has indicated that India has limited reserves of uranium,\nbut fairly abundant reserves of thorium. Accordingly, our country has adopted a three-\n\nstage strategy of nuclear power generation. The first stage involves the use of natural\nuranium as a fuel, with heavy water as moderator. The Plutonium-239 obtained from\nreprocessing of the discharged fuel from the reactors then serves as a fuel for the second\n\nstage — the fast breeder reactors. They are so called because they use fast neutrons for\nsustaining the chain reaction (hence no moderator is needed) and, besides generating\npower, also breed more fissile species (plutonium) than they consume. The third stage,\n\nmost significant in the long term, involves using fast breeder reactors to produce fissile\nUranium-233 from Thorium-232 and to build power reactors based on them.\n\nIndia is currently well into the second stage of the programme and considerable\n\nwork has also been done on the third — the thorium utilisation — stage. The country\nhas mastered the complex technologies of mineral exploration and mining, fuel\nfabrication, heavy water production, reactor design, construction and operation, fuel\n\nreprocessing, etc. Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) built at different sites in\nthe country mark the accomplishment of the first stage of the programme. India is now\nmore than self-sufficient in heavy water production. Elaborate safety measures both in\n\nthe design and operation of reactors, as also adhering to stringent standards of\nradiological protection are the hallmark of the Indian Atomic Energy Programme.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n454\n\noutput. This is what happens in a nuclear reactor. If the chain reaction is\nuncontrolled, it leads to explosive energy output, as in a nuclear bomb.\n\nThere is, however, a hurdle in sustaining a chain reaction, as described\n\nhere. It is known experimentally that slow neutrons (thermal neutrons)\n\nare much more likely to cause fission in 235\n92 U  than fast neutrons. Also\n\nfast neutrons liberated in fission would escape instead of causing another\n\nfission reaction.\n\nThe average energy of a neutron produced in fission of 235\n92 U  is 2 MeV.\n\nThese neutrons unless slowed down will escape from the reactor without\n\ninteracting with the uranium nuclei, unless a very large amount of\nfissionable material is used for sustaining the chain reaction. What one\nneeds to do is to slow down the fast neutrons by elastic scattering with\n\nlight nuclei. In fact, Chadwick’s experiments showed that in an elastic\ncollision with hydrogen the neutron almost comes to rest and proton\ncarries away the energy. This is the same situation as when a marble hits\n\nhead-on an identical marble at rest. Therefore, in reactors, light nuclei\ncalled moderators are provided along with the fissionable nuclei for slowing\ndown fast neutrons. The moderators commonly used are water, heavy\n\nwater (D\n2\nO) and graphite. The Apsara reactor at the Bhabha Atomic\n\nResearch Centre (BARC), Mumbai, uses water as moderator. The other\nIndian reactors, which are used for power production, use heavy water\n\nas moderator.\nBecause of the use of moderator, it is possible that the ratio, K, of\n\nnumber of fission produced by a given generation of neutrons to the\n\nnumber of fission of the preceeding generation may be greater than one.\nThis ratio is called the multiplication factor; it is the measure of the growth\nrate of the neutrons in the reactor.  For K = 1, the operation of the reactor\nis said to be critical, which is what we wish it to be for steady power\noperation. If K becomes greater than one, the reaction rate and the reactor\npower increases exponentially. Unless the factor K is brought down very\nclose to unity, the reactor will become supercritical and can even explode.\nThe explosion of the Chernobyl reactor in Ukraine in 1986 is a sad\nreminder that accidents in a nuclear reactor can be catastrophic.\n\nThe reaction rate is controlled through control-rods made out of\nneutron-absorbing material such as cadmium. In addition to control rods,\nreactors are provided with safety rods which, when required, can be\ninserted into the reactor and K can be reduced rapidly to less than unity.\n\nThe more abundant isotope 238\n92 U  in naturally occurring uranium is\n\nnon-fissionable. When it captures a neutron, it produces the highly\nradioactive plutonium through these reactions\n\n238 239 239 –\n92 92 93U+ n U Np+e ν→ → +\n\n239 239 –\n93 94Np Pu+e ν→ + (13.29)\n\nPlutonium undergoes fission with slow neutrons.\n\nFigure 13.5 shows the schematic diagram of a nuclear reactor based\non thermal neutron fission. The core of the reactor is the site of nuclear\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n455\n\nNuclei\n\nfission. It contains the fuel elements in suitably fabricated form. The fuel\nmay be say enriched uranium (i.e., one that has greater abundance of\n235\n92 U  than naturally occurring uranium). The core contains a moderator\n\nto slow down the neutrons. The core is surrounded by a reflector to reduce\nleakage. The energy (heat) released in fission is continuously removed by\na suitable coolant. A containment vessel prevents the escape of radioactive\nfission products. The whole assembly is shielded to check harmful\nradiation from coming out. The reactor can be shut down by means of\nrods (made of, for example, cadmium) that have high absorption of\nneutrons. The coolant transfers heat to a working fluid which in turn\nmay produce stream. The steam drives turbines and generates electricity.\n\nLike any power reactor, nuclear reactors generate considerable waste\nproducts. But nuclear wastes need special care for treatment since they\nare radioactive and hazardous. Elaborate safety measures, both for reactor\n\noperation as well as handling and reprocessing the spent fuel, are\n\nrequired. These safety measures are a distinguishing feature of the Indian\n\nAtomic Energy programme. An appropriate plan is being evolved to study\nthe possibility of converting radioactive waste into less active and short-\n\nlived material.\n\n13.7.3  Nuclear fusion – energy generation in stars\n\nWhen two light nuclei fuse to form a larger nucleus, energy is released,\nsince the larger nucleus is more tightly bound, as seen from the binding\nenergy curve in Fig.13.1. Some examples of such energy liberating nuclear\n\nfusion reactions are :\n\n1 1 2\n1 1 1H H H+ → + e\n\n+\n + ν + 0.42 MeV [13.29(a)]\n\n2 2 3\n1 1 2H H He+ → + n + 3.27 MeV [13.29(b)]\n\n2 2 3 1\n1 1 1 1H H H H+ → + + 4.03 MeV [13.29(c)]\n\nA\n s\n\nim\np\n\nlifie\nd\n o\n\nn\nlin\n\ne\n s\n\nim\nu\nla\n\ntio\nn\n o\n\nf a\n n\n\nu\nc\nle\n\na\nr re\n\na\nc\nto\n\nr\n\nh\nttp\n\n://e\nsa\n\n2\n1\n.k\n\ne\nn\nn\ne\nsa\n\nw\n.e\n\nd\nu\n/a\n\nc\ntiv\n\nitie\ns/n\n\nu\nk\ne\ne\nn\ne\nrg\n\ny\n/n\n\nu\nk\ne\n.h\n\ntm\n\nFIGURE 13.5 Schematic diagram of a nuclear reactor based on\nthermal neutron fission.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n456\n\nIn the first reaction, two protons combine to form a deuteron and\na positron with a release of 0.42 MeV energy. In reaction [13.29(b)], two\ndeuterons combine to form the light isotope of helium. In reaction\n(13.29c), two deuterons combine to form a triton and a proton. For\nfusion to take place, the two nuclei must come close enough so that\nattractive short-range nuclear force is able to affect them. However,\nsince they are both positively charged particles, they experience coulomb\nrepulsion. They, therefore, must have enough energy to overcome this\ncoulomb barrier. The height of the barrier depends on the charges and\nradii of the two interacting nuclei. It can be shown, for example, that\nthe barrier height for two protons is ~ 400 keV, and is higher for nuclei\nwith higher charges. We can estimate the temperature at which two\nprotons in a proton gas would (averagely) have enough energy to\novercome the coulomb barrier:\n\n(3/2)k T = K �  400 keV, which gives T ~ 3 × 10\n9\n K.\n\nWhen fusion is achieved by raising the temperature of the system so\nthat particles have enough kinetic energy to overcome the coulomb\nrepulsive behaviour, it is called thermonuclear fusion.\n\nThermonuclear fusion is the source of energy output in the interior\nof stars. The interior of the sun has a temperature of 1.5×10\n\n7\n K, which\n\nis considerably less than the estimated temperature required for fusion\nof particles of average energy. Clearly, fusion in the sun involves protons\nwhose energies are much above the average energy.\n\nThe fusion reaction in the sun is a multi-step process in which the\nhydrogen is burned into helium. Thus, the fuel in the sun is the hydrogen\nin its core. The proton-proton (p, p) cycle by which this occurs is\nrepresented by the following sets of reactions:\n\n1 1 2\n1 1 1H H H+ → + e\n\n+\n + ν + 0.42 MeV (i)\n\ne\n+\n + e\n\n–\n → γ + γ + 1.02 MeV (ii)\n\n2 1 3\n1 1 2H H He+ → + γ + 5.49 MeV (iii)\n\n+ → + +\n3 3 4 1 1\n2 2 2 1 1He He He H H + 12.86 MeV (iv) (13.30)\n\nFor the fourth reaction to occur, the first three reactions must occur\n\ntwice, in which case two light helium nuclei unite to form ordinary helium\nnucleus. If we consider the combination 2(i) + 2(ii) + 2(iii) +(iv), the net\neffect is\n\n1 4\n1 24 H 2 He 2 6 26.7 MeVe ν γ\n\n−\n+ → + + +\n\nor 1 4\n1 2(4 H 4 ) ( He 2 ) 2 6 26.7MeVe e ν γ\n\n− −\n+ → + + + + (13.31)\n\nThus, four hydrogen atoms combine to form an 4\n2He  atom with a\n\nrelease of 26.7 MeV of energy.\n\nHelium is not the only element that can be synthesized in the interior\nof a star. As the hydrogen in the core gets depleted and becomes  helium,\n\nthe core starts to cool. The star begins to collapse under its own gravity\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n457\n\nNuclei\n\nwhich increases the temperature of the core. If this temperature increases\nto about 10\n\n8\n K, fusion takes place again, this time of helium nuclei into\n\ncarbon. This kind of process can generate through fusion higher and\n\nhigher mass number elements. But elements more massive than those\nnear the peak of the binding energy curve in Fig. 13.1 cannot be so\nproduced.\n\nThe age of the sun is about 5×10\n9\n y and it is estimated that there is\n\nenough hydrogen in the sun to keep it going for another 5 billion years.\nAfter that, the hydrogen burning will stop and the sun will begin to cool\n\nand will start to collapse under gravity, which will raise the core\ntemperature. The outer envelope of the sun will expand, turning it into\nthe so called red giant.\n\nNUCLEAR HOLOCAUST\n\nIn a single uranium fission about 0.9×235 MeV (≈200 MeV) of energy is liberated. If\neach nucleus of about 50 kg of \n\n235\nU undergoes fission the amount of energy involved is\n\nabout 4 × 10\n15\n\nJ. This energy is equivalent to about 20,000 tons of TNT, enough for a\nsuperexplosion. Uncontrolled release of large nuclear energy is called an atomic explosion.\nOn August 6, 1945 an atomic device was used in warfare for the first time. The US\n\ndropped an atom bomb on Hiroshima, Japan. The explosion was equivalent to 20,000\ntons of TNT. Instantly the radioactive products devastated 10 sq km of the city which\nhad 3,43,000 inhabitants. Of this number 66,000 were killed and 69,000 were injured;\n\nmore than 67% of the city’s structures were destroyed.\nHigh temperature conditions for fusion reactions can be created by exploding a fission\n\nbomb. Super-explosions equivalent to 10 megatons of explosive power of TNT were tested\n\nin 1954. Such bombs which involve fusion of isotopes of hydrogen, deuterium and tritium\nare called hydrogen bombs. It is estimated that a nuclear arsenal sufficient to destroy\nevery form of life on this planet several times over is in position to be triggered by the\n\npress of a button. Such a nuclear holocaust will not only destroy the life that exists now\nbut its radioactive fallout will make this planet unfit for life for all times. Scenarios based\non theoretical calculations predict a long nuclear winter, as the radioactive waste will\n\nhang like a cloud in the earth’s atmosphere and will absorb the sun’s radiation.\n\n13.7.4  Controlled thermonuclear fusion\n\nThe natural thermonuclear fusion process in a star is replicated in a\nthermonuclear fusion device. In controlled fusion reactors, the aim is to\n\ngenerate steady power by heating the nuclear fuel to a temperature in the\nrange of 10\n\n8\n K. At these temperatures, the fuel is a mixture of positive\n\nions and electrons (plasma). The challenge is to confine this plasma, since\n\nno container can stand such a high temperature. Several countries\naround the world including India are developing techniques in this\nconnection. If successful, fusion reactors will hopefully supply almost\n\nunlimited power to humanity.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n458  E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n3\n.7\n\nExample 13.7 Answer the following questions:\n\n(a) Are the equations of nuclear reactions (such as those given in\nSection 13.7) ‘balanced’ in the sense a chemical equation (e.g.,\n\n2H\n2\n + O\n\n2\n→ 2 H\n\n2\nO)  is? If not, in what sense are they balanced on\n\nboth sides?\n\n(b) If both the number of protons and the number of neutrons are\nconserved in each nuclear reaction, in what way is mass converted\ninto energy (or vice-versa) in a nuclear reaction?\n\n(c) A general impression exists that  mass-energy interconversion\ntakes place only in nuclear reaction and never in chemical\n\nreaction. This is strictly speaking, incorrect. Explain.\n\nSolution\n\n(a) A chemical equation is balanced in the sense that the number of\n\natoms of each element is the same on both sides of the equation.\n\nA chemical reaction merely alters the original combinations of\n\natoms. In a nuclear reaction, elements may be transmuted. Thus,\n\nthe number of atoms of each element is not necessarily conserved\n\nin a nuclear reaction. However, the number of protons and the\n\nnumber of neutrons are both separately conserved in a nuclear\n\nreaction. [Actually, even this is not strictly true in the realm of\n\nvery high energies – what is strictly conserved is the total charge\n\nand total ‘baryon number’. We need not pursue this matter here.]\n\nIn nuclear reactions (e.g., Eq. 13.26), the number of protons and\n\nthe number of neutrons are the same on the two sides of the equation.\n\n(b) We know that the binding energy of a nucleus gives a negative\n\ncontribution to the mass of the nucleus (mass defect). Now, since\n\nproton number and neutron number are conserved in a nuclear\n\nreaction, the total rest mass of neutrons and protons is the same\n\non either side of a reaction. But the total binding energy of nuclei\n\non the left side need not be the same as that on the right hand\n\nside. The difference in these binding energies appears as energy\n\nreleased or absorbed in a nuclear reaction. Since binding energy\n\ncontributes to mass, we say that the difference in the total mass\n\nof nuclei on the two sides get converted into energy or vice-versa.\n\nIt is in these sense that a nuclear reaction is an example of mass-\n\nenergy interconversion.\n\n(c) From the point of view of mass-energy interconversion, a chemical\n\nreaction is similar to a nuclear reaction in principle. The energy\n\nreleased or absorbed in a chemical reaction can be traced to the\n\ndifference in chemical (not nuclear) binding energies of atoms and\n\nmolecules on the two sides of a reaction. Since, strictly speaking,\n\nchemical binding energy also gives a negative contribution (mass\n\ndefect) to the total mass of an atom or molecule, we can equally\n\nwell say that the difference in the total mass of atoms or molecules,\n\non the two sides of the chemical reaction gets converted into energy\n\nor vice-versa. However, the mass defects involved in a chemical\n\nreaction are almost a million times smaller than those in a nuclear\n\nreaction.This is the reason for the general impression, (which is\n\nincorrect ) that mass-energy interconversion does not take place\n\nin a chemical reaction.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n459\n\nNuclei\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. An atom has a nucleus. The nucleus is positively charged. The radius\n\nof the nucleus is smaller than the radius of an atom by a factor of\n\n10\n4\n. More than 99.9% mass of the atom is concentrated in the nucleus.\n\n2. On the atomic scale, mass is measured in atomic mass units (u). By\ndefinition, 1 atomic mass unit (1u) is 1/12th mass of one atom of 12C;\n\n1u = 1.660563 × 10\n–27\n\n kg.\n\n3. A nucleus contains a neutral particle called neutron. Its mass is almost\n\nthe same as that of proton\n\n4. The atomic number Z is the number of protons in the atomic nucleus\n\nof an element. The mass number A is the total number of protons and\nneutrons in the atomic nucleus; A = Z+N; Here N denotes the number\n\nof neutrons in the nucleus.\n\nA nuclear species or a nuclide is represented as  X\nA\nZ , where X is the\n\nchemical symbol of the species.\n\nNuclides with the same atomic number Z, but different neutron number\n\nN are called isotopes. Nuclides with the same A are isobars and those\n\nwith the same N are isotones.\n\nMost elements are mixtures of two or more isotopes. The atomic mass\n\nof an element is a weighted average of the masses of its isotopes and\n\ncalculated in accordance to the relative abundances of the isotopes.\n\n5. A nucleus can be considered to be spherical in shape and assigned a\n\nradius. Electron scattering experiments allow determination of the\n\nnuclear radius; it is found that radii of nuclei fit the formula\n\nR = R\n0\n A\n\n1/3\n,\n\nwhere R\n0\n = a constant = 1.2 fm. This implies that the nuclear density\n\nis independent of A. It is of the order of 10\n17\n\n kg/m\n3\n.\n\n6. Neutrons and protons are bound in a nucleus by the short-range strong\n\nnuclear force. The nuclear force does not distinguish between neutron\n\nand proton.\n\n7. The nuclear mass M is always less than the total mass, Σm, of its\n\nconstituents. The difference in mass of a nucleus and its constituents\n\nis called the mass defect,\n\n∆M = (Z m\np\n + (A – Z )m\n\nn\n) – M\n\nUsing Einstein’s mass energy relation, we express this mass difference\n\nin terms of energy as\n\n∆E\nb\n = ∆M c\n\n2\n\nThe energy ∆E\nb\n represents the binding energy of the nucleus. In the\n\nmass number range A = 30 to 170, the binding energy per nucleon is\n\nnearly constant, about 8 MeV/nucleon.\n\n8. Energies associated with nuclear processes are about a million times\n\nlarger than chemical process.\n\n9. The Q-value of a nuclear process is\n\n      Q = final kinetic energy – initial kinetic energy.\n\nDue to conservation of mass-energy, this is also,\n\nQ = (sum of initial masses – sum of final masses)c\n2\n\n10. Radioactivity is the phenomenon in which nuclei of a given species\n\ntransform by giving out α or β or γ rays; α-rays are helium nuclei;\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n460\n\nβ-rays are electrons. γ-rays are electromagnetic radiation of wavelengths\nshorter than X-rays;\n\n11. Law of radioactive decay : N (t) = N(0) e–λt\n\nwhere λ is the decay constant or disintegration constant.\n\nThe half-life T\n1/2\n\n of a radionuclide is the time in which N has been\n\nreduced to one-half of its initial value. The mean life τ is the time at\nwhich N has been reduced to e\n\n–1\n of its initial value\n\n1/2\n\nln 2\nln 2T τ\n\nλ\n= =\n\n12. Energy is released when less tightly bound nuclei are transmuted into\n\nmore tightly bound nuclei. In fission, a heavy nucleus like \n235\n92 U  breaks\n\ninto two smaller fragments, e.g., 235 1 133 99 1\n92 0 51 41 0U+ n Sb Nb + 4 n→ +\n\n13. The fact that more neutrons are produced in fission than are consumed\n\ngives the possibility of a chain reaction with each neutron that is\nproduced triggering another fission. The chain reaction is uncontrolled\n\nand rapid in a nuclear bomb explosion. It is controlled and steady in\n\na nuclear reactor. In a reactor, the value of the neutron multiplication\n\nfactor k is maintained at 1.\n\n14. In fusion, lighter nuclei combine to form a larger nucleus. Fusion of\n\nhydrogen nuclei into helium nuclei is the source of energy of all stars\nincluding our sun.\n\nPhysical Quantity Symbol Dimensions Units Remarks\n\nAtomic mass unit [M] u Unit of mass for\nexpressing atomic or\n\nnuclear masses.

The density of nuclear matter is independent of the size of the nucleus.\n\nThe mass density of the atom does not follow this rule.\n\n2. The radius of a nucleus determined by electron scattering is found to\n\nbe slightly different from that determined by alpha-particle scattering.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n461\n\nNuclei\n\nThis is because electron scattering senses the charge distribution of\n\nthe nucleus, whereas alpha and similar particles sense the nuclear\n\nmatter.\n\n3. After Einstein showed the equivalence of mass and energy, E = mc\n2\n,\n\nwe cannot any longer speak of separate laws of conservation of mass\n\nand conservation of energy, but we have to speak of a unified law of\n\nconservation of mass and energy. The most convincing evidence that\n\nthis principle operates in nature comes from nuclear physics. It is\n\ncentral to our understanding of nuclear energy and harnessing it as a\n\nsource of power. Using the principle, Q of a nuclear process (decay or\n\nreaction) can be expressed also in terms of initial and final masses.\n\n4. The nature of the binding energy (per nucleon) curve shows that\n\nexothermic nuclear reactions are possible, when two light nuclei fuse\n\nor when a heavy nucleus undergoes fission into nuclei with intermediate\n\nmass.\n\n5. For fusion, the light nuclei must have sufficient initial energy to\n\novercome the coulomb potential barrier. That is why fusion requires\n\nvery high temperatures.\n\n6. Although the binding energy (per nucleon) curve is smooth and slowly\n\nvarying, it shows peaks at nuclides like \n4\nHe, \n\n16\nO etc. This is considered\n\nas evidence of atom-like shell structure in nuclei.\n\n7. Electrons and positron are a particle-antiparticle pair. They are\n\nidentical in mass; their charges are equal in magnitude and opposite.\n\n( It is found that when an electron and a positron come together, they\n\nannihilate each other giving energy in the form of gamma-ray photons.)\n\n8. In â\n-\n-decay (electron emission), the particle emitted along with electron\n\nis anti-neutrino (ν ). On the other hand, the particle emitted in β\n+\n-\n\ndecay (positron emission) is neutrino (ν). Neutrino and anti-neutrino\n\nare a particle-antiparticle pair. There are anti particles associated\n\nwith every particle. What should be antiproton which is the anti\n\nparticle of the proton?\n\n9. A free neutron is unstable ( –n p e ν→ + + ). But a similar free proton\ndecay is not possible, since a proton is (slightly) lighter than a neutron.\n\n10. Gamma emission usually follows alpha or beta emission. A nucleus\n\nin an excited (higher) state goes to a lower state by emitting a gamma\n\nphoton. A nucleus may be left in an excited state after alpha or beta\n\nemission. Successive emission of gamma rays from the same nucleus\n\n(as in case of \n60\n\nNi, Fig. 13.4) is a clear proof that nuclei also have\n\ndiscrete energy levels as do the atoms.\n\n11. Radioactivity is an indication of the instability of nuclei. Stability\n\nrequires the ratio of neutron to proton to be around 1:1 for light\n\nnuclei. This ratio increases to about 3:2 for heavy nuclei. (More\n\nneutrons are required to overcome the effect of repulsion among the\n\nprotons.) Nuclei which are away from the stability ratio, i.e., nuclei\n\nwhich have an excess of neutrons  or protons are unstable. In fact,\n\nonly about 10% of knon isotopes (of all elements), are stable. Others\n\nhave been either artificially produced in the laboratory by bombarding\n\nα, p, d, n or other particles on targets of stable nuclear species or\n\nidentified in astronomical observations of matter in the universe.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n462\n\nEXERCISES\n\nYou may find the following data useful in solving the exercises:\n\ne = 1.6×10\n–19\n\nC N = 6.023×10\n23\n\n per mole\n1/(4πε\n\n0\n) = 9 × 109 N m2/C2 k = 1.381×10–23J K–1\n\n1 MeV = 1.6×10\n–13\n\nJ 1 u = 931.5 MeV/c\n2\n\n1 year = 3.154×107 s\n\nm\nH\n\n= 1.007825 u m\nn\n\n= 1.008665 u\n\nm( 4\n2He ) = 4.002603 u me = 0.000548 u\n\n13.1 (a) Two stable isotopes of lithium 6\n3 Li  and \n\n7\n3 Li  have respective\n\nabundances of 7.5% and 92.5%.

Before the discovery of\ntransistor in 1948, such devices were mostly vacuum tubes (also called\nvalves) like the vacuum diode which has two electrodes, viz., anode (often\ncalled plate) and cathode; triode which has three electrodes – cathode,\nplate and grid; tetrode and pentode (respectively with 4 and 5 electrodes).\nIn a vacuum tube, the electrons are supplied by a heated cathode and\nthe controlled flow of these electrons in vacuum is obtained by varying\nthe voltage between its different electrodes. Vacuum is required in the\ninter-electrode space; otherwise the moving electrons may lose their\nenergy on collision with the air molecules in their path. In these devices\nthe electrons can flow only from the cathode to the anode (i.e., only in one\ndirection). Therefore, such devices are generally referred to as valves.\nThese vacuum tube devices are bulky, consume high power, operate\ngenerally at high voltages (~100 V) and have limited life and low reliability.\nThe seed of the development of modern solid-state semiconductor\nelectronics goes back to 1930’s when it was realised that some solid-\nstate semiconductors and their junctions offer the possibility of controlling\nthe number and the direction of flow of charge carriers through them.\nSimple excitations like light, heat or small applied voltage can change\nthe number of mobile charges in a semiconductor. Note that the supply\n\nChapter Fourteen\n\nSEMICONDUCTOR\nELECTRONICS:\nMATERIALS, DEVICES\n\nAND SIMPLE CIRCUITS\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n468\n\nand flow of charge carriers in the semiconductor devices are within the\nsolid itself, while in the earlier vacuum tubes/valves, the mobile electrons\nwere obtained from a heated cathode and they were made to flow in an\nevacuated space or vacuum. No external heating or large evacuated space\nis required by the semiconductor devices. They are small in size, consume\nlow power, operate at low voltages and have long life and high reliability.\nEven the Cathode Ray Tubes (CRT) used in television and computer\nmonitors which work on the principle of vacuum tubes are being replaced\nby Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) monitors with supporting solid state\nelectronics. Much before the full implications of the semiconductor devices\nwas formally understood, a naturally occurring crystal of galena (Lead\nsulphide, PbS) with a metal point contact attached to it was used as\ndetector of radio waves.\n\nIn the following sections, we will introduce the basic concepts of\nsemiconductor physics and discuss some semiconductor devices like\njunction diodes (a 2-electrode device) and bipolar junction transistor (a\n3-electrode device). A few circuits illustrating their applications will also\nbe described.\n\n14.2 CLASSIFICATION OF METALS, CONDUCTORS AND\nSEMICONDUCTORS\n\nOn the basis of conductivity\nOn the basis of the relative values of electrical conductivity (σ ) or resistivity\n(ρ = 1/σ ), the solids are broadly classified as:\n(i) Metals: They possess very low resistivity (or high conductivity).\n\nρ ~ 10–2 – 10–8 Ω m\nσ ~ 102 – 108 S m–1\n\n(ii) Semiconductors: They have resistivity or conductivity intermediate\nto metals and insulators.\nρ ~ 10–5 – 106 Ω m\nσ ~ 105 – 10–6 S m–1\n\n(iii)Insulators: They have high resistivity (or low conductivity).\nρ ~ 1011 – 1019 Ω m\nσ ~ 10–11 – 10–19 S m–1\n\nThe values of ρ and σ given above are indicative of magnitude and\ncould well go outside the ranges as well. Relative values of the resistivity\nare not the only criteria for distinguishing metals, insulators and\nsemiconductors from each other. There are some other differences, which\nwill become clear as we go along in this chapter.\n\nOur interest in this chapter is in the study of semiconductors which\ncould be:\n(i) Elemental semiconductors: Si and Ge\n(ii) Compound semiconductors: Examples are:\n\n• Inorganic: CdS, GaAs, CdSe, InP, etc.\n• Organic: anthracene, doped pthalocyanines, etc.\n• Organic polymers:  polypyrrole, polyaniline, polythiophene, etc.\nMost of the currently available semiconductor devices are based on\n\nelemental semiconductors Si or Ge and compound inorganic\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n469\n\nSemiconductor Electronics:\n\nMaterials, Devices and\n\nSimple Circuits\n\nsemiconductors. However, after 1990, a few semiconductor devices using\norganic semiconductors and semiconducting polymers have been\ndeveloped signalling the birth of a futuristic technology of polymer-\nelectronics and molecular-electronics. In this chapter, we will restrict\nourselves to the study of inorganic semiconductors, particularly\nelemental semiconductors Si and Ge. The general concepts introduced\nhere for discussing the elemental semiconductors, by-and-large, apply\nto most of the compound semiconductors as well.\n\nOn the basis of energy bands\n\nAccording to the Bohr atomic model, in an isolated atom the energy of\nany of its electrons is decided by the orbit in which it revolves. But when\nthe atoms come together to form a solid they are close to each other. So\nthe outer orbits of electrons from neighbouring atoms would come very\nclose or could even overlap. This would make the nature of electron motion\nin a solid very different from that in an isolated atom.\n\nInside the crystal each electron has a unique position and no two\nelectrons see exactly the same pattern of surrounding charges. Because\nof this, each electron will have a different energy level. These different\nenergy levels with continuous energy variation form what are called\nenergy bands.  The energy band which includes the energy levels of the\nvalence electrons is called the valence band. The energy band above the\nvalence band is called the conduction band. With no external energy, all\nthe valence electrons will reside in the valence band. If the lowest level in\nthe conduction band happens to be lower than the highest level of the\nvalence band, the electrons from the valence band can easily move into\nthe conduction band. Normally the conduction band is empty. But when\nit overlaps on the valence band electrons can move freely into it. This is\nthe case with metallic conductors.\n\nIf there is some gap between the conduction band and the valence\nband, electrons in the valence band all remain bound and no free electrons\nare available in the conduction band. This makes the material an\ninsulator. But some of the electrons from the valence band may gain\nexternal energy to cross the gap between the conduction band and the\nvalence band. Then these electrons will move into the conduction band.\nAt the same time they will create vacant energy levels in the valence band\nwhere other valence electrons can move. Thus the process creates the\npossibility of conduction due to electrons in conduction band as well as\ndue to vacancies in the valence band.\n\nLet us consider what happens in the case of Si or Ge crystal containing\nN atoms. For Si, the outermost orbit is the third orbit (n = 3), while for Ge\nit is the fourth orbit (n = 4). The number of electrons in the outermost\norbit is 4 (2s and 2p electrons). Hence, the total number of outer electrons\nin the crystal is 4N. The maximum possible number of electrons in the\nouter orbit is 8 (2s + 6p electrons). So, for the 4N valence electrons there\nare 8N available energy states. These 8N discrete energy levels can either\nform a continuous band or they may be grouped in different bands\ndepending upon the distance between the atoms in the crystal (see box\non Band Theory of Solids).\n\nAt the distance between the atoms in the crystal lattices of Si and Ge,\nthe energy band of these 8N states is split apart into two which are\nseparated by an energy gap E\n\ng\n (Fig. 14.1). The lower band which is\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n470\n\ncompletely occupied by the 4N valence electrons at temperature of absolute\nzero is the valence band.  The other band consisting of 4N energy states,\ncalled the conduction band, is completely empty at absolute zero.\n\nBAND THEORY OF SOLIDS\n\nConsider that the Si or Ge crystal\ncontains N atoms. Electrons of each\natom will have discrete energies in\ndifferent orbits. The electron energy\nwill be same if all the atoms are\nisolated, i.e., separated from each\nother by a large distance. However,\nin a crystal, the atoms are close to\neach other (2 to 3 Å) and therefore\nthe electrons interact with each\nother and also with the\nneighbouring atomic cores. The\noverlap (or interaction) will be more\nfelt by the electrons in the\noutermost orbit while the inner\norbit or core electron energies may\n\nremain unaffected. Therefore, for understanding electron energies in Si or Ge crystal, we\nneed to consider the changes in the energies of the electrons in the outermost orbit only.\nFor Si, the outermost orbit is the third orbit (n = 3), while  for Ge it is the fourth orbit\n(n = 4). The number of electrons in the outermost orbit is 4 (2s and 2p electrons). Hence,\nthe total number of outer electrons in the crystal is 4N. The maximum possible number of\nouter electrons in the orbit is 8 (2s + 6p electrons). So, out of the 4N electrons, 2N electrons\nare in the 2N s-states (orbital quantum number l = 0) and 2N electrons are in the available\n6N p-states. Obviously, some p-electron states are empty as shown in the extreme right of\nFigure. This is the case of well separated or isolated atoms [region A of Figure].\n\nSuppose these atoms start coming nearer to each other to form a solid. The energies\nof these electrons in the outermost orbit may change (both increase and decrease) due to\nthe interaction between the electrons of different atoms. The 6N states for l = 1, which\noriginally had identical energies in the isolated atoms, spread out and form an energy\nband [region B in Figure]. Similarly, the 2N states for l = 0, having identical energies in\nthe isolated atoms, split into a second band (carefully see the region B of Figure) separated\nfrom the first one by an energy gap.\n\nAt still smaller spacing, however, there comes a region in which the bands merge with\neach other. The lowest energy state that is a split from the upper atomic level appears to\ndrop below the upper state that has come from the lower atomic level. In this region (region\nC in Figure), no energy gap exists where the upper and lower energy states get mixed.\n\nFinally, if the distance between the atoms further decreases, the energy bands again\nsplit apart and are separated by an energy gap E\n\ng\n (region D in Figure). The total number\n\nof available energy states 8N has been re-apportioned between the two bands (4N states\neach in the lower and upper energy bands). Here the significant point is that there are\nexactly as many states in the lower band (4N ) as there are available valence electrons\nfrom the  atoms (4N ).\n\nTherefore, this band (called the valence band ) is completely filled while the upper\nband is completely empty. The upper band is called the conduction band.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n471\n\nSemiconductor Electronics:\n\nMaterials, Devices and\n\nSimple Circuits\n\nThe lowest energy level in the\nconduction band is shown as E\n\nC\n and\n\nhighest energy level in the valence band\nis shown as E\n\nV\n. Above E\n\nC\n and below E\n\nV\n\nthere are a large number of closely spaced\nenergy levels, as shown in Fig. 14.1.\n\nThe gap between the top of the  valence\nband and bottom of the conduction band\nis called the energy band gap (Energy gap\nE\n\ng\n). It may be large, small, or zero,\n\ndepending upon the material. These\ndifferent situations, are depicted in Fig.\n14.2 and discussed below:\nCase I: This refers to a situation, as\nshown in Fig. 14.2(a). One can have a\nmetal either when the conduction band\nis partially filled and the balanced band\nis partially empty or when the conduction\nand valance bands overlap. When there\nis overlap electrons from valence band can\neasily move into the conduction band.\nThis situation makes a  large number of\nelectrons available for electrical conduction. When the valence band is\npartially empty, electrons from its lower level can move to higher level\nmaking conduction possible. Therefore, the resistance of such materials\nis low or the conductivity is high.\n\nFIGURE 14.2 Difference between energy bands of (a) metals,\n(b) insulators and (c) semiconductors.\n\nFIGURE 14.1 The energy band positions in a\nsemiconductor at 0 K. The upper band, called the\n\nconduction band, consists of infinitely large number\nof closely spaced energy states. The lower band,\n\ncalled the valence band, consists of closely spaced\ncompletely filled energy states.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n472\n\nCase II: In this case, as shown in Fig. 14.2(b), a large band gap E\ng\n exists\n\n(E\ng\n > 3 eV). There are no electrons in the conduction band, and therefore\n\nno electrical conduction is possible. Note that the energy gap is so large\nthat electrons cannot be excited from the valence band  to the conduction\nband by thermal excitation. This is the case of insulators.\nCase III: This situation is shown in Fig. 14.2(c). Here a finite but small\nband gap (E\n\ng\n < 3 eV) exists. Because of the small band gap, at room\n\ntemperature some electrons from valence band can acquire enough\nenergy to cross the energy gap and enter the  conduction band. These\nelectrons (though small in numbers) can move in the conduction band.\nHence, the resistance of semiconductors is not as high as that of the\ninsulators.\n\nIn this section we have made a broad classification of metals,\nconductors and semiconductors. In the section which follows you will\nlearn the conduction process in semiconductors.\n\n14.3  INTRINSIC SEMICONDUCTOR\nWe shall take the most common case of Ge and Si whose lattice structure\nis shown in Fig. 14.3. These structures are called the  diamond-like\nstructures. Each atom is surrounded by four nearest neighbours. We\nknow that Si and Ge have four valence electrons. In its crystalline\nstructure, every Si or Ge atom tends to share one of its four valence\nelectrons with each of its four nearest neighbour atoms, and also to take\nshare of one electron from each such neighbour. These shared electron\npairs are referred to as forming a  covalent bond or simply a valence\nbond. The two shared electrons can be assumed to shuttle back-and-\nforth between the associated atoms holding them together strongly.\nFigure 14.4 schematically shows the 2-dimensional representation of Si\nor Ge structure shown in Fig. 14.3 which overemphasises the covalent\nbond. It shows an idealised picture in which no bonds are broken (all\n\nbonds are intact). Such a situation arises at low\ntemperatures. As the temperature increases, more\nthermal energy becomes available to these electrons\nand some of these electrons may break–away\n(becoming free electrons contributing to conduction).\nThe thermal energy effectively ionises only a few atoms\nin the crystalline lattice and creates a vacancy in the\nbond as shown in Fig. 14.5(a). The neighbourhood,\nfrom which the free electron (with charge –q ) has come\nout leaves a vacancy with an effective charge (+q ). This\nvacancy with the effective positive electronic charge is\ncalled a hole. The hole behaves as an apparent free\nparticle with effective positive charge.\n\nIn intrinsic semiconductors, the number of free\nelectrons, n\n\ne \nis equal to the number of holes, n\n\nh\n.  That is\n\nn\ne\n = n\n\nh\n = n\n\ni\n(14.1)\n\nwhere n\ni\n is called intrinsic carrier concentration.\n\nSemiconductors posses the unique property in\nwhich, apart from electrons, the holes also move.\n\nFIGURE 14.3 Three-dimensional dia-\nmond-like crystal structure for Carbon,\n\nSilicon or Germanium with\nrespective lattice spacing a equal\n\nto 3.56, 5.43 and 5.66 Å.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n473\n\nSemiconductor Electronics:\n\nMaterials, Devices and\n\nSimple Circuits\n\nSuppose there is a hole at site 1 as shown in\nFig. 14.5(a). The movement of holes can be\nvisualised as shown in Fig. 14.5(b). An electron\nfrom the covalent bond at site 2 may jump to\nthe vacant site 1 (hole). Thus, after such a jump,\nthe hole is at site 2 and the site 1 has now an\nelectron. Therefore, apparently, the hole has\nmoved from site 1 to site 2. Note that the electron\noriginally set free [Fig. 14.5(a)] is not involved\nin this process of hole motion. The free electron\nmoves completely independently as conduction\nelectron and gives rise to an electron current, I\n\ne\n\nunder an applied electric field. Remember that\nthe motion of hole is only a convenient way of\ndescribing the actual motion of bound electrons,\nwhenever there is an empty bond anywhere in\nthe crystal. Under the action of an electric field,\nthese holes move towards negative potential\ngiving the hole current, I\n\nh\n. The total current, I is\n\nthus the sum of the electron current I\ne\n and the\n\nhole current I\nh\n:\n\nI = I\ne\n + I\n\nh\n(14.2)\n\nIt may be noted that apart from the process of generation of conduction\nelectrons and holes, a simultaneous process of recombination occurs in\nwhich the electrons recombine with the holes. At equilibrium, the rate of\ngeneration is equal to the rate of recombination of charge carriers. The\nrecombination occurs due to an electron colliding with a hole.\n\nFIGURE 14.4 Schematic two-dimensional\nrepresentation of Si or Ge structure showing\n\ncovalent bonds at low temperature\n(all bonds intact). +4 symbol\n\nindicates inner cores of Si or Ge.\n\nFIGURE 14.5 (a) Schematic model of generation of hole at site 1 and conduction electron\ndue to thermal energy at moderate temperatures. (b) Simplified representation of\n\npossible thermal motion of a hole. The electron from the lower left hand covalent bond\n(site 2) goes to the earlier hole site1, leaving a hole at its site indicating an\n\napparent movement of the hole from site 1 to site 2.\n\n(a) (b)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n474\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n4\n.1\n\nAn intrinsic semiconductor\nwill behave like an insulator at\nT = 0 K as shown in Fig. 14.6(a).\nIt is the thermal energy at\nhigher temperatures (T > 0K),\nwhich excites some electrons\nfrom the valence band to the\nconduction band. These\nthermally excited electrons at\nT > 0 K, partially occupy the\nconduction band. Therefore,\nthe energy-band diagram of an\nintrinsic semiconductor will be\nas shown in Fig. 14.6(b). Here,\nsome electrons are shown in\nthe conduction band. These\nhave come from the valence\nband leaving equal number of\nholes there.\n\nExample 14.1 C, Si and Ge have same lattice structure. Why is C\ninsulator while Si and Ge intrinsic semiconductors?\n\nSolution  The 4 bonding electrons of C, Si or Ge lie, respectively, in\nthe second, third and fourth orbit.  Hence, energy required to take\nout an electron from these atoms (i.e., ionisation energy E\n\ng\n) will be\n\nleast for Ge, followed by Si and highest for C. Hence, number of free\nelectrons for conduction in Ge and Si are significant but negligibly\nsmall for C.\n\n14.4  EXTRINSIC SEMICONDUCTOR\nThe conductivity of an intrinsic semiconductor depends on its\ntemperature, but at room temperature its conductivity is very low. As\nsuch, no important electronic devices can be developed using these\nsemiconductors. Hence there is a necessity of improving their\nconductivity. This can be done by making use of impurities.\n\nWhen a small amount, say, a few parts per million (ppm), of a suitable\nimpurity is added to the pure semiconductor, the conductivity of the\nsemiconductor is increased manifold. Such materials are known as\nextrinsic semiconductors or impurity semiconductors. The deliberate\naddition of a desirable impurity is called doping and the impurity atoms\nare called dopants. Such a material is also called a doped semiconductor.\nThe dopant has to be such that it does not distort the original pure\nsemiconductor lattice. It occupies only a very few of the original\nsemiconductor atom sites in the crystal. A necessary condition to attain\nthis is that the sizes of the dopant and the semiconductor atoms should\nbe nearly the same.\n\nThere are two types of dopants used in doping the tetravalent Si\nor Ge:\n(i) Pentavalent (valency 5); like Arsenic (As), Antimony (Sb), Phosphorous\n\n(P), etc.\n\nFIGURE 14.6 (a)  An intrinsic semiconductor at T = 0 K\nbehaves like insulator. (b)  At T > 0 K, four thermally generated\n\nelectron-hole pairs. The filled circles ( ) represent electrons\nand empty circles ( ) represent holes.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n475\n\nSemiconductor Electronics:\n\nMaterials, Devices and\n\nSimple Circuits\n\n(ii) Trivalent (valency 3); like Indium (In),\nBoron (B), Aluminium (Al), etc.\nWe shall now discuss how the doping\n\nchanges the number of charge carriers (and\nhence the conductivity) of semiconductors.\nSi or Ge belongs to the fourth group in the\nPeriodic table and, therefore, we choose the\ndopant element from nearby fifth or third\ngroup, expecting and taking care that the\nsize of the dopant atom is nearly the same as\nthat of Si or Ge. Interestingly, the pentavalent\nand trivalent dopants in Si or Ge give two\nentirely different types of semiconductors as\ndiscussed below.\n\n(i)  n-type semiconductor\n\nSuppose we dope Si or Ge with a pentavalent\nelement as shown in Fig. 14.7. When an atom\nof  +5 valency element  occupies the position\nof an atom in the crystal lattice of Si, four of\nits electrons bond with the four silicon\nneighbours while the fifth remains very\nweakly bound to its parent atom. This is\nbecause the four electrons participating in\nbonding are seen as part of the effective core\nof the atom by the fifth electron. As a result\nthe ionisation energy required to set this\nelectron free is very small and even at room\ntemperature it will be free to move in the\nlattice of the semiconductor. For example, the\nenergy required is ~ 0.01 eV for germanium,\nand 0.05 eV for silicon, to separate this\nelectron from its atom. This is in contrast to the energy required to jump\nthe forbidden band (about 0.72 eV for germanium and about 1.1 eV for\nsilicon) at room temperature in the intrinsic semiconductor.  Thus, the\npentavalent dopant is donating one extra electron for conduction and\nhence is known as donor impurity. The number of electrons made\navailable for conduction by dopant atoms depends strongly upon the\ndoping level and is independent of any increase in ambient temperature.\nOn the other hand, the number of free electrons (with an equal number\nof holes) generated by Si atoms, increases weakly with temperature.\n\nIn a doped semiconductor the total number of conduction electrons\nn\n\ne\n is due to the electrons contributed by donors and those generated\n\nintrinsically, while the total number of holes n\nh\n is only due to the holes\n\nfrom the intrinsic source. But the rate of recombination of holes would\nincrease due to the increase in the number of electrons. As a result, the\nnumber of holes would get reduced further.\n\nThus, with proper level of doping the number of conduction electrons\ncan be made much larger than the number of holes. Hence in an extrinsic\n\nFIGURE 14.7 (a) Pentavalent donor atom (As, Sb,\nP, etc.) doped for tetravalent Si or Ge giving n-\ntype semiconductor, and (b) Commonly used\nschematic representation of n-type material\n\nwhich shows only the fixed cores of the\nsubstituent donors with one additional effective\npositive charge and its associated extra electron.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n476\n\nsemiconductor doped with pentavalent impurity, electrons\nbecome the majority carriers and holes the minority carriers.\nThese semiconductors are, therefore, known as n-type\nsemiconductors. For n-type semiconductors, we have,\n\nn\ne\n >> n\n\nh\n(14.3)\n\n(ii)  p-type semiconductor\n\nThis is obtained when Si or Ge is doped with a trivalent impurity\nlike Al, B, In, etc. The dopant has one valence electron less than\nSi or Ge and, therefore, this atom can form covalent bonds with\nneighbouring three Si atoms but does not have any electron to\noffer to the fourth Si atom. So the bond between the fourth\nneighbour and the trivalent atom has a vacancy or hole as shown\nin Fig. 14.8. Since the neighbouring Si atom in the lattice wants\nan electron in place of a hole, an electron  in the outer orbit of\nan atom in the neighbourhood may jump to fill this vacancy,\nleaving a vacancy or hole at its own site. Thus the hole is\navailable for conduction. Note that the trivalent foreign atom\nbecomes effectively negatively charged when it shares fourth\nelectron with neighbouring Si atom. Therefore, the dopant atom\nof p-type material can be treated as core of one negative charge\nalong with its associated hole as shown in Fig. 14.8(b). It is\nobvious that one acceptor atom gives one hole. These holes are\nin addition to the intrinsically generated holes while the source\nof conduction electrons is only intrinsic generation. Thus, for\nsuch a material, the holes are the majority carriers and electrons\nare minority carriers. Therefore, extrinsic semiconductors doped\nwith trivalent impurity are called p-type semiconductors. For\np-type semiconductors, the recombination process will reduce\nthe number (n\n\ni\n)of intrinsically generated electrons to n\n\ne\n.  We\n\nhave, for p-type semiconductors\n\nn\nh\n >> n\n\ne\n(14.4)\n\nNote that the crystal maintains an overall charge neutrality\nas the charge of additional charge carriers is just equal and\n\nopposite to that of the ionised cores in the lattice.\n\nIn extrinsic semiconductors, because of the abundance of\nmajority current carriers, the minority carriers produced\nthermally have more chance of meeting majority carriers and\n\nthus getting destroyed. Hence, the dopant, by adding a large number of\ncurrent carriers of one type, which become the majority carriers, indirectly\nhelps to reduce the intrinsic concentration of minority carriers.\n\nThe semiconductor’s energy band structure is affected by doping. In\nthe case of extrinsic semiconductors, additional energy states due to donor\nimpurities (E\n\nD\n) and acceptor impurities (E\n\nA\n) also exist. In the energy band\n\ndiagram of n-type Si semiconductor, the donor energy level E\nD\n is slightly\n\nbelow the bottom E\nC\n of the conduction band and electrons from this level\n\nmove into the conduction band with very small supply of energy. At room\ntemperature, most of the donor atoms get ionised but very few (~1012)\natoms of Si get ionised.  So the conduction band will have most electrons\ncoming from the donor impurities, as shown in Fig. 14.9(a). Similarly,\n\nFIGURE 14.8 (a) Trivalent\nacceptor atom (In, Al, B etc.)\ndoped in tetravalent Si or Ge\nlattice giving p-type semicon-\nductor.

With very small\n\nsupply of energy an electron from the valence band can jump to the level\nE\n\nA\n and ionise the acceptor negatively. (Alternately, we can also say that\n\nwith very small supply of energy the hole from level E\nA\n sinks down into\n\nthe valence band. Electrons rise up and holes fall down when they gain\nexternal energy.) At room temperature, most of the acceptor atoms get\nionised leaving holes in the valence band. Thus at room temperature the\ndensity of holes in the valence band is predominantly due to impurity in\nthe extrinsic semiconductor. The electron and hole concentration in a\nsemiconductor in thermal equilibrium is given by\n\nn\ne\nn\n\nh\n = n\n\ni\n\n2 (14.5)\n\nThough the above description is grossly approximate and\nhypothetical, it helps in understanding the difference between metals,\ninsulators and semiconductors (extrinsic and intrinsic) in a simple\nmanner. The difference in the resistivity of C, Si and Ge depends upon\nthe energy gap between their conduction and valence bands. For C\n(diamond), Si and Ge, the energy gaps are 5.4 eV, 1.1 eV and 0.7 eV,\nrespectively. Sn also is a group IV element but it is a metal because the\nenergy gap in its case  is 0 eV.\n\nFIGURE 14.9 Energy bands of (a) n-type semiconductor at T > 0K, (b) p-type\nsemiconductor at T > 0K.\n\nExample 14.2 Suppose a pure Si crystal has 5 × 1028 atoms m–3.

By adding\nprecisely a small quantity of pentavelent impurity, part of the p-Si wafer\ncan be converted into n-Si. There are several processes by which a\nsemiconductor can be formed. The wafer now contains p-region and\nn-region and a metallurgical junction between p-, and n- region.\n\nTwo important processes occur during the formation of a p-n junction:\ndiffusion and drift. We know that in an n-type semiconductor, the\nconcentration of electrons (number of electrons per unit volume) is more\ncompared to the concentration of holes. Similarly, in a p-type\nsemiconductor, the concentration of holes is more than the concentration\nof electrons. During the formation of p-n junction, and due to the\nconcentration gradient across p-, and n- sides, holes diffuse from p-side\nto n-side (p → n) and electrons diffuse from n-side to p-side (n → p). This\nmotion of charge carries gives rise to diffusion current across the junction.\n\nWhen an electron diffuses from n → p, it leaves behind an ionised\ndonor on n-side. This ionised donor (positive charge) is immobile as it is\nbonded to the surrounding atoms. As the electrons continue to diffuse\nfrom n → p, a layer of positive charge (or positive space-charge region) on\nn-side of the junction is developed.\n\nSimilarly, when a hole diffuses from p → n due to the concentration\ngradient, it leaves behind an ionised acceptor (negative charge) which is\nimmobile. As the holes continue to diffuse, a layer of negative charge (or\nnegative space-charge region) on the p-side of the junction is developed.\nThis space-charge region on either side of the junction together is known\nas depletion region as the electrons and holes  taking part in the initial\n\nmovement across the junction depleted the region of its\nfree charges (Fig. 14.10). The thickness of depletion region\nis of the order of one-tenth of a micrometre. Due to the\npositive space-charge region on n-side of the junction and\nnegative space charge region on p-side of the junction,\nan electric field directed from positive charge towards\nnegative charge develops. Due to this field, an electron on\np-side of the junction moves to n-side and a hole on n-\nside of the junction moves to p-side. The motion of charge\ncarriers due to the electric field is called drift.  Thus a\ndrift current, which is opposite in direction to the diffusion\ncurrent (Fig. 14.10) starts.\n\nFIGURE 14.10 p-n junction\nformation process.\n\nF\no\n\nrm\na\nti\no\nn\n a\n\nn\nd\n w\n\no\nrk\n\nin\ng\n\n o\nf \n\np\n-n\n\n j\nu\nn\nc\nti\no\nn\n d\n\nio\nd\ne\n\nh\ntt\np\n:/\n/h\n\ny\np\ne\nrp\n\nh\ny\nsi\n\nc\ns.\n\np\nh\ny\n-a\n\nst\nr.\ng\nsu\n\n.e\nd\nu\n/h\n\nb\na\nse\n\n/s\no\nli\nd\ns/\n\np\nn\nju\n\nn\n.h\n\ntm\nl\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n479\n\nSemiconductor Electronics:\n\nMaterials, Devices and\n\nSimple Circuits\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n4\n.3\n\nInitially, diffusion current is large and drift current is small.\nAs the diffusion process continues, the space-charge regions\non either side of the junction extend, thus increasing the electric\nfield strength  and hence drift current. This process continues\nuntil the diffusion current equals the drift current. Thus a p-n\njunction is formed. In a p-n junction under equilibrium there\nis no net current.\n\nThe loss of electrons from the n-region and the gain of\nelectron by the p-region causes a  difference of potential across\nthe junction of the two regions. The polarity of this potential is\nsuch as to oppose further flow of carriers so that a condition of\nequilibrium exists. Figure 14.11 shows the p-n junction at\nequilibrium and the potential across the junction. The\nn-material has lost electrons, and p material has acquired\nelectrons. The n material is thus positive relative to the p\nmaterial. Since this potential tends to prevent the movement of\nelectron from the n region into the p region, it is often called a\nbarrier potential.\n\nExample 14.3  Can we take one slab of p-type semiconductor and\nphysically join it to another n-type semiconductor to get p-n junction?\n\nSolution  No! Any slab, howsoever flat, will have roughness much\nlarger than the inter-atomic crystal spacing (~2 to 3 Å) and hence\ncontinuous contact at the atomic level will not be possible. The junction\nwill behave as a discontinuity for the flowing charge carriers.\n\n14.6  SEMICONDUCTOR DIODE\nA semiconductor diode [Fig. 14.12(a)] is basically a\np-n junction with metallic contacts provided at the\nends for the application of an external voltage. It is a\ntwo terminal device. A p-n junction diode is\nsymbolically represented as shown in Fig. 14.12(b).\n\nThe direction of arrow indicates the conventional\ndirection of current (when the diode is under forward\nbias). The equilibrium barrier potential can be altered\nby applying an external voltage V across the diode.\nThe situation of p-n junction diode under equilibrium\n(without bias) is shown in Fig. 14.11(a) and (b).\n\n14.6.1  p-n junction diode under forward bias\n\nWhen an external voltage V is applied across a semiconductor diode such\nthat p-side is connected to the positive terminal of the battery and n-side\nto the negative terminal [Fig. 14.13(a)], it is said to be forward biased.\n\nThe applied voltage mostly drops across the depletion region and the\nvoltage drop across the p-side and n-side of the junction is negligible.\n(This is because the resistance of the depletion region – a region where\nthere are no charges – is very high compared to the resistance of  n-side\nand p-side.) The direction of the applied voltage (V ) is opposite to the\n\nFIGURE 14.11 (a) Diode under\nequilibrium (V = 0), (b) Barrier\n\npotential under no bias.\n\nFIGURE 14.12 (a) Semiconductor diode,\n(b) Symbol for p-n junction diode.\n\nnp\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n480\n\nbuilt-in potential V\n0\n. As a result, the depletion layer width\n\ndecreases and the barrier height is reduced [Fig. 14.13(b)]. The\neffective barrier height under forward bias is (V\n\n0\n – V ).\n\nIf the applied voltage is small, the barrier potential will be\nreduced only slightly below the equilibrium value, and only a\nsmall number of carriers in the material—those that happen to\nbe in the uppermost energy levels—will possess enough energy\nto cross the junction. So the current will be small. If we increase\nthe applied voltage significantly, the barrier height will be reduced\nand more number of carriers will have the required energy. Thus\nthe current increases.\n\nDue to the applied voltage, electrons from n-side cross the\ndepletion region and reach p-side (where they are minority\ncarries). Similarly, holes from p-side cross the junction and reach\nthe n-side (where they are minority carries). This process under\nforward bias is known as minority carrier injection. At the\njunction boundary, on each side, the minority carrier\nconcentration increases significantly compared to the locations\nfar from the junction.\n\nDue to this concentration gradient, the injected electrons on\np-side diffuse from the junction edge of p-side to the other end\nof p-side. Likewise, the injected holes on n-side diffuse from the\n\njunction edge of n-side to the other end of n-side\n(Fig. 14.14). This motion of charged carriers on either side\ngives rise to current. The total diode forward current is sum\nof hole diffusion current and conventional current due to\nelectron diffusion. The magnitude of this current is usually\nin mA.\n\n14.6.2  p-n junction diode under reverse bias\n\nWhen an external voltage (V ) is applied across the diode such\nthat n-side is positive and p-side is negative, it is said to be\nreverse biased [Fig.14.15(a)]. The applied voltage mostly\n\ndrops across the depletion region. The direction of applied voltage is same\nas the direction of barrier potential. As a result, the barrier height increases\nand the depletion region widens due to the change in the electric field.\nThe effective barrier height under reverse bias is (V0 + V ), [Fig. 14.15(b)].\nThis suppresses the flow of electrons from n → p and holes from p → n.\nThus, diffusion current, decreases enormously compared to the diode\nunder forward bias.\n\nThe electric field direction of the junction is such that if electrons on\np-side or holes on n-side in their random motion come close to the\njunction, they will be swept to its majority zone. This drift of carriers\ngives rise to current. The drift current is of the order of a few µA. This is\nquite low because it is due to the motion of carriers from their minority\nside to their majority side across the junction. The drift current is also\nthere under forward bias but it is negligible (µA) when compared with\ncurrent due to injected carriers which is usually in mA.\n\nThe diode reverse current is not very much dependent on the applied\nvoltage. Even a small voltage is sufficient to sweep the minority carriers\nfrom one side of the junction to the other side of the junction. The current\n\nFIGURE 14.13 (a) p-n\njunction diode under forward\n\nbias, (b) Barrier potential\n(1) without battery, (2) Low\n\nbattery voltage, and (3) High\nvoltage battery.\n\nFIGURE 14.14 Forward bias\nminority carrier injection.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n481\n\nSemiconductor Electronics:\n\nMaterials, Devices and\n\nSimple Circuits\n\nis not limited by the magnitude of the applied voltage but is\nlimited due to the concentration of the minority carrier on either\nside of the junction.\n\nThe current under reverse bias is essentially voltage\nindependent upto a critical reverse bias voltage, known as\nbreakdown voltage (V\n\nbr\n). When V = V\n\nbr\n, the diode reverse current\n\nincreases sharply. Even a slight increase in the bias voltage causes\nlarge change in the current. If the reverse current is not limited by\nan external circuit below the rated value (specified by the\nmanufacturer) the p-n junction will get destroyed. Once it exceeds\nthe rated value, the diode gets destroyed due to overheating. This\ncan happen even for the diode under forward bias, if the forward\ncurrent exceeds the rated value.\n\nThe circuit arrangement for studying the V-I characteristics\nof a diode, (i.e., the variation of current as a function of applied\nvoltage) are shown in Fig. 14.16(a) and (b). The battery is connected\nto the diode through a potentiometer (or reheostat) so that the\napplied voltage to the diode can be changed. For different values\nof voltages, the value of the current is noted. A graph between V\nand I is obtained as in Fig. 14.16(c). Note that in forward bias\nmeasurement, we use a milliammeter since the expected current is large\n(as explained in the earlier section) while a micrometer is used in reverse\nbias to measure the current. You can see in Fig. 14.16(c) that in forward\n\nFIGURE 14.15 (a) Diode\nunder reverse bias,\n\n(b) Barrier potential under\nreverse bias.\n\nFIGURE 14.16 Experimental circuit arrangement for studying V-I characteristics of\na p-n junction diode (a) in forward bias, (b) in reverse bias.

After the characteristic\nvoltage, the diode current increases significantly (exponentially), even for\na very small increase in the diode bias voltage. This voltage is called the\nthreshold voltage or cut-in voltage (~0.2V for germanium diode and\n~0.7 V for silicon diode).\n\nFor the diode in reverse bias, the current is very small (~µA) and almost\nremains constant with change in bias. It is called reverse saturation\ncurrent. However, for special cases, at very high reverse bias (break down\nvoltage), the current suddenly increases. This special action of the diode\nis discussed later in Section 14.8. The general purpose diode are not\nused beyond the reverse saturation current region.\n\nThe above discussion shows that the p-n junction diode primerly\nallows the flow of current only in one direction (forward bias). The forward\nbias resistance is low as compared to the reverse bias resistance. This\nproperty is used for rectification of ac voltages as discussed in the next\nsection. For diodes, we define a quantity called dynamic resistance as\nthe ratio of small change in voltage ∆V to a small change in current ∆I:\n\nd\n\nV\nr\n\nI\n\n∆\n=\n\n∆\n(14.6)\n\nExample 14.4 The V-I characteristic of a silicon diode is shown in\nthe Fig. 14.17.

So if an alternating voltage is\napplied across a diode the current flows only in that part of the cycle\nwhen the diode is forward biased. This property\nis used to rectify alternating voltages and the\ncircuit used for this purpose is called a rectifier.\n\nIf an alternating voltage is applied across a\ndiode in series with a load, a pulsating voltage will\nappear across the load only during the half cycles\nof the ac input during which the diode is forward\nbiased. Such rectifier circuit, as shown in\nFig. 14.18, is called a half-wave rectifier. The\nsecondary of a transformer supplies the desired\nac voltage across terminals A and B. When the\nvoltage at A is positive, the diode is forward biased\nand it conducts. When A is negative, the diode is\nreverse-biased and it does not conduct. The reverse\nsaturation current of a diode is negligible and can\nbe considered equal to zero for practical purposes.\n(The reverse breakdown voltage of the diode must\nbe sufficiently higher than the peak ac voltage at\nthe secondary of the transformer to protect the\ndiode from reverse breakdown.)\n\nTherefore, in the positive half-cycle of ac there\nis a current through the load resistor R\n\nL\n and we\n\nget an output voltage, as shown in Fig. 14.18(b),\nwhereas there is no current in the negative half-\ncycle. In the next positive half-cycle, again we get\nthe output voltage. Thus, the output voltage, though still varying, is\nrestricted to only one direction and is said to be rectified. Since the\nrectified output of this circuit is only for half of the input ac wave it is\ncalled as half-wave rectifier.\n\nThe circuit using two diodes, shown in Fig. 14.19(a), gives output\nrectified voltage corresponding to both the positive as well as negative\nhalf of the ac cycle. Hence, it is known as full-wave rectifier. Here the\np-side of the two diodes are connected to the ends of the secondary of the\ntransformer. The n-side of the diodes are connected together and the\noutput is taken between this common point of diodes and the midpoint\nof the secondary of the transformer. So for a full-wave rectifier the\nsecondary of the transformer is provided with a centre tapping and so it\nis called centre-tap transformer. As can be seen from Fig.14.19(c) the\nvoltage rectified by each diode is only half the total secondary voltage.\nEach diode rectifies only for half the cycle, but the two do so for alternate\ncycles. Thus, the output between their common terminals and the centre-\ntap of the transformer becomes a full-wave rectifier output. (Note that\nthere is another circuit of full wave rectifier which does not need a centre-\ntap transformer but needs four diodes.) Suppose the input voltage to A\n\nFIGURE 14.18 (a) Half-wave rectifier\ncircuit, (b) Input ac voltage and output\n\nvoltage waveforms from the rectifier circuit.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n484\n\nwith respect to the centre tap at any instant\nis positive. It is clear that, at that instant,\nvoltage at B being out of phase will be\nnegative as shown in Fig.14.19(b). So, diode\nD1 gets forward biased and conducts (while\nD\n\n2\n being reverse biased is not conducting).\n\nHence, during this positive half cycle we get\nan output current (and a output voltage\nacross the load resistor R\n\nL\n) as shown in\n\nFig.14.19(c). In the course of the ac cycle\nwhen the voltage at A becomes negative with\nrespect to centre tap, the voltage at B would\nbe positive. In this part of the cycle diode\nD\n\n1\n would not conduct but diode D\n\n2\n would,\n\ngiving an output current and output\nvoltage (across R\n\nL\n) during the negative half\n\ncycle of the input ac. Thus, we get output\nvoltage during both the positive as well as\nthe negative half of the cycle. Obviously,\nthis is a more efficient circuit for getting\nrectified voltage or current than the half-\nwave rectifier.\n\nThe rectified voltage is in the form of\npulses of the shape of half sinusoids.\nThough it is unidirectional it does not have\na steady value. To get steady dc output\nfrom the pulsating voltage normally a\ncapacitor is connected across the output\nterminals (parallel to the load R\n\nL\n). One can\n\nalso use an inductor in series with R\nL\n for\n\nthe same purpose. Since these additional\ncircuits appear to filter out the ac ripple\nand give a pure dc voltage, so they are\ncalled filters.\n\nNow we shall discuss the role of\ncapacitor in filtering. When the voltage\nacross the capacitor is rising, it gets\n\ncharged. If there is no external load, it remains charged to the peak voltage\nof the rectified output. When there is a load, it gets discharged through\nthe load and the voltage across it begins to fall. In the next half-cycle of\nrectified output it again gets charged to the peak value (Fig. 14.20). The\nrate of fall of the voltage across the capacitor depends inversely upon the\nproduct of capacitance C and the effective resistance R\n\nL\n used in the circuit\n\nand is called the time constant.  To make the time constant large value of\nC should be large. So capacitor input filters use large capacitors. The\noutput voltage obtained by using capacitor input filter is nearer to the\npeak voltage of the rectified voltage. This type of filter is most widely\nused in power supplies.\n\nFIGURE 14.19 (a) A Full-wave rectifier\ncircuit; (b) Input wave forms given to the\ndiode D1 at A and to the diode D2 at B;\n\n(c) Output waveform across the\nload R\n\nL\n connected in the full-wave\n\nrectifier circuit.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n485\n\nSemiconductor Electronics:\n\nMaterials, Devices and\n\nSimple Circuits\n\n14.8  SPECIAL PURPOSE p-n JUNCTION DIODES\nIn the section, we shall discuss some devices which are basically junction\ndiodes but are developed for different applications.\n\n14.8.1  Zener diode\n\nIt is a special purpose semiconductor diode, named after its inventor\nC. Zener. It is designed to operate under reverse bias in the breakdown\nregion and used as a voltage regulator. The symbol for Zener diode is\nshown in Fig. 14.21(a).\n\nZener diode is fabricated by heavily doping both p-, and\nn- sides of the junction. Due to this, depletion region formed\nis very thin (<10–6 m) and the electric field of the junction is\nextremely high (~5×106 V/m) even for a small reverse bias\nvoltage of about 5V. The I-V characteristics of a Zener diode is\nshown in Fig. 14.21(b). It is seen that when the applied reverse\nbias voltage(V ) reaches the breakdown voltage (V\n\nz\n) of the Zener\n\ndiode, there is a large change in the current. Note that after\nthe breakdown voltage V\n\nz\n, a large change in the current can\n\nbe produced by almost insignificant change in the reverse bias\nvoltage. In other words, Zener voltage remains constant, even\nthough current through the Zener diode varies over a wide\nrange. This property of the Zener diode is used for regulating\nsupply voltages so that they are constant.\n\nLet us understand how reverse current suddenly increases\nat the breakdown voltage. We know that reverse current is\ndue to the flow of electrons (minority carriers) from p → n and\nholes from n → p. As the reverse bias voltage is increased, the\nelectric field at the junction becomes significant. When the\nreverse bias voltage V =  V\n\nz\n, then the electric field strength is\n\nhigh enough to pull valence electrons from the host atoms on\nthe p-side which are accelerated to n-side. These electrons\naccount for high current observed at the breakdown. The\nemission of electrons from the host atoms due to the high\nelectric field is known as internal field emission or field\nionisation. The electric field required for field ionisation is of\nthe order of 106 V/m.\n\nFIGURE 14.20 (a) A full-wave rectifier with capacitor filter, (b) Input and output\nvoltage of rectifier in (a).\n\nFIGURE 14.21 Zener diode,\n(a) symbol, (b) I-V\ncharacteristics.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n486\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n4\n.5\n\nFIGURE 14.22 Zener diode as DC\nvoltage regulator\n\nZener diode as a voltage regulator\n\nWe know that when the ac input voltage of a rectifier fluctuates, its rectified\noutput also fluctuates. To get a constant dc voltage from the dc\nunregulated output of a rectifier, we use a Zener diode. The circuit diagram\nof a voltage regulator using a Zener diode is shown in Fig. 14.22.\n\nThe unregulated dc voltage (filtered output of a\nrectifier) is connected to the Zener diode through a series\nresistance R\n\ns\n such that the Zener diode is reverse biased.\n\nIf the input voltage increases, the current through R\ns\n\nand Zener diode also increases. This increases the\nvoltage drop across R\n\ns\n without any change in the\n\nvoltage across the Zener diode. This is because in the\nbreakdown region, Zener voltage remains constant even\nthough the current through the Zener diode changes.\nSimilarly, if the input voltage decreases, the current\nthrough R\n\ns\n and Zener diode also decreases. The voltage\n\ndrop across R\ns\n decreases without any change in the\n\nvoltage across the Zener diode. Thus any increase/\ndecrease in the input voltage results in, increase/\ndecrease of the voltage drop across R\n\ns\n without any\n\nchange in voltage across the Zener diode. Thus the Zener diode acts as a\nvoltage regulator. We have to select the Zener diode according to the\nrequired output voltage and accordingly the series resistance R\n\ns\n.\n\nExample 14.5 In a Zener regulated power supply a Zener diode with\nV\n\nZ\n = 6.0 V is used for regulation. The load current is to be 4.0 mA and\n\nthe unregulated input is 10.0 V. What should be the value of series\nresistor R\n\nS\n?\n\nSolution\nThe value of R\n\nS\n should be such that the current through the Zener\n\ndiode is much larger than the load current. This is to have good load\nregulation. Choose Zener current as five times the load current, i.e.,\nIZ = 20 mA. The total current through RS is, therefore, 24 mA. The\nvoltage drop across R\n\nS\n  is 10.0 – 6.0 = 4.0 V. This gives\n\nR\nS\n = 4.0V/(24 × 10–3) A = 167 Ω. The nearest value of carbon resistor\n\nis 150 Ω. So, a series resistor of 150 Ω is appropriate. Note that slight\nvariation in the value of the resistor does not matter, what is important\nis that the current IZ should be sufficiently larger than IL.\n\n14.8.2  Optoelectronic junction devices\n\nWe have seen so far, how a semiconductor diode behaves under applied\nelectrical inputs. In this section, we learn about semiconductor diodes in\nwhich carriers are generated by photons (photo-excitation). All these\ndevices are called optoelectronic devices. We shall study the functioning\nof the following optoelectronic devices:\n(i) Photodiodes used for detecting optical signal (photodetectors).\n(ii) Light emitting diodes (LED) which convert electrical energy into light.\n(iii) Photovoltaic devices which convert optical radiation into electricity\n\n(solar cells).\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n487\n\nSemiconductor Electronics:\n\nMaterials, Devices and\n\nSimple Circuits\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n4\n.6\n\n(i) Photodiode\n\nA Photodiode is again a special purpose p-n\njunction diode fabricated with a transparent\nwindow to allow light to fall on the diode. It is\noperated under reverse bias. When the photodiode\nis illuminated with light (photons) with energy (hν)\ngreater than the energy gap (E\n\ng\n) of the\n\nsemiconductor, then electron-hole pairs are\ngenerated due to the absorption of photons. The\ndiode is fabricated such that the generation of\ne-h pairs takes place in or near the depletion region\nof the diode. Due to electric field of the junction,\nelectrons and holes are separated before they\nrecombine. The direction of the electric field is such\nthat electrons reach n-side and holes reach p-side.\nElectrons are collected on n-side and holes are\ncollected on p-side giving rise to an emf. When an\nexternal load is connected, current flows. The\nmagnitude of the photocurrent depends on the\nintensity of incident light (photocurrent is\nproportional to incident light intensity).\n\nIt is easier to observe the change in the current\nwith change in the light intensity, if a reverse bias\nis applied. Thus photodiode can be used as a\nphotodetector to detect optical signals. The circuit\ndiagram used for the measurement of I-V\ncharacteristics of a photodiode is shown in\nFig. 14.23(a) and a typical I-V characteristics in\nFig. 14.23(b).\n\nExample 14.6 The current in the forward bias is known to be more\n(~mA) than the current in the reverse bias (~µA). What is the reason\nthen to operate the photodiodes in reverse bias?\n\nSolution Consider the case of an n-type semiconductor. Obviously,\nthe majority carrier density (n) is considerably larger than the minority\nhole density p (i.e., n >> p). On illumination, let the excess electrons\nand holes generated be ∆n and ∆p, respectively:\n\nn′ = n + ∆n\n\n  p′ = p + ∆p\n\nHere n′ and p′ are the electron and hole concentrations* at any\nparticular illumination and n and p are carriers concentration when\nthere is no illumination. Remember ∆n = ∆p and n >> p. Hence, the\n\nFIGURE 14.23 (a) An illuminated\nphotodiode under reverse bias , (b) I-V\n\ncharacteristics of a photodiode for different\nillumination intensity I4 > I3 > I2 > I1.\n\n* Note that, to create an e-h pair, we spend some energy (photoexcitation, thermal\nexcitation, etc.). Therefore when an electron and hole recombine the energy is\nreleased in the form of light (radiative recombination) or heat (non-radiative\nrecombination). It depends on semiconductor and the method of fabrication of\nthe p-n junction. For the fabrication of LEDs, semiconductors like GaAs, GaAs-\nGaP are used in which radiative recombination dominates.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n488\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n4\n.6\n\nfractional change in the majority carriers (i.e., ∆n/n ) would be much\nless than that in the minority carriers (i.e., ∆p/p). In general, we can\nstate that the fractional change due to the photo-effects on the\nminority carrier dominated reverse bias current is more easily\nmeasurable than the fractional change in the forward bias current.\nHence, photodiodes are preferably used in the reverse bias condition\nfor measuring light intensity.\n\n(ii) Light emitting diode\n\nIt is a heavily doped p-n junction which under forward bias emits\nspontaneous radiation. The diode is encapsulated with a transparent\ncover so that emitted light can come out.\n\nWhen the diode is forward biased, electrons are sent from n → p (where\nthey are minority carriers) and holes are sent from p → n (where they are\nminority carriers). At the junction boundary the concentration of minority\ncarriers increases compared to the equilibrium concentration (i.e., when\nthere is no bias). Thus at the junction boundary on either side of the\njunction, excess minority carriers are there which recombine with majority\ncarriers near the junction. On recombination, the energy is released in\nthe form of  photons. Photons with energy equal to or slightly less than\nthe band gap are emitted. When the forward current of the diode is small,\nthe intensity of light emitted is small. As the forward current increases,\nintensity of light increases and reaches a maximum. Further increase in\nthe forward current results in decrease of light intensity. LEDs are biased\nsuch that the light emitting efficiency is maximum.\n\nThe V-I characteristics of a LED is similar to that of a Si junction\ndiode. But the threshold voltages are much higher and slightly different\nfor each colour. The reverse breakdown voltages of LEDs are very low,\ntypically around 5V. So care should be taken that high reverse voltages\ndo not appear across them.\n\nLEDs that can emit red, yellow, orange, green and blue light are\ncommercially available. The semiconductor used for fabrication of visible\nLEDs must at least have a band gap of 1.8 eV (spectral range of visible\nlight is from about 0.4 µm to 0.7 µm, i.e., from about 3 eV to 1.8 eV). The\ncompound semiconductor Gallium Arsenide – Phosphide (GaAs1–xPx) is\nused for making LEDs of different colours. GaAs0.6 P0.4 (Eg ~ 1.9 eV) is\nused for red LED. GaAs (E\n\ng\n ~ 1.4 eV) is used for making infrared LED.\n\nThese LEDs find extensive use in remote controls, burglar alarm systems,\noptical communication, etc. Extensive research is being done for\ndeveloping white LEDs which can replace incandescent lamps.\n\nLEDs have the following advantages over conventional incandescent\nlow power lamps:\n(i) Low operational voltage and less power.\n(ii) Fast action and no warm-up time required.\n(iii) The bandwidth of emitted light is 100 Å to 500 Å or in other words it\n\nis nearly (but not exactly) monochromatic.\n(iv) Long life and ruggedness.\n(v) Fast on-off switching capability.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n489\n\nSemiconductor Electronics:\n\nMaterials, Devices and\n\nSimple Circuits\n\n(iii) Solar cell\n\nA solar cell is basically a p-n junction which\ngenerates emf when solar radiation falls on the\np-n junction. It works on the same principle\n(photovoltaic effect) as the photodiode, except that\nno external bias is applied and the junction area\nis kept much larger for solar radiation to be\nincident because we are interested in more power.\n\nA simple p-n junction solar cell is shown in\nFig. 14.24.\n\nA p-Si wafer of about 300 µm is taken over\nwhich a thin layer (~0.3 µm) of n-Si is grown on\none-side by diffusion process. The other side of\np-Si is coated with a metal (back contact). On the\ntop of n-Si layer, metal finger electrode (or metallic\ngrid) is deposited. This acts as a front contact. The\nmetallic grid occupies only a very small fraction\nof the cell area (<15%) so that light can be incident\non the cell from the top.\n\nThe generation of emf by a solar cell, when light falls on, it is due to\nthe following three basic processes: generation, separation and collection—\n(i) generation of e-h pairs due to light (with hν > E\n\ng\n)\n\nclose to the junction; (ii) separation of electrons and\nholes due to electric field of the depletion region.\nElectrons are swept to n-side and holes to p-side;\n(iii) the electrons reaching the n-side are collected by\nthe front contact and holes reaching p-side are collected\nby the back contact. Thus p-side becomes positive and\nn-side becomes negative giving rise to photovoltage.\n\nWhen an external load is connected as shown in\nthe Fig. 14.25(a) a photocurrent I\n\nL\n flows through the\n\nload. A typical I-V characteristics of a solar cell is shown\nin the Fig. 14.25(b).\n\nNote that the I – V characteristics of solar cell is\ndrawn in the fourth quadrant of the coordinate axes.\nThis is because a solar cell does not draw current but\nsupplies the same to the load.\n\nSemiconductors with band gap close to 1.5 eV are\nideal materials for solar cell fabrication. Solar cells are\nmade with semiconductors like  Si (E\n\ng\n = 1.1 eV), GaAs\n\n(Eg = 1.43 eV), CdTe (Eg = 1.45 eV), CuInSe2 (Eg = 1.04\neV), etc. The important criteria for the selection of a\nmaterial for solar cell fabrication are (i) band gap (~1.0\nto 1.8 eV), (ii) high optical absorption (~104 cm–1), (iii)\nelectrical conductivity, (iv) availability of the raw\nmaterial, and (v) cost. Note that sunlight is not always\nrequired for a solar cell. Any light with photon energies\ngreater than the bandgap will do. Solar cells are used\nto power electronic devices in satellites and space\nvehicles and also as power supply to some calculators. Production of\nlow-cost photovoltaic cells for large-scale solar energy is a topic\nfor research.\n\nFIGURE 14.24 (a) Typical p-n junction\nsolar cell; (b) Cross-sectional view.\n\nFIGURE 14.25 (a) A typical\nilluminated p-n junction solar cell;\n(b) I-V characteristics of a solar cell.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n490\n\n E\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n4\n.7\n\nExample 14.7 Why are Si and GaAs are preferred materials for\nsolar cells?\n\nSolution  The solar radiation spectrum received by us is shown in\nFig. 14.26.\n\nFIGURE 14.26\n\nThe maxima is near 1.5 eV. For photo-excitation, hν > E\ng\n. Hence,\n\nsemiconductor with band gap ~1.5 eV or lower is likely to give better\nsolar conversion efficiency. Silicon has E\n\ng\n ~ 1.1 eV while for GaAs it is\n\n~1.53 eV. In fact, GaAs is better (in spite of its higher band gap) than\nSi because of its relatively higher absorption coefficient. If we choose\nmaterials like CdS or CdSe (E\n\ng\n ~ 2.4 eV), we can use only the high\n\nenergy component of the solar energy for photo-conversion and a\nsignificant part of energy will be of no use.\nThe question arises: why we do not use material like PbS (E\n\ng\n ~ 0.4 eV)\n\nwhich satisfy the condition hν > E\ng\n for ν maxima corresponding to the\n\nsolar radiation spectra? If we do so, most of the solar radiation will be\nabsorbed on the top-layer of solar cell and will not reach in or near\nthe depletion region. For effective electron-hole separation, due to\nthe junction field, we want the photo-generation to occur in the\njunction region only.\n\n14.9  DIGITAL ELECTRONICS AND LOGIC GATES\nIn electronics circuits like amplifiers, oscillators, introduced to you in\nearlier sections, the signal (current or voltage) has been in the form of\ncontinuous, time-varying voltage or current. Such signals are called\ncontinuous or analog signals. A typical analog signal is shown in Figure.\n14.27(a). Fig. 14.27(b) shows a pulse waveform in which only discrete\nvalues of voltages are possible. It is convenient to use binary numbers\nto represent such signals. A binary number has only two digits ‘0’ (say,\n0V) and ‘1’ (say, 5V). In digital electronics we use only these two levels of\nvoltage as shown in Fig. 14.27(b). Such signals are called Digital Signals.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n491\n\nSemiconductor Electronics:\n\nMaterials, Devices and\n\nSimple Circuits\n\nFIGURE 14.27 (a) Analog signal, (b) Digital signal.\n\nInput Output\n\nA Y\n\n0 1\n\n1 0\n\n(b)\nFIGURE 14.28\n\n(a) Logic symbol,\n(b) Truth table of\n\nNOT gate.\n\nIn digital circuits only two values (represented by 0 or 1) of the input and\noutput voltage are permissible.\n\nThis section is intended to provide the first step in our understanding\nof digital electronics. We shall restrict our study to some basic building\nblocks of digital electronics (called Logic Gates) which process the digital\nsignals in a specific manner. Logic gates are used in calculators, digital\nwatches, computers, robots, industrial control systems, and in\ntelecommunications.\n\nA light switch in your house can be used as an example of a digital\ncircuit. The light is either ON or OFF depending on the switch position.\nWhen the light is ON, the output value is ‘1’. When the light is OFF the\noutput value is ‘0’. The inputs are the position of the light switch. The\nswitch is placed either in the ON or OFF position to activate the light.\n\n14.9.1  Logic gates\n\nA gate is a digital circuit that follows curtain logical relationship\nbetween the input and output voltages. Therefore, they are generally\nknown as logic gates — gates because they control the flow of\ninformation. The five common logic gates used are NOT, AND, OR,\nNAND, NOR. Each logic gate is indicated by a symbol and its function\nis defined by a truth table that shows all the possible input logic level\ncombinations with their respective output logic levels. Truth tables\nhelp understand the behaviour of logic gates. These logic gates can be\nrealised using semiconductor devices.\n\n(i)  NOT gate\n\nThis is the most basic gate, with one input and one output. It produces\na ‘1’ output if the input is ‘0’ and vice-versa. That is, it produces an\ninverted version of the input at its output. This is why it is also known\nas an inverter. The commonly used symbol together with the truth\ntable for this gate is given in Fig. 14.28.\n\n(ii)  OR Gate\n\nAn OR gate has two or more inputs with one output. The logic symbol\nand truth table are shown in Fig. 14.29. The output Y is 1 when either\ninput A or input B or both are 1s, that is, if any of the input is high, the\noutput is high.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n492\n\nE\nX\n\nA\nM\n\nP\nL\nE\n 1\n\n4\n.8\n\nApart from carrying out the above mathematical logic operation, this\ngate can be used for modifying the pulse waveform as explained in the\nfollowing example.\n\nExample 14.8 Justify the output waveform (Y) of the OR gate for the\nfollowing inputs A and B given in Fig. 14.30.\n\nSolution Note the following:\n• At t < t1; A = 0, B = 0; Hence Y = 0\n• For t1 to t2; A = 1, B = 0; Hence Y = 1\n• For t2 to t3; A = 1, B = 1; Hence Y = 1\n• For t3 to t4; A = 0, B = 1; Hence Y = 1\n• For t4 to t5; A = 0, B = 0; Hence Y = 0\n• For t5 to t6; A = 1, B = 0; Hence Y = 1\n• For t > t6; A = 0, B = 1; Hence Y = 1\nTherefore the waveform Y will be as shown in the Fig. 14.30.\n\nFIGURE 14.30\n\n(iii) AND Gate\nAn AND gate has two or more inputs and one output. The output Y of\nAND gate is 1 only when input A and input B are both 1.

If inputs A and B are both\n‘1’, the output Y is not ‘1’. The gate gets its name from this NOT  AND\nbehaviour. Figure 14.33 shows the symbol and truth table of NAND gate.\n\nNAND gates are also called Universal Gates since by using these\ngates you can realise other basic gates like OR, AND and NOT (Exercises\n14.12 and 14.13).\n\nFIGURE 14.33 (a) Logic symbol, (b) Truth table of NAND gate.\n\nExample 14.10 Sketch the output Y from a NAND gate having inputs\nA and B given below:\n\nSolution\n• For t < t1; A = 1, B = 1; Hence Y = 0\n• For t1 to t2; A = 0, B = 0; Hence Y = 1\n• For t2 to t3; A = 0, B = 1; Hence Y = 1\n• For t3 to t4; A = 1, B = 0; Hence Y = 1\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n494\n\nFASTER AND SMALLER: THE FUTURE OF COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY\n\nThe Integrated Chip (IC) is at the heart of all computer systems. In fact ICs are found in\nalmost all electrical devices like cars, televisions, CD players, cell phones etc. The\nminiaturisation that made the modern personal computer possible could never have\nhappened without the IC. ICs are electronic devices that contain many transistors, resistors,\ncapacitors, connecting wires – all in one package.

A NOT- operation applied\nafter OR gate gives a NOT-OR gate (or simply NOR gate). Its output Y is\n‘1’ only when both inputs A and B are ‘0’, i.e., neither one input nor the\nother is ‘1’. The symbol and truth table for NOR gate is given in\nFig. 14.35.\n\nFIGURE 14.35 (a) Logic symbol, (b) Truth table of NOR gate.\n\nNOR gates are considered as universal gates because you can obtain\nall the gates like AND, OR, NOT by using only NOR gates (Exercises 14.14\nand 14.15).\n\nInput Output\n\nA B Y\n\n0 0 1\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\n1 1 0\n\n(b)\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n495\n\nSemiconductor Electronics:\n\nMaterials, Devices and\n\nSimple Circuits\n\nmicroprocessor. The microprocessor is an IC that processes all information in a computer,\nlike keeping track of what keys are pressed, running programmes, games etc. The IC was\nfirst invented by Jack Kilky at Texas Instruments in 1958 and he was awarded Nobel Prize\nfor this in 2000. ICs are produced on a piece of semiconductor crystal (or chip) by a process\ncalled photolithography. Thus, the entire Information Technology (IT) industry hinges on\nsemiconductors. Over the years, the complexity of ICs has increased while the size of its\nfeatures continued to shrink. In the past five decades, a dramatic miniaturisation in\ncomputer technology has made modern day computers faster and smaller. In the 1970s,\nGordon Moore, co-founder of INTEL, pointed out that the memory capacity of a chip (IC)\napproximately doubled every one and a half years. This is popularly known as Moore’s\nlaw. The number of transistors per chip has risen exponentially and each year computers\nare becoming more powerful, yet cheaper than the year before. It is intimated from current\ntrends that the computers available in 2020 will operate at 40 GHz (40,000 MHz) and\nwould be much smaller, more efficient and less expensive than present day computers.\nThe explosive growth in the semiconductor industry and computer technology is best\nexpressed by a famous quote from Gordon Moore: “If the auto industry advanced as rapidly\nas the semiconductor industry, a Rolls Royce would get half a million miles per gallon, and\nit would be cheaper to throw it away than to park it”.\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. Semiconductors are the basic materials used in the present solid state\nelectronic devices like diode, transistor, ICs, etc.\n\n2. Lattice structure and the atomic structure of constituent elements\ndecide whether a particular material will be insulator, metal or\nsemiconductor.\n\n3. Metals have low resistivity (10–2 to 10–8 Ωm), insulators have very high\nresistivity (>108 Ω m–1), while semiconductors have intermediate values\nof resistivity.\n\n4. Semiconductors are elemental (Si, Ge) as well as compound (GaAs,\nCdS, etc.).\n\n5. Pure semiconductors are called ‘intrinsic semiconductors’. The presence\nof charge carriers (electrons and holes) is an ‘intrinsic’ property of the\nmaterial and these are obtained as a result of thermal excitation. The\nnumber of electrons (n\n\ne\n) is equal to the number of holes (n\n\nh \n) in intrinsic\n\nconductors. Holes are essentially electron vacancies with an effective\npositive charge.\n\n6. The number of charge carriers can be changed by  ‘doping’ of a suitable\nimpurity in pure semiconductors. Such semiconductors are known as\nextrinsic semiconductors. These are of two types (n-type and p-type).\n\n7. In n-type semiconductors, n\ne\n >> n\n\nh\n while in p-type semiconductors n\n\nh >> ne.\n8. n-type semiconducting Si or Ge is obtained by doping with pentavalent\n\natoms (donors) like As, Sb, P, etc., while p-type Si or Ge can be obtained\nby doping with trivalent atom (acceptors) like B, Al, In etc.\n\n9. n\ne\nn\n\nh\n = n\n\ni\n\n2 in all cases. Further, the material possesses an overall charge\nneutrality.\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n496\n\n10. There are two distinct band of energies (called valence band and\nconduction band) in which the electrons in a material lie. Valence\nband energies are low as compared to conduction band energies. All\nenergy levels in the valence band are filled while energy levels in the\nconduction band may be fully empty or partially filled. The electrons in\nthe conduction band are free to move in a solid and are responsible for\nthe conductivity. The extent of conductivity depends upon the energy\ngap (E\n\ng\n) between the top of valence band (E\n\nV\n) and the bottom of the\n\nconduction band E\nC\n. The electrons from valence band can be excited by\n\nheat, light or electrical energy to the conduction band and thus, produce\na change in the current flowing in a semiconductor.\n\n11. For insulators Eg > 3 eV, for semiconductors Eg is 0.2 eV to 3 eV, while\nfor metals E\n\ng\n ≈ 0.\n\n12. p-n junction is the ‘key’ to all semiconductor devices. When such a\njunction is made, a ‘depletion layer’ is formed consisting of immobile\nion-cores devoid of their electrons or holes. This is responsible for a\njunction potential barrier.\n\n13. By changing the external applied voltage, junction barriers can be\nchanged. In forward bias (n-side is connected to negative terminal of the\nbattery and p-side is connected to the positive), the barrier is decreased\nwhile the barrier increases in reverse bias. Hence, forward bias current\nis more (mA) while it is very small (µA) in a p-n junction diode.\n\n14. Diodes can be used for rectifying an ac voltage (restricting the ac voltage\nto one direction). With the help of a capacitor or a suitable filter, a dc\nvoltage can be obtained.\n\n15. There are some special purpose diodes.\n16. Zener diode is one such special purpose diode. In reverse bias, after a\n\ncertain voltage, the current suddenly increases (breakdown voltage) in\na Zener diode. This property has been used to obtain voltage regulation.\n\n17. p-n junctions have also been used to obtain many photonic or\noptoelectronic devices where one of the participating entity is ‘photon’:\n(a) Photodiodes in which photon excitation results in a change of reverse\nsaturation current which helps us to measure light intensity; (b) Solar\ncells which convert photon energy into electricity; (c) Light Emitting\nDiode and Diode Laser in which electron excitation by a bias voltage\nresults in the generation of light.\n\n18. There are some special circuits which handle the digital data consisting\nof 0 and 1 levels. This forms the subject of Digital Electronics.\n\n19. The important digital circuits performing special logic operations are\ncalled logic gates. These are: OR, AND, NOT, NAND, and NOR gates.\n\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n\n1. The energy bands (E\nC\n or E\n\nV\n) in the semiconductors are space delocalised\n\nwhich means that these are not located in any specific place inside the\nsolid. The energies are the overall averages. When you see a picture in\nwhich E\n\nC\n or E\n\nV\n are drawn as straight lines, then they should be\n\nrespectively taken simply as the bottom of conduction band energy levels\nand top of valence band energy levels.\n\n2. In elemental semiconductors (Si or Ge), the n-type or p-type\nsemiconductors are obtained by introducing ‘dopants’ as defects. In\ncompound semiconductors, the change in relative stoichiometric ratio\ncan also change the type of semiconductor. For example, in ideal GaAs\n\n2021–22\n\n\n\n497\n\nSemiconductor Electronics:\n\nMaterials, Devices and\n\nSimple Circuits\n\nEXERCISES\n\n14.1 In an n-type silicon, which of the following statement is true:\n(a) Electrons are majority carriers and trivalent atoms are the\n\ndopants.\n\n(b) Electrons are minority carriers and pentavalent atoms are the\ndopants.\n\n(c) Holes are minority carriers and pentavalent atoms are the\ndopants.\n\n(d) Holes are majority carriers and trivalent atoms are the dopants.\n14.2 Which of the statements given in Exercise 14.1 is true for p-type\n\nsemiconductos.\n14.3 Carbon, silicon and germanium have four valence electrons each.\n\nThese are characterised by valence and conduction bands separated\nby energy band gap respectively equal to (E\n\ng\n)\nC\n, (E\n\ng\n)\nSi\n and (E\n\ng\n)\nGe\n\n.
