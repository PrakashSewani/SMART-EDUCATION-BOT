We\n\nfound that the directional aspect of these quantities can be\n\ntaken care of by + and – signs, as in one dimension only two\n\ndirections are possible. But in order to describe motion of an\n\nobject in two dimensions (a plane) or three dimensions\n\n(space), we need to use vectors to describe the above-\n\nmentioned physical quantities.  Therefore, it is first necessary\n\nto learn the language of vectors. What is a vector ? How to\n\nadd, subtract and multiply vectors ? What is the result of\n\nmultiplying a vector by a real number ? We shall learn this\n\nto enable us to use vectors for defining velocity and\n\nacceleration in a plane. We then discuss motion of an object\n\nin a plane.  As a simple case of motion in a plane, we shall\n\ndiscuss motion with constant acceleration and treat in detail\n\nthe projectile motion. Circular motion is a familiar class of\n\nmotion that has a special significance in daily-life situations.\n\nWe shall discuss uniform circular motion in some detail.\n\nThe equations developed in this chapter for motion in a\n\nplane can be easily extended to the case of three dimensions.\n\n4.2  SCALARS AND VECTORS\n\nIn physics, we can classify quantities as scalars or\n\nvectors.  Basically, the difference is that a direction is\nassociated with a vector but not with a scalar.  A scalar\n\nquantity is a quantity with magnitude only. It is specified\n\ncompletely by a single number, along with the proper\n\nunit. Examples are : the distance between two points,\n\nmass of an object, the temperature of a body and the\n\ntime at which a certain event happened.  The rules for\n\ncombining scalars are the rules of ordinary algebra.\n\nScalars can be added, subtracted, multiplied and divided\n\n4.1 Introduction\n\n4.2 Scalars and vectors\n\n4.3 Multiplication of vectors by\nreal numbers\n\n4.4 Addition and subtraction of\nvectors — graphical method\n\n4.5 Resolution of vectors\n\n4.6 Vector addition — analytical\nmethod\n\n4.7 Motion in a plane\n\n4.8 Motion in a plane with\nconstant acceleration\n\n4.9 Relative velocity in two\ndimensions\n\n4.10 Projectile motion\n\n4.11 Uniform circular motion\n\nSummary\n\nPoints to ponder\n\nExercises\n\nAdditional exercises\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS66\n\njust as the ordinary numbers*. For example,\nif the length and breadth of a rectangle are\n1.0 m and 0.5 m respectively, then its\nperimeter is the sum of the lengths of the\nfour sides, 1.0 m + 0.5 m +1.0 m + 0.5 m =\n3.0 m. The length of each side is a scalar\nand the perimeter is also a scalar. Take\nanother example: the maximum and\nminimum temperatures on a particular day\nare 35.6 °C and 24.2 °C respectively.  Then,\nthe difference between the two temperatures\nis 11.4 °C. Similarly, if a uniform solid cube\nof aluminium of side 10 cm has a mass of\n2.7 kg, then its volume is 10–3 m3 (a scalar)\nand its density is 2.7×103 kg m–3 (a scalar).\n\nA vector quantity is a quantity that has both\n\na magnitude and a direction and obeys the\n\ntriangle law of addition or equivalently the\n\nparallelogram law of addition. So, a vector is\n\nspecified by giving its magnitude by a number\n\nand its direction. Some physical quantities that\n\nare represented by vectors are displacement,\n\nvelocity, acceleration and force.\n\nTo represent a vector, we use a bold face type\nin this book. Thus, a velocity vector can be\nrepresented by a symbol v.  Since bold face is\ndifficult to produce, when written by hand, a\nvector is often represented by an arrow placed\n\nover a letter, say \nr\nv . Thus, both v and \n\nr\nv\n\nrepresent the velocity vector. The magnitude of\na vector is often called its absolute value,\nindicated by |v| = v.  Thus, a vector is\nrepresented by a bold face, e.g. by A, a, p, q, r, ...\nx, y, with respective magnitudes denoted by light\nface A, a, p, q, r, ... x, y.\n\n4.2.1  Position and Displacement Vectors\n\nTo describe the position of an object moving in\na plane, we  need to choose a convenient point,\nsay O as origin. Let P and P′ be the positions of\nthe object at time t and t′, respectively [Fig. 4.1(a)].\nWe join O and P by a straight line.  Then, OP is\nthe position vector of the object at time t.  An\narrow is marked at the head of this line.  It is\nrepresented by a symbol r, i.e. OP = r.  Point P′ is\n\nrepresented by another position vector, OP′\ndenoted by r′. The length of the vector r\nrepresents the magnitude of the vector and its\ndirection is the direction in which P lies as seen\nfrom O. If the object moves from P to P′, the\nvector PP′ (with tail at P and tip at P′) is called\nthe displacement vector corresponding to\nmotion from point P (at time t) to point P′ (at time t′).\n\nFig. 4.1 (a) Position and displacement vectors.\n(b) Displacement vector PQ and different\n\n     courses of motion.\n\nIt is important to note that displacement\n\nvector is the straight line joining the initial and\n\nfinal positions and does not depend on the actual\n\npath undertaken by the object between the two\n\npositions.  For example, in Fig. 4.1(b), given the\n\ninitial and final positions as P and Q, the\n\ndisplacement vector is the same PQ for different\n\npaths of journey, say PABCQ, PDQ, and PBEFQ.\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of displacement is\n\neither less or equal to the path length of an\n\nobject between two points. This fact was\nemphasised in the previous chapter also while\n\ndiscussing motion along a straight line.\n\n4.2.2  Equality of Vectors\n\nTwo vectors A and B are said to be equal if, and\n\nonly if, they have the same magnitude and the\n\nsame direction.**\nFigure 4.2(a) shows two equal vectors A and\n\nB. We can easily check their equality.  Shift B\n\nparallel to itself until its tail Q coincides with that\n\nof A, i.e. Q coincides with O. Then, since  their\n\ntips S and P also coincide, the two vectors are\n\nsaid to be equal.  In general, equality is indicated\n\n* Addition and subtraction of scalars make sense only for quantities with same units. However, you can multiply\nand divide scalars of different units.\n\n** In our study, vectors do not have fixed locations. So displacing a vector parallel to itself leaves the vector\nunchanged. Such vectors are called free vectors. However, in some physical applications, location or line of\napplication of a vector is important. Such vectors are called localised vectors.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMOTION IN A PLANE 67\n\nas A = B. Note that in Fig. 4.2(b), vectors A′  and\nB′  have the same magnitude but they are not\nequal because they have different directions.\nEven if we shift B′  parallel to itself so that its tail\nQ′  coincides with the tail O′  of A′ , the tip S′  of B′\ndoes not coincide with the tip P′  of A′ .\n\n4.3 MULTIPLICATION OF VECTORS BY REAL\nNUMBERS\n\nMultiplying a vector A with a positive number λ\ngives a vector whose magnitude is changed by\nthe factor λ but the direction is the same as that\nof A :\n\n\uf8e6 λ A\uf8e6  = λ \uf8e6 A\uf8e6  if λ > 0.\nFor example, if A is multiplied by 2, the resultant\nvector 2A is in the same direction as A and has\n\na magnitude twice of |A| as shown in Fig. 4.3(a).\n\nMultiplying a vector A by a negative number\n−λ gives another vector whose direction is\nopposite to the direction of A and whose\nmagnitude is λ times |A|.\n\nMultiplying a given vector A by negative\nnumbers, say –1 and –1.5, gives vectors as\nshown in Fig 4.3(b).\n\nThe  factor λ by  which  a vector A is multiplied\ncould be a scalar having its own physical\ndimension. Then, the dimension of λ A is the\nproduct of the dimensions of λ and A. For\nexample, if we multiply a constant velocity vector\nby duration (of time), we get a displacement\nvector.\n\n4.4 ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION OF\nVECTORS — GRAPHICAL METHOD\n\nAs mentioned in section 4.2, vectors, by\ndefinition, obey the triangle law or equivalently,\nthe parallelogram law of addition.  We shall now\ndescribe this law of addition using the graphical\nmethod. Let us consider two vectors A and B that\nlie in a plane as shown in Fig. 4.4(a).  The lengths\nof the line segments representing these vectors\nare proportional to the magnitude of the vectors.\nTo find the sum A + B, we place vector B so that\nits tail is at the head of the vector A, as in\nFig. 4.4(b). Then, we join the tail of A to the head\nof B. This line OQ represents a vector R, that is,\nthe sum of the vectors A and B. Since, in this\nprocedure of vector addition, vectors are\n\nFig. 4.2  (a) Two equal vectors A and B.  (b) Two\n\nvectors A′      and B′  are unequal though they\nare of the same length.\n\nFig. 4.3 (a) Vector A and the resultant vector after\nmultiplying A by a positive number 2.\n(b) Vector A and resultant vectors after\nmultiplying it by a negative number –1\nand –1.5.\n\n(c) (d)\n\nFig. 4.4  (a) Vectors A and B. (b) Vectors A and B\nadded graphically. (c) Vectors B and A\nadded graphically. (d) Illustrating the\nassociative law of vector addition.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS68\n\narranged head to tail, this graphical method is\ncalled the head-to-tail method. The two vectors\nand their resultant form three sides of a triangle,\nso this method is also known as triangle method\nof vector addition. If we find the resultant of\nB + A as in Fig. 4.4(c), the same vector R is\nobtained. Thus, vector addition is commutative:\n\nA + B = B + A (4.1)\n\nThe addition of vectors also obeys the associative\nlaw as illustrated in Fig. 4.4(d). The result of\nadding vectors A and B first and then adding\nvector C is the same as the result of adding B\nand C first and then adding vector A :\n\n(A + B) + C = A + (B + C) (4.2)\n\nWhat is the result of adding two equal and\nopposite vectors ? Consider  two  vectors A and\n–A shown in Fig. 4.3(b). Their sum is A + (–A).\nSince the magnitudes of the two vectors are the\nsame, but the directions are opposite, the\nresultant vector has zero magnitude and is\nrepresented by 0 called a null vector or a zero\nvector :\n\nA – A = 0         |0|= 0 (4.3)\n\nSince the magnitude of a null vector is zero, its\ndirection cannot be specified.\n\nThe null vector also results when we multiply\na vector A by the number zero. The main\nproperties of 0 are :\n\nA + 0 = A\nλ 0 = 0\n0 A = 0        (4.4)\n\nFig. 4.5 (a) Two vectors A and B, – B is also shown. (b) Subtracting vector B from vector A – the result is R\n2\n. For\n\ncomparison, addition of vectors A and B, i.e. R\n1\n is also shown.\n\nWhat is the physical meaning of a zero vector?\nConsider the position and displacement vectors\nin a plane as shown in Fig. 4.1(a). Now suppose\nthat an object which is at P at time t, moves to\nP′ and then comes back to P. Then, what is its\ndisplacement? Since the initial and final\npositions coincide, the displacement is a “null\nvector”.\n\nSubtraction of vectors can be defined in terms\nof addition of vectors. We define the difference\nof two vectors A and B as the sum of two vectors\nA and –B :\n\nA – B = A + (–B) (4.5)\n\nIt is shown in Fig 4.5. The vector –B is added to\nvector A to get R\n\n2 \n= (A – B). The vector R\n\n1 \n= A + B\n\nis also shown in the same figure for comparison.\n\nWe can also use the parallelogram method to\nfind the sum of two vectors. Suppose we have\n\ntwo vectors A and B. To add these vectors, we\nbring their tails to a common origin O as\n\nshown in Fig. 4.6(a). Then we draw a line from\nthe head of A parallel to B and another line from\nthe head of B parallel to A to complete a\nparallelogram OQSP.  Now we join the point of\n\nthe intersection of these two lines to the origin\n\nO. The resultant vector R is directed from the\ncommon origin O along  the diagonal (OS) of the\nparallelogram [Fig. 4.6(b)]. In Fig.4.6(c), the\n\ntriangle law is used to obtain the resultant of A\nand B and we see that the two methods yield the\nsame result. Thus, the two methods are\n\nequivalent.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMOTION IN A PLANE 69\n\n\uf074\n\nExample 4.1 Rain is falling vertically with\na speed of 35 m s–1.  Winds starts blowing\nafter sometime with a speed of 12 m s–1 in\neast to west direction.  In which direction\nshould a boy waiting at a bus stop hold\nhis umbrella ?\n\nFig. 4.7\n\nAnswer  The velocity of the rain and the wind\nare represented by the vectors v\n\nr\n and v\n\nw\n in      Fig.\n\n4.7 and are in the direction specified by the\nproblem.  Using the rule of vector addition, we\nsee that the resultant of v\n\nr\n and v\n\nw\n is R as shown\n\nin the figure.  The magnitude of R is\n\nR v v\nr\n\n2\n\nw\n\n2\n= + = + =\n\n− −\n35 12  m s 37 m s\n\n2 2 1 1\n\nThe direction θ  that R makes with the vertical\nis given by\n\n12\ntan 0.343\n\n35\nw\n\nr\n\nv\n \n\nv\nθ = = =\n\nOr,     ( ) θ = = °tan- .1 0 343 19\nTherefore, the boy should hold his umbrella\n\nin the vertical plane at an angle of about 19o\n\nwith the vertical towards the east.\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf074\n\nFig. 4.6 (a) Two vectors A and B with their tails brought to a common origin. (b) The sum A + B obtained using\nthe parallelogram method. (c) The parallelogram method of vector addition is equivalent to the triangle\nmethod.\n\n4.5  RESOLUTION OF VECTORS\n\nLet a and b be any two non-zero vectors in a\nplane with different directions and let A be\nanother vector in the same plane(Fig. 4.8). A can\nbe expressed as a sum of two vectors — one\nobtained by multiplying a by a real number and\nthe other obtained by multiplying b by another\nreal number. To see this, let O and P be the tail\nand head of the vector A. Then, through O, draw\na straight line parallel to a, and through P, a\nstraight line parallel to b. Let them intersect at\nQ. Then, we have\n\nA = OP  = OQ + QP (4.6)\n\nBut since OQ is parallel to a, and QP is parallel\nto b, we can write :\n\nOQ = λ a, and QP = µ b (4.7)\nwhere  λ and µ are real numbers.\n\nTherefore, A = λ a + µ b (4.8)\n\nFig. 4.8 (a) Two non-colinear vectors a and b.\n(b) Resolving a vector A in terms of vectors\n\na and b.\n\nWe say that A has been resolved into two\ncomponent vectors λ a and µ b along a and b\nrespectively. Using this method one can resolve\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS70\n\nFig. 4.9 (a) Unit vectors  \uf001i  , \uf001j  and \uf001k lie along the x-, y-, and z-axes. (b) A vector A is resolved into its\ncomponents A\n\nx \nand A\n\ny\n along x-, and y- axes. (c) A\n\n1\n and  A\n\n2 \nexpressed in terms of \uf001i  and \uf001j .\n\na given vector into two component vectors along\na set of two vectors – all the three lie in the same\nplane. It is convenient to resolve a general vector\nalong the axes of a rectangular coordinate\nsystem using vectors of unit magnitude. These\nare called unit vectors that we discuss now. A\nunit vector is a vector of unit magnitude and\npoints in a particular direction. It has no\ndimension and unit. It is used to specify a\ndirection only. Unit vectors along the x-, y- and\nz-axes of a rectangular coordinate system are\n\ndenoted by \uf001i , \uf001j  and k̂ , respectively, as shown\nin Fig. 4.9(a).\nSince these are unit vectors, we have\n\n\uf8e6 î  \uf8e6 = \uf8e6 ĵ \uf8e6 = \uf8e6 k̂ \uf8e6=1 (4.9)\nThese unit vectors are perpendicular to each\n\nother. In this text, they are printed in bold face\nwith a cap (^) to distinguish them from other\nvectors. Since we are dealing with motion in two\ndimensions in this chapter, we require use of\nonly two unit vectors. If we multiply a unit vector,\n\nsay n̂ by a scalar, the result is a vector\n\nλλλλλ = λn̂.  In general, a vector A can be written as\n\nA = |A| n̂ (4.10)\n\nwhere n̂ is a unit vector along A.\n\nWe can now resolve a vector A in terms\nof component vectors that lie along unit vectors\n\nî  and \uf001j.  Consider a vector A that lies in x-y\nplane as shown in Fig. 4.9(b). We draw lines from\nthe head of A perpendicular to the coordinate\naxes as in Fig. 4.9(b), and get vectors A\n\n1\n and A\n\n2\n\nsuch that  A\n1\n + A\n\n2 \n= A. Since A\n\n1\n is parallel to  \uf001i\n\nand A\n2\n is parallel to \n\n\uf001j ,  we have :\n\nA\n1\n= A\n\nx\n \uf001i ,  A2 = Ay \n\n\uf001j (4.11)\n\nwhere A\nx \n and  A\n\ny\n are real numbers.\n\nThus,    A = A\nx  \n\n\uf001i+ Ay \n\uf001j              (4.12)\n\nThis is represented in Fig. 4.9(c). The quantities\nA\n\nx  \nand A\n\ny  \nare called x-, and y- components of the\n\nvector A. Note that A\nx\n is itself not a vector, but\n\nA\nx\n \n\uf001i  is a vector, and so is A\n\ny \n\n\uf001j . Using simple\ntrigonometry, we can express A\n\nx   \nand A\n\ny\n in terms\n\nof the magnitude of A and the angle θ it makes\nwith the x-axis :\n\nA\nx \n = A cos θ\n\nA\ny\n = A sin θ (4.13)\n\nAs is clear from Eq. (4.13), a component of a\nvector can be positive, negative or zero\ndepending on the value of θ.\n\nNow, we have two ways to specify a vector A\nin a plane. It can be specified by :\n(i) its magnitude A and the direction θ it makes\n\nwith the x-axis; or\n(ii) its components A\n\nx\n and A\n\ny\n\nIf A and θ  are given,  A\nx \nand A\n\ny  \ncan be obtained\n\nusing Eq. (4.13). If A\nx  \nand A\n\ny  \n are given, A and θ\n\ncan be obtained as follows :\n\nA A A A\nx\n\n2\n\ny\n\n2 2 2 2 2\n+ = +cos sinθ θ\n\n = A2\n\nOr, A A Ax\n2\n\ny\n2= +      (4.14)\n\nAnd tan , tanθ θ= =\n−\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\ny\n\nx\n\ny\n\nx\n\n1\n\n             (4.15)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMOTION IN A PLANE 71\n\n\uf074\n\nB i j= +B Bx y\n\uf001 \uf001\n\nLet R be their sum. We have\n\nR = A + B\n\n   ( ) ( )= + + +A A B Bx y x y\uf001 \uf001 \uf001 \uf001i j i j (4.19a)\nSince vectors obey the commutative and\n\nassociative laws, we can arrange and regroup\nthe vectors in Eq. (4.19a) as convenient to us :\n\n( ) ( )R i j= + + +A B A Bx x y y\uf001 \uf001 (4.19b)\nSinceR i j= +R Rx y\n\n\uf001 \uf001 (4.20)\n\nwe have, x x x y y yR A B ,  R A B  = + = + (4.21)\nThus, each component of the resultant\n\nvector R is the sum of the corresponding\ncomponents of A and B.\n\nIn three dimensions, we have\n\nA i j k= + +A A Ax y z\n\uf001 \uf001 \uf001\n\nB i j k= + +B B Bx y z\n\uf001 \uf001 \uf001\n\nR A B i j k= + = + +R R Rx y z\n\uf001 \uf001 \uf001\n\nwith R A Bx x x= +\n\nR A By y y= +\n\nR A Bz z z= + (4.22)\n\nThis method can be extended to addition and\nsubtraction of any number of vectors. For\nexample, if vectors a, b and c are given as\n\na i j k= + +a a ax y z\n\uf001 \uf001 \uf001\n\nb i j k= + +b b bx y z\n\uf001 \uf001 \uf001\n\nc i j k= + +c c cx y z\n\uf001 \uf001 \uf001 (4.23a)\n\nthen, a vector T = a + b – c has components :\n\nT a b c\nx x x x\n\n= + −\n\nT a b cy y y y= + − (4.23b)\n\nT a b cz z z z= + − .\n\nExample 4.2 Find the magnitude and\ndirection of the resultant of two vectors A\nand B in terms of their magnitudes and\nangle θ between them.\n\nFig. 4.9 (d) A vector A resolved into components along\n\nx-, y-, and z-axes\n\n* Note that angles α, β, and γ are angles in space.

(b) Displacement ∆r and\naverage velocity v of a particle.\n\nSuppose a particle moves along the curve shown\nby the thick line and is at P at time t and P′  at\ntime t′  [Fig. 4.12(b)].  Then, the displacement is :\n\n∆r  = r′  – r (4.25)\nand is directed from P to P′ .\n\nWe can write Eq.

In\nthese figures, the thick line represents the path\nof an object, which is at P at time t.   P\n\n1\n, P\n\n2\n and\n\nP\n3 \nrepresent the positions of the object  after\n\ntimes ∆t\n1\n,∆t\n\n2\n, and ∆t\n\n3\n. ∆r\n\n1\n,  ∆r\n\n2\n, and ∆r\n\n3\n are the\n\ndisplacements of the object in times  ∆t\n1\n, ∆t\n\n2\n, and\n\nFig. 4.13 As the time interval ∆t approaches zero, the average velocity approaches the velocity v. The direction\nof  v is parallel to the line tangent to the path.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS74\n\n∆t\n3\n, respectively. The direction of the average\n\nvelocity v   is shown in figures (a), (b) and (c) for\nthree decreasing values of ∆t, i.e. ∆t\n\n1\n,∆t\n\n2\n, and ∆t\n\n3\n,\n\n(∆t\n1 \n\n>  ∆t\n2 \n\n>  ∆t\n3\n). As ∆t →→→→→ 0, ∆r →→→→→ 0\n\nand is along the tangent to the path [Fig. 4.13(d)].\nTherefore, the direction of velocity at any point\non the path of an object is tangential to the\npath at that point and is in the direction of\nmotion.\n\nWe can express v in a component form :\n\nv\nr\n\n=\nd\n\ndt\n\n = +\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f7\n\n→\nlim\n\nx\n\nt\n\ny\n\ntt∆\n\n∆\n\n∆\n\n∆\n\n∆0\n\uf001 \uf001i j                   (4.29)\n\n= +\n→ →\n\n\uf001 \uf001i jlim\nx\n\nt\nlim\n\ny\n\ntt t∆ ∆\n\n∆\n\n∆\n\n∆\n\n∆0 0\n\nOr, v i j i j= + = +\uf001 \uf001 \uf001 \uf001\nd\n\nd\n\nd\n\nd\n\nx\n\nt\n\ny\n\nt\nv vx y .\n\nwhere v\nx\n\nt\nv\n\ny\n\nt\nx y= =\n\nd\n\nd\n\nd\n\nd\n,                 (4.30a)\n\nSo, if the expressions for the coordinates x and\ny are known as functions of time, we can use\nthese equations to find v\n\nx\n and v\n\ny\n.\n\nThe magnitude of v is then\n\nv v vx\n2\n\ny\n2= + (4.30b)\n\nand the direction of v is given by the angle θ :\n\ntan   tan\n1\n\nθ θ= =\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\n−v\n\nv\n\nv\n\nv\n\ny\n\nx\n\ny\n\nx\n\n\uf001               (4.30c)\n\nv\nx\n, v\n\ny\n and angle θ are shown in Fig. 4.14 for a\n\nvelocity vector v at point p.\n\nAcceleration\n\nThe average acceleration  a of an object for a\ntime interval ∆t moving in x-y plane is the change\nin velocity divided by the time interval :\n\n  \n( )\n\na\nv i j\n\ni j= =\n+\n\n= +\n∆\n\n∆\n\n∆\n\n∆\n\n∆\n\n∆\n\n∆\n\n∆t\n\nv v\n\nt\n\nv\n\nt\n\nv\n\nt\n\nx y x y\n\uf001 \uf001\n\n\uf001 \uf001         (4.31a)\n\nOr, a i j= +a ax y\n\uf001 \uf001 .

This is shown in Figs. 4.15(a) to\n(d).  P represents the position of the object at\ntime t and P\n\n1\n, P\n\n2\n, P\n\n3\n positions after time ∆t\n\n1\n, ∆t\n\n2\n,\n\n∆t\n3\n, respectively (∆t\n\n 1\n> ∆t\n\n2\n>∆t\n\n3\n). The velocity vectors\n\nat points P, P\n1\n, P\n\n2\n, P\n\n3\n are also shown in Figs. 4.15\n\n(a), (b) and (c). In each case of ∆t, ∆v is obtained\nusing the triangle law of vector addition. By\ndefinition, the direction of average   acceleration\nis the same as that of ∆v. We see that as ∆t\ndecreases, the direction of ∆v changes and\nconsequently, the direction of the acceleration\nchanges. Finally, in the limit ∆t \uf0670 [Fig. 4.15(d)],\nthe average acceleration becomes the\ninstantaneous acceleration and has the direction\nas shown.\n\nFig. 4.14 The components v\nx\n and vy\n\n \nof velocity v and\n\nthe angle θ it makes with x-axis.

Over an\ninterval of time, the average acceleration will\nequal this constant value.

We follow the method used in the one-\ndimensional case. Let r\n\no\n and r be the position\n\nvectors of the particle at time 0 and t and let the\nvelocities at these instants be v\n\no\n and v. Then,\n\nover this time interval t, the average velocity is\n(v\n\no\n + v)/2.

That is, motion in\na plane (two-dimensions) can be treated as two\nseparate simultaneous one-dimensional\nmotions with constant acceleration along two\nperpendicular directions.  This is an important\nresult and is useful in analysing motion of objects\nin two dimensions. A similar result holds for three\ndimensions. The choice of perpendicular\ndirections is convenient in many physical\nsituations, as we shall see in section 4.10 for\nprojectile motion.\n\nExample 4.5 A particle starts from origin\nat t = 0 with a velocity 5.0 î m/s and moves\nin x-y plane under action of a force which\nproduces a constant acceleration of\n\n(3.0i\uf024\uf024\uf024\uf024\uf024+2.0j\uf024\uf024\uf024\uf024\uf024 ) m/s2.

Suppose that two objects\nA and B are moving with velocities v\n\nA\n and v\n\nB\n\n(each with respect to some common frame of\nreference, say ground.). Then, velocity of object\nA relative to that of B is :\n\nv\nAB \n\n= v\nA \n– v\n\nB\n(4.35a)\n\nand similarly, the velocity of object B relative to\nthat of A is :\n\nv\nBA  \n\n=  v\nB \n\n–\n  \nv\n\nA\n\nTherefore, v\nAB   \n\n= – v\nBA\n\n        (4.35b)\n\nand, v vAB BA= (4.35c)\n\nExample 4.6   Rain is falling vertically with\na speed of 35 m s–1. A woman rides a bicycle\nwith a speed of 12 m s–1  in east to west\ndirection.

Both these velocities are with\nrespect to the ground. Since the woman is riding\na bicycle, the velocity of rain as  experienced by\n\nFig. 4.16\n\nher is the velocity of rain relative to the velocity\nof the bicycle she is riding. That is  v\n\nrb \n= v\n\nr \n–\n\n  \nv\n\nb\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMOTION IN A PLANE 77\n\nThis relative velocity vector as shown in\nFig. 4.16 makes an angle θ  with the vertical.

In Example 4.1,\n\nthe boy experiences the resultant (vector\n\nsum) of two velocities while in this example,\n\nthe woman experiences the velocity of rain\n\nrelative to the bicycle (the vector difference\n\nof the two velocities). \uf074\n\n4.10  PROJECTILE MOTION\n\nAs an application of the ideas developed in the\n\nprevious sections, we consider the motion of a\n\nprojectile. An object that is in flight after being\n\nthrown or projected is called a projectile.  Such\n\na projectile might be a football, a cricket ball, a\n\nbaseball or any other object. The motion of a\n\nprojectile may be thought of as the result of two\n\nseparate, simultaneously occurring components\n\nof motions. One component is along a horizontal\n\ndirection without  any acceleration and the other\n\nalong the vertical direction with constant\n\nacceleration due to the force of gravity. It was\n\nGalileo who first stated this independency of the\n\nhorizontal and the vertical components of\n\nprojectile motion in his Dialogue on the great\n\nworld systems (1632).\n\nIn our discussion, we shall assume that the\n\nair resistance has negligible effect on the motion\n\nof the projectile. Suppose that the projectile is\n\nlaunched with velocity v\no\n that makes an angle\n\nθ\no\n with  the x-axis as shown in Fig. 4.17.\n\nAfter the object has been projected, the\n\nacceleration acting on it is that due to gravity\n\nwhich is directed vertically downward:\n\na j= −g \uf002\n\nOr, a\nx\n = 0, a\n\ny\n = – g (4.36)\n\nThe components of initial velocity v\no\n are :\n\nv\nox \n\n= v\no\n cos θo\n\nv\noy\n\n= v\no\n sin θo       (4.37)\n\nIf we take the initial position to be the origin of\nthe reference frame as shown in Fig. 4.17, we\nhave :\n\nx\no \n= 0, y\n\no\n = 0\n\nThen, Eq.(4.34b) becomes :\n\nx = v\nox \n\nt = (v\no\n cos θ\n\no \n) t\n\nand y = (v\no\n sin θ\n\no\n ) t – ( ½ )g t2       (4.38)\n\nThe components of velocity at time t can be\nobtained using Eq.(4.33b) :\n\nv\nx\n = v\n\nox\n = v\n\no\n cos θ\n\no\n\nv\ny = vo sin θo – g t (4.39)\n\nEquation (4.38) gives the x-, and y-coordinates\n\nof the position of a projectile at time t in terms of\n\ntwo parameters — initial speed v\no\n and projection\n\nangle θ\no\n. Notice that the choice of mutually\n\nperpendicular x-, and y-directions for the\n\nanalysis of the projectile motion has resulted in\n\na simplification. One of the components of\n\nvelocity, i.e. x-component remains constant\n\nthroughout the motion and only the\n\ny- component changes, like an object in free fall\n\nin vertical direction.  This is shown graphically\n\nat few instants in Fig. 4.18.

The word “uniform”\nrefers to the speed, which is uniform (constant)\nthroughout the motion.  Suppose an object is\nmoving with uniform speed v in a circle of radius\nR as shown in Fig. 4.19. Since the velocity of the\nobject is changing continuously in direction, the\nobject undergoes acceleration. Let us find the\nmagnitude and the direction of this acceleration.\n\nNeglecting air resistance - what does\nthe assumption really mean?\n\nWhile treating the topic of projectile motion,\nwe have stated that we assume that the\nair resistance has no effect on the motion\nof the projectile. You must understand what\nthe statement really means. Friction, force\ndue to viscosity, air resistance are all\ndissipative forces. In the presence of any of\nsuch forces opposing motion, any object will\nlose some part of its initial energy and\nconsequently, momentum too. Thus, a\nprojectile that traverses a parabolic path\nwould certainly show deviation from its\nidealised trajectory in the presence of air\nresistance. It will not hit the ground with\nthe same speed with which it was projected\nfrom it. In the absence of air resistance, the\nx-component of the velocity remains\nconstant and it is only the y-component that\nundergoes a continuous change. However,\nin the presence of air resistance, both of\nthese would get affected. That would mean\nthat the range would be less than the one\ngiven by Eq. (4.43). Maximum height\nattained would also be less than that\npredicted by Eq. (4.42). Can you then,\nanticipate the change in the time of flight?\n\nIn order to avoid air resistance, we will\nhave to perform the experiment in vacuum\nor under low pressure, which is not easy.\nWhen we use a phrase like ‘neglect air\nresistance’, we imply that the change in\nparameters such as range, height etc. is\nmuch smaller than their values without air\nresistance. The calculation without air\nresistance is much simpler than that with\nair resistance.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS80\n\nLet r and r′ be the position vectors and v and\nv′ the velocities of the object when it is at point P\nand P ′ as shown in Fig. 4.19(a).  By definition,\nvelocity at a point is along the tangent at that\npoint in the direction of motion. The velocity\nvectors v and v′ are as shown in Fig. 4.19(a1).\n∆v is obtained in Fig. 4.19 (a2) using the triangle\nlaw of vector addition. Since the path is circular,\nv is perpendicular to r and so is v′ to r′.\nTherefore, ∆v is perpendicular to ∆r. Since\n\naverage acceleration is along ∆v a\nv\n\n=\n\uf001\n\n\uf002\n\uf003\n\n\uf004\n\n\uf005\n\uf006\n\n∆\n\n∆t\n, the\n\naverage acceleration a  is perpendicular to ∆r. If\nwe place ∆v on the line that bisects the angle\nbetween r and r′, we see that it is directed towards\nthe centre of the circle. Figure 4.19(b) shows the\nsame quantities for smaller time interval. ∆v and\nhence a  is again directed towards the centre.\n\nIn Fig. 4.19(c), ∆t\uf08e 0 and the average\nacceleration becomes the instantaneous\nacceleration. It is directed towards the centre*.\nThus, we find that the acceleration of an object\nin uniform circular motion is always directed\ntowards the centre of the circle. Let us now find\nthe magnitude of the acceleration.\n\nThe magnitude of a is, by definition, given by\n\na\nv\n\n=\n→∆\n\n∆\n∆t 0 t\n\nLet the angle between position vectors r and\n\nr′ be ∆θ.   Since the velocity vectors v and v′ are\nalways perpendicular to the position vectors, the\n\nangle between them is also ∆θ . Therefore, the\ntriangle CPP ′ formed by the position vectors and\nthe triangle GHI formed by the velocity vectors\nv, v′ and ∆v are similar (Fig. 4.19a).  Therefore,\nthe ratio of the base-length to side-length for\none of the triangles is equal to that of the other\ntriangle. That is :\n\n∆ ∆v r\n\nv R\n=\n\nOr, ∆\n∆\n\nv\nr\n\n= v\nR\n\nTherefore,\n\n  a\nv r r\n\n=\n→\n\n=\n→\n\n=\n→∆\n\n∆\n\n∆ ∆\n\n∆\n\n∆ ∆\n\n∆\n\n∆t 0 0 R R 0t t\n\nv\n\nt\n\nv\n\nt t\n\nIf ∆t is small, ∆θ will also be small and then arc\nPP′ can be approximately taken to be|∆r|:\n\n∆ ∆r ≅ v t\n\n           \n∆\n∆\nr\n\nt\nv≅\n\nOr,\n∆\n\n∆\n\n∆t 0 t\nv\n\n→\n=\n\nr\n\nTherefore, the centripetal acceleration a\nc\n is :\n\nFig. 4.19 Velocity and acceleration of an object in uniform circular motion.  The time interval ∆t decreases from\n(a) to (c) where it is zero.  The acceleration is directed, at each point of the path, towards the centre of\n\nthe circle.\n\n * In the limit ∆t\uf08e0, ∆r becomes perpendicular to r. In this limit ∆v→ 0 and is consequently also perpendicular\n    to  V. Therefore, the acceleration is directed towards the centre, at each point of the circular path.\n\nlim\n\nlimlim lim\n\nlim\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMOTION IN A PLANE 81\n\n\uf074\n\na\nc\n  =   \n\nv\n\nR\n\n\uf001 \uf004\n\uf003 \uf006\n\uf002 \uf005\n\nv = v2/R (4.44)\n\nThus, the acceleration of an object moving with\n\nspeed v in a circle of radius R has a magnitude\n\nv\n2\n/R and is always directed towards the centre.\n\nThis is why this acceleration is called centripetal\nacceleration (a term proposed by Newton). A\nthorough analysis of centripetal acceleration was\nfirst published in 1673 by the Dutch scientist\nChristiaan Huygens (1629-1695) but it was\nprobably known to Newton also some years earlier.\n“Centripetal” comes from a Greek term which means\n‘centre-seeking’.  Since v and R are constant, the\nmagnitude of the centripetal acceleration is also\nconstant. However, the direction changes —\npointing always towards the centre.  Therefore, a\ncentripetal acceleration is not a constant vector.\n\nWe have another way of describing the\nvelocity and the acceleration of an object  in\nuniform circular motion.  As the object moves\nfrom P to P′ in time ∆t (= t′ – t), the line CP\n(Fig. 4.19) turns through an angle ∆θ  as shown\nin the figure. ∆θ  is called angular distance.  We\ndefine the angular speed ω (Greek letter omega)\nas the time rate of change of angular\ndisplacement :\n\nω\nθ\n\n=\n∆\n\n∆t      (4.45)\n\nNow, if the distance travelled by the object\nduring the time ∆t is ∆s, i.e. PP′ is ∆s, then :\n\nv\ns\n\nt\n=\n\n∆\n∆\n\nbut ∆s = R ∆θ. Therefore :\n\nv R\nt\n\n= =\n∆\n\n∆\n\nθ\nωR \n\nv =  R ω (4.46)\n\nWe can express centripetal acceleration a\nc\n in\n\nterms of angular speed :\n\na\nv\n\nR\n\nR\n\nR\nRc = = =\n\n2 2\n2ω\n\nω\n2\n\na Rc = ω\n2 (4.47)\n\nThe time taken by an object to make one revolution\nis known as its time period T and the number of\nrevolution made in one second is called its\nfrequency ν (=1/T ).  However, during this time the\ndistance moved by the object is s = 2πR.\nTherefore, v = 2πR/T =2πRν (4.48)\nIn terms of frequency ν, we have\n\nω = 2πν\n           v = 2πRν\n\na\nc\n = 4π2 ν2R                                       (4.49)\n\nExample 4.10 An insect trapped in a\ncircular groove of radius 12 cm moves along\nthe groove steadily and completes 7\nrevolutions in 100 s.

The acceleration is\ndirected towards the centre of the circle. Since\nthis direction changes continuously,\nacceleration here is not a constant vector.\nHowever, the magnitude of acceleration is\nconstant:\n\na = ω2 R = (0.44 s–1)2 (12 cm)\n\n         = 2.3 cm s-2 \uf074\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS82\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. Scalar quantities are quantities with magnitudes only.  Examples are distance, speed,\nmass and  temperature.\n\n2. Vector quantities are quantities with magnitude and direction both.  Examples are\ndisplacement, velocity and  acceleration. They obey special rules of vector algebra.\n\n3. A vector A multiplied by a real number λ  is also a vector, whose magnitude is λ times\nthe magnitude of the vector A and whose direction is the same or opposite depending\n\nupon whether λ is positive or negative.\n4. Two vectors A and B may be added graphically using head-to-tail method or parallelogram\n\nmethod.\n5. Vector addition is commutative :\n\nA + B = B + A\nIt also obeys the associative law :\n\n(A + B) + C = A + (B + C)\n6. A null or zero vector is a vector with zero magnitude.  Since the magnitude is zero, we\n\ndon’t have to specify its direction.  It has the properties :\nA + 0 = A\n\n     λ0 = 0\n   0 A = 0\n\n7. The subtraction of vector B from A is defined as the sum of A and –B :\nA – B = A+ (–B)\n\n8. A vector A can be resolved into component along two given vectors a and b lying in the\nsame plane :\n\nA = λ a + µ b\nwhere λ and µ  are real numbers.\n\n9. A unit vector associated with a vector A has magnitude 1 and is along the vector A:\n\nn̂\nA\n\nA\n=\n\nThe unit vectors  \uf001 \uf001 \uf001i,  j,  k  are vectors of unit magnitude and point in the direction of\nthe x-, y-, and z-axes, respectively in a right-handed coordinate system.\n\n10. A vector A can be expressed as\n\nA i + j= A Ax y\n\uf001 \uf001\n\nwhere A\nx\n, A\n\ny\n are its components along x-, and y -axes.  If vector A makes an angle θ\n\nwith the x-axis, then A\nx\n = A cos θ, A\n\ny\n=A sin θ and  \n\n2 2 ,  tan = .\ny\n\nx y\n\nx\n\nA\nA A A\n\nA\nθ= = +A\n\n11.

An object that is in flight after being projected is called a projectile.  If an object is\nprojected with initial velocity v\n\no\n making an angle θ\n\no\n with x-axis and if we assume its\n\ninitial position to coincide with the origin of the coordinate system, then the position\nand velocity of the projectile at time t are given by :\n\nx = (v\no\n cos θ\n\no\n) t\n\n                  y = (v\no \nsin θ\n\no\n) t − (1/2) g t2\n\nv\nx\n = v\n\nox\n = v\n\no\n cos θ\n\no\n\nv\ny\n = v\n\no\n sin θ\n\no\n − g t\n\n       The path of a projectile is parabolic and is given by :\n\n( )\n( )\n\n2\n\n0 2\ntan\n\ncoso o\n\ngx\ny x –\n\n2 v\nθ\n\nθ\n=\n\n       The maximum height that a projectile attains is :\n\nlim\n\nlim\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS84\n\nh\nv\n\n2g\nm\n\no o\n=\n\n( ) sin\n2\n\nq\n\nThe time taken to reach this height is :\n\ng\n\nv\nt oom\n\nθsin \n=\n\nThe horizontal distance travelled by a projectile from its initial position to the position\nit passes y = 0 during its fall is called the range, R of the projectile.  It is :\n\n2\n\nsin2o o\nv\n\nR\ng\n\nθ=\n\n17. When an object follows a circular path at constant speed, the motion of the object is\ncalled uniform circular motion. The magnitude of its acceleration is   a\n\nc\n = v2 /R. The\n\ndirection of a\nc\n is always towards the centre of the circle.\n\nThe angular speed ω, is the rate of change of angular distance. It is related to velocity\nv by   v = ω R.  The acceleration is a\n\nc\n = ω 2R.\n\nIf T is the time period of revolution of the object in circular motion and ν is its\nfrequency, we have ω = 2π ν, v = 2πνR,  a\n\nc\n = 4π2ν2R\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMOTION IN A PLANE 85\n\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n\n1. The path length traversed by an object between two points is, in general, not the same as\nthe magnitude of displacement. The displacement depends only on the end points; the\npath length (as the name implies) depends on the actual path. The two quantities are\nequal only if the object does not change its direction during the course of motion. In all\nother cases, the path length is greater than the magnitude of displacement.\n\n2. In view of point 1 above, the average speed of an object is greater than or equal to the\nmagnitude of the average velocity over a given time interval. The two are equal only if the\npath length is equal to the magnitude of displacement.\n\n3. The vector equations (4.33a) and (4.34a) do not involve any choice of axes. Of course,\nyou can always resolve them along any two independent axes.\n\n4. The kinematic equations for uniform acceleration do not apply to the case of uniform\ncircular motion since in this case the magnitude of acceleration is constant but its\ndirection is changing.\n\n5. An object subjected to two velocities v\n1\n and v\n\n2\n has a resultant velocity v = v\n\n1\n + v\n\n2\n. Take\n\ncare to distinguish it from velocity of object 1 relative to velocity of object 2 : v\n12\n\n= v\n1\n − v\n\n2\n.\n\nHere v\n1\n and v\n\n2\n are velocities with reference to some common reference frame.\n\n6.
