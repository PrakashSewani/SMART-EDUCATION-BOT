The result of a\nmeasurement of a physical quantity is expressed by a\nnumber (or numerical measure) accompanied by a unit.\nAlthough the number of physical quantities appears to be\nvery large, we need only a limited number of units for\nexpressing all the physical quantities, since they are inter-\nrelated with one another. The units for the fundamental or\nbase quantities are called fundamental or base units. The\nunits of all other physical quantities can be expressed as\ncombinations of the base units. Such units obtained for the\nderived quantities are called derived units. A complete set\nof these units, both the base units and derived units, is\nknown as the system of units.\n\n2.2  THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM OF UNITS\nIn earlier time scientists of different countries were using\ndifferent systems of units for measurement. Three such\nsystems, the CGS, the FPS (or British) system and the MKS\nsystem were in use extensively till recently.\n\nThe base units for length, mass and time in these systems\nwere as follows :\n• In CGS system they were centimetre, gram and second\n\nrespectively.\n• In FPS system they were foot, pound and second\n\nrespectively.\n• In MKS system they were metre, kilogram and second\n\nrespectively.\nThe system of units which is at present internationally\n\naccepted for measurement is the Système Internationale\nd’ Unites (French for International System of Units),\nabbreviated as SI. The SI, with standard scheme of symbols,\nunits and abbreviations, developed by the Bureau\nInternational des Poids et measures (The International\nBureau of Weights and Measures, BIPM) in 1971 were\nrecently revised by the General Conference on Weights and\nMeasures in November 2018. The scheme is now for\n\n2.1 Introduction\n\n2.2 The international system of\nunits\n\n2.3 Measurement of length\n\n2.4 Measurement of mass\n\n2.5 Measurement of time\n\n2.6 Accuracy, precision of\ninstruments and errors in\nmeasurement\n\n2.7 Significant figures\n\n2.8 Dimensions of physical\nquantities\n\n2.9 Dimensional formulae and\ndimensional equations\n\n2.10 Dimensional analysis and its\napplications\n\nSummary\nExercises\nAdditional exercises\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTable 2.1   SI Base Quantities  and  Units*\n\ninternational usage in scientific, technical, industrial\nand commercial work.  Because SI units used decimal\nsystem, conversions within the system are quite simple\nand convenient.  We shall follow the SI units in this\nbook.\n\nIn SI, there are seven base units as given in Table\n2.1. Besides the seven base units, there are two more\nunits that are defined for (a) plane angle dθ as the ratio\nof length of arc ds to the radius r and (b) solid angle dΩ\nas the ratio of the intercepted area dA of the spherical\nsurface, described about the apex O as the centre, to\nthe square of its radius r, as shown in Fig. 2.1(a) and\n(b) respectively.  The unit for plane angle is radian with\nthe symbol rad and the unit for the solid angle is\nsteradian with the symbol sr. Both these are\ndimensionless quantities.\n\nUNITS AND MEASUREMENT 17\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\nFig. 2.1 Description of (a) plane angle dθ\n\nand (b) solid angle dΩ .\n\nBase                                                        SI Units\n\nquantity Name Symbol Definition\n\nLength metre m The metre, symbol m, is the SI unit of length. It is defined by taking the\nfixed numerical value of the speed of light in vacuum c to be 299792458\nwhen expressed in the unit m s–1, where the second is defined in terms of\nthe caesium frequency ∆νcs.\n\nMass kilogram kg The kilogram, symbol kg, is the SI unit of mass. It is defined by taking the\nfixed numerical value of the Planck constant h to be 6.62607015×10–34 when\nexpressed in the unit J s, which is equal to kg m2 s–1, where the metre and\nthe second are defined in terms of c and ∆νcs.\n\nTime second s The second, symbol s, is the SI unit of time. It is defined by taking the fixed\nnumerical value of the caesium frequency ∆νcs, the unperturbed ground-\nstate hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium-133 atom, to be\n9192631770 when expressed in the unit Hz, which is equal to s–1.\n\nElectric ampere A The ampere, symbol A, is the SI unit of electric current. It is defined by\ntaking the fixed numerical value of the elementary charge e to be\n1.602176634×10–19 when expressed in the unit C, which is equal to A s,\nwhere the second is defined in terms of ∆νcs.\n\nThermo kelvin K The kelvin, symbol K, is the SI unit of thermodynamic temperature.\ndynamic It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the Boltzmann constant\nTemperature k to be 1.380649×10–23 when expressed in the unit J K–1, which is equal to\n\nkg m2 s–2 k–1, where the kilogram, metre and second are defined in terms of\nh, c and ∆νcs.\n\nAmount of mole mol The mole, symbol mol, is the SI unit of amount of substance. One mole\nsubstance contains exactly 6.02214076×1023 elementary entities. This number is the\n\nfixed numerical value of the Avogadro constant, N\nA\n, when expressed in the\n\nunit mol–1 and is called the Avogadro number. The amount of substance,\nsymbol n, of a system is a measure of the number of specified elementary\nentities. An elementary entity may be an atom, a molecule, an ion, an electron,\nany other particle or specified group of particles.\n\nLuminous candela cd The candela, symbol cd, is the SI unit of luminous intensity in given direction.\nintensity It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the luminous efficacy of\n\nmonochromatic radiation of frequency 540×1012 Hz, K\ncd\n, to be 683 when expressed\n\nin the unit lm W–1, which is equal to cd sr W–1, or cd sr kg–1m–2s3, where the\nkilogram, metre and second are defined in terms of h, c and ∆νcs.\n\n* The values mentioned here need not be remembered or asked in a test. They are given here only to\nindicate the extent of accuracy to which they are measured. With progress in technology, the measuring\n\ntechniques get improved leading to measurements with greater precision. The definitions of base units\n\nare revised to keep up with this progress.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS18\n\nTable 2.2   Some units retained for general use (Though outside SI)\n\nNote that when mole is used, the elementary\nentities  must  be specified.  These  entities\nmay be atoms, molecules, ions, electrons,\nother particles or specified groups of such\nparticles.\n\nWe employ units  for  some  physical quantities\nthat can be derived from the seven base units\n(Appendix A 6). Some derived units in terms of\nthe SI base units are given in (Appendix A 6.1).\nSome SI derived units are given special names\n(Appendix A  6.2 ) and some derived SI units make\nuse of these units with special names and the\nseven base units  (Appendix A 6.3). These are\ngiven in Appendix A 6.2 and A 6.3 for your ready\nreference. Other units retained for general use\nare given in Table 2.2.\n\nCommon SI prefixes and symbols for multiples\nand sub-multiples are given in Appendix A2.\nGeneral  guidelines for using symbols for physical\nquantities, chemical elements and nuclides are\ngiven in Appendix A7 and those for SI units and\nsome other units  are given in Appendix A8 for\nyour guidance and ready reference.\n\n2.3  MEASUREMENT OF LENGTH\n\nYou are already familiar with some direct methods\nfor the measurement of length.  For example, a\nmetre scale is used for lengths from 10–3 m to 102\n\nm.  A vernier callipers is used for lengths to an\naccuracy of 10–4 m.  A screw gauge and a\nspherometer can be used to measure lengths as\nless as to 10–5 m. To measure lengths beyond these\nranges, we make use of some special indirect\nmethods.\n\n2.3.1  Measurement of Large Distances\n\nLarge distances such as the distance of a planet\nor a star from the earth cannot be measured\ndirectly with a metre scale. An important method\nin such cases is the parallax method.\n\nWhen you hold a pencil in front of you against\nsome specific point on the background (a wall)\nand look at the pencil first through your left eye\nA (closing the right eye) and then look at the\npencil through your right eye B (closing the left\neye), you would notice that the position of the\npencil seems to change with respect to the point\non the wall.  This is called parallax.  The\ndistance between the two points of observation\nis called the basis. In this example, the basis is\nthe distance between the eyes.\n\nTo measure the distance D of a far away\nplanet S by the parallax method, we observe it\nfrom two different positions (observatories) A and\nB on the  Earth,  separated  by distance AB = b\nat the same time as shown in Fig. 2.2.  We\nmeasure the angle between the two directions\nalong which the planet is viewed at these two\npoints. The ∠ASB in Fig. 2.2 represented by\nsymbol θ is called the parallax angle or\nparallactic angle.\n\nAs the planet is very far away,  1,\nb\n\nD\n<<  and\n\ntherefore, θ  is very small.  Then we\napproximately take AB as an arc of length b of a\ncircle with centre at S and the distance D as\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nUNITS AND MEASUREMENT 19\n\n\uf074\n\n\uf074\n\n\uf074\n\n\uf074\n\nthe radius  AS = BS so that AB = b = D θ  where\nθ  is in radians.\n\n   D =  \nb\n\nθ\n(2.1)\n\nHaving determined D, we can employ a similar\nmethod to determine the size or angular diameter\nof the planet. If d is the diameter of the planet\nand α  the angular size of the planet (the angle\nsubtended by d at the earth), we have\n\nα = d/D (2.2)\nThe angle α  can be measured from the same\n\nlocation on the earth.  It is the angle between\nthe two directions when two diametrically\nopposite  points  of the planet are viewed through\nthe telescope.  Since D is known, the diameter d\nof the planet can be determined using Eq. (2.2).\n\nExample 2.1  Calculate the angle of\n(a) 10 (degree) (b) 1′ (minute of arc or arcmin)\nand (c) 1″(second of arc or arc second) in\nradians. Use 3600=2π rad, 10=60′ and\n1′ = 60 ″\n\nAnswer  (a) We have 3600 = 2π rad\n10 = (π /180) rad = 1.745×10–2 rad\n\n(b) 10 = 60′ = 1.745×10–2 rad\n1′ = 2.908×10–4 rad \uf001  2.91×10–4 rad\n\n(c) 1′ = 60″ = 2.908×10–4 rad\n1″ = 4.847×10–4 rad \uf001  4.85×10–6 rad \uf074\n\nExample 2.2  A man wishes to estimate\nthe distance of a nearby tower from him.\nHe stands at a point A in front of the tower\nC and spots a very distant object O in line\nwith AC. He then walks perpendicular to\nAC up to B, a distance of 100 m, and looks\nat O and C again. Since O is very distant,\nthe direction BO is practically the same as\n\nAO; but he finds the line of sight of C shifted\nfrom the original line of sight by an angle θ\n= 400  (θ is known as ‘parallax’) estimate\nthe distance of the tower C from his original\nposition A.\n\nFig. 2.3\n\nAnswer  We have, parallax angle θ  = 400\nFrom Fig. 2.3, AB = AC tan θ\nAC = AB/tanθ  = 100 m/tan 400\n= 100 m/0.8391 = 119 m \uf074\n\nExample 2.3  The moon is observed from\ntwo diametrically opposite points A and B\non Earth.  The angle θ  subtended at the\nmoon by the two directions of observation\nis 1o 54′. Given the diameter of the Earth to\nbe about 1.276 ×××××     107 m, compute the\ndistance of the moon from the Earth.\n\nAnswer  We have θ  = 1° 54′ = 114′\n\n( ) ( )-6114 60 4.85 10= ′′× × ×   rad\n=  3.32 ×\n\n−\n10\n\n2\nrad,\n\nsince  \n61 4.85 10 .=" rad−×\n\nAlso  b = AB =1.276 m×107\n\nHence from Eq.

We cannot use a screw gauge\nor similar instruments. Even a microscope has\ncertain limitations.  An optical microscope uses\nvisible light to ‘look’ at the system under\ninvestigation.  As light has wave like features,\nthe resolution to which an optical microscope\ncan be used is the wavelength of light (A detailed\nexplanation can be found in the Class XII\nPhysics textbook). For visible light the range of\nwavelengths  is from about 4000 Å to 7000 Å\n(1 angstrom = 1 Å = 10-10 m). Hence an optical\nmicroscope cannot resolve particles with sizes\nsmaller than this. Instead of visible light, we can\nuse an electron beam.  Electron beams can be\nfocussed by properly designed electric and\nmagnetic fields. The resolution of such an\nelectron microscope is limited finally by the fact\nthat electrons can also behave as waves ! (You\nwill learn more about this in class XII). The\nwavelength of an electron can be as small as a\nfraction of an angstrom.  Such electron\nmicroscopes with a resolution of 0.6 Å have been\nbuilt. They can almost resolve atoms and\nmolecules in a material. In recent times,\ntunnelling microscopy has been developed in\nwhich again the limit of resolution is better than\nan angstrom. It is possible to estimate the sizes\nof molecules.\n\nA simple method for estimating the molecular\nsize of oleic acid is given below. Oleic acid is a\nsoapy liquid with large molecular size of the\norder of 10–9 m.\n\nThe idea is to first form mono-molecular layer\nof oleic acid on water surface.\n\nWe dissolve 1 cm3 of oleic acid in alcohol to\nmake a solution of 20 cm3. Then we take 1 cm3\n\nof this solution and dilute it to 20 cm3, using\nalcohol. So, the concentration of the solution is\n\nequal to \n1\n\n20 20\n3\n\n×\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\ncm  of oleic acid/cm3 of\n\nsolution. Next we lightly sprinkle some\nlycopodium powder on the surface of water in a\nlarge trough and we put one drop of this solution\nin the water. The oleic acid drop spreads into a\nthin, large and roughly circular film of molecular\nthickness on water surface. Then, we quickly\nmeasure the diameter of the thin film to get its\narea A. Suppose we have dropped n drops in\nthe water. Initially, we determine the\napproximate volume of each drop (V cm3).\n\nVolume of n drops of solution\n                             = nV cm3\n\nAmount of oleic acid in this solution\n\n                             = nV \n1\n\n20 20×\n\n\uf001\n\n\uf005\n\uf003\n\n\uf002\n\n\uf006\n\uf004 cm\n\n3\n\nThis solution of oleic acid spreads very fast\non the surface of water and forms a very thin\nlayer of thickness t.  If this spreads to form a\nfilm of area A cm2, then the thickness of the\nfilm\n\nt =\nVolume of the film\n\nArea of the film\n\nor, cm20 20 \nnV\n\nt\nA\n\n=\n× (2.3)\n\nIf we assume that the film has mono-molecular\nthickness, then this becomes the size or diameter\nof a molecule of oleic acid. The value of this\nthickness comes out to be of the order of 10–9 m.\n\nExample 2.5  If the size of a nucleus (in\nthe range of 10–15 to 10–14 m) is scaled up\nto the tip of a sharp pin, what roughly is\nthe size of an atom ? Assume tip of the pin\nto be in the range 10–5m to 10–4m.\n\nAnswer  The size of a nucleus is in the range of\n10–15 m and 10–14 m.  The tip of a sharp pin is\ntaken to be in the range of 10–5 m and 10–4 m.\nThus we are scaling up by a factor of 1010. An\natom roughly of size 10–10 m will be scaled up to a\nsize of 1 m. Thus a nucleus in an atom is as small\nin size as the tip of a sharp pin placed at the centre\nof a sphere of radius about a metre long. \uf074\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nUNITS AND MEASUREMENT 21\n\n2.3.3  Range of Lengths\n\nThe sizes of the objects we come across in the\nuniverse vary over a very wide range. These may\nvary from the size of the order of 10–14 m of the\ntiny nucleus of an atom to the size of the order\nof 1026 m of the extent of the observable universe.\nTable 2.3 gives the range and order of lengths\nand sizes of some of these objects.\n\nWe also use certain special length units for\nshort and large lengths. These are\n1 fermi = 1 f = 10–15 m\n1 angstrom = 1 Å = 10–10 m\n1 astronomical unit = 1 AU (average distance\n\n    of the Sun from the Earth)\n= 1.496 × 1011 m\n\n1 light year = 1 ly= 9.46 × 1015 m (distance\n   that light travels with velocity of\n\n   3 × 108 m s–1 in 1 year)\n1 parsec = 3.08 × 1016 m (Parsec is the\ndistance at which average radius of earth’s orbit\nsubtends an angle of 1 arc second)\n\n2.4  MEASUREMENT OF MASS\n\nMass is a basic property of matter.  It does not\ndepend on the temperature, pressure or location\nof the object in space. The SI unit of mass is\nkilogram (kg). It is defined by taking the fixed\nnumerical value of the Plank Constant h to be\n6.62607015×10–34 when expressed in the unit of\nJs which is equal to kg m2s–1, where the\nmetre and the second are defined is terms of C\nand ∆νcs.\n\nWhile dealing with atoms and molecules, the\nkilogram is an inconvenient unit. In this case,\nthere is an important standard unit of mass,\ncalled the unified atomic mass unit (u), which\nhas been established for expressing the mass\nof atoms as\n\n1 unified atomic mass unit = 1u\n    = (1/12) of the mass of an atom of  carbon-12\nisotope ( )612 C  including the mass  of electrons\n    = 1.66 × 10–27  kg\n\nMass of commonly available objects can be\ndetermined by a common balance like the one\nused in a grocery shop. Large masses in the\nuniverse like planets, stars, etc., based on\nNewton’s law of gravitation can be measured by\nusing gravitational method (See Chapter 8). For\nmeasurement of small masses of atomic/sub-\natomic particles etc., we make use of mass\nspectrograph in which radius of the trajectory\nis proportional to the mass of a charged particle\nmoving in uniform  electric and magnetic field.\n\n2.4.1  Range of  Masses\n\nThe masses of the objects, we come across in\nthe universe, vary over a very wide range.  These\nmay vary from tiny  mass of the order of 10-30 kg\nof an electron to the huge mass of about 1055 kg\nof the known universe. Table 2.4 gives the range\nand order of the typical masses of various\nobjects.\n\nTable 2.3  Range and order of lengths\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS22\n\nTable 2.4  Range and order of masses\n\n2.5   MEASUREMENT OF TIME\nTo measure any time interval we need a clock.\nWe now use an atomic standard of time, which\nis based on the periodic vibrations produced in\na cesium atom. This is the basis of the caesium\nclock, sometimes called atomic clock, used in\nthe national standards. Such standards are\navailable in many laboratories. In the caesium\natomic clock, the second is taken as the time\nneeded for 9,192,631,770 vibrations of the\nradiation corresponding to the transition\nbetween the two hyperfine levels of the ground\nstate of caesium-133 atom. The vibrations of the\ncaesium atom regulate the rate of this caesium\natomic clock just as the vibrations of a balance\nwheel regulate an ordinary wristwatch or the\nvibrations of a small quartz crystal regulate a\nquartz wristwatch.\n\nThe caesium atomic clocks are very accurate.\nIn principle they provide portable standard.  The\nnational standard of time interval ‘second’ as\nwell as the frequency is maintained through four\ncesium atomic clocks.  A caesium atomic clock\nis used at the National Physical Laboratory\n(NPL), New Delhi to  maintain the Indian\nstandard of time.\n\nIn our country, the NPL has the responsibility\nof maintenance and improvement of physical\nstandards, including that of time, frequency, etc.\nNote that the Indian Standard Time (IST) is\nlinked to this set of atomic clocks. The efficient\ncaesium atomic clocks are so accurate that they\nimpart the uncertainty in time realisation as\n\n± 1 × 10–15, i.e. 1 part in 1015.  This implies that\nthe uncertainty gained over time by such a\ndevice is less than 1 part in 1015; they lose or\ngain no more than 32 µs in one year. In view of\nthe tremendous accuracy in time measurement,\nthe SI unit of length has been expressed in terms\nthe path length light travels in certain interval\nof time (1/299, 792, 458 of a second) (Table 2.1).\n\nThe time interval of events that we come\nacross in the universe vary over a very wide\nrange. Table 2.5 gives the range and order of\nsome typical time intervals.\n\nYou may notice that there is an interesting\ncoincidence between the numbers appearing\nin Tables 2.3 and 2.5. Note that the ratio of the\nlongest and shortest lengths of objects in our\nuniverse is about 1041. Interestingly enough,\nthe ratio of the longest and shortest time\nintervals associated with the events and objects\nin our universe is also about 1041. This number,\n1041 comes up again in Table 2.4, which lists\ntypical masses of objects. The ratio of the\nlargest and smallest masses of the objects in\nour universe is about (1041)2. Is this a curious\ncoincidence between these large numbers\npurely accidental ?\n\n2.6 ACCURACY, PRECISION OF INSTRUMENTS\nAND ERRORS IN MEASUREMENT\n\nMeasurement is the foundation of all\nexperimental science and technology. The result\nof every measurement by any measuring\ninstrument contains some uncertainty. This\nuncertainty is called error. Every calculated\nquantity which is based on measured values,\nalso has an error. We shall distinguish between\ntwo terms: accuracy and precision. The\naccuracy of a measurement is a measure of how\nclose the measured value is to the true value of\nthe quantity. Precision tells us to what resolution\nor limit the quantity is measured.\n\nThe accuracy in measurement may depend on\nseveral factors, including the limit or the resolution\nof the measuring instrument. For example, suppose\nthe true value of a certain length is near 3.678 cm.\nIn one experiment, using a measuring instrument\nof resolution 0.1 cm, the measured value is found to\nbe 3.5 cm, while in another experiment using a\nmeasuring device of greater resolution, say 0.01 cm,\nthe length is determined to be 3.38 cm. The first\nmeasurement has more accuracy (because it is\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nUNITS AND MEASUREMENT 23\n\ncloser to the true value) but less precision (its\nresolution is only 0.1 cm), while the\nsecond measurement is less accurate but\nmore precise. Thus every measurement is\napproximate due to errors in measurement. In\ngeneral, the errors in measurement can be\nbroadly classified as (a) systematic errors and\n(b) random errors.\n\nSystematic errors\n\nThe systematic errors are those errors that\ntend to be in one direction, either positive or\nnegative. Some of the sources of systematic\nerrors are :\n\n(a) Instrumental errors that arise from the\nerrors due to imperfect design or calibration\nof the measuring instrument, zero error in\nthe instrument, etc. For example, the\ntemperature graduations of a thermometer\nmay be inadequately calibrated (it may read\n104 °C at the boiling point of water at STP\nwhereas it should read 100 °C); in a vernier\ncallipers the zero mark of vernier scale may\nnot coincide with the zero mark of the main\nscale, or simply an ordinary metre scale may\nbe worn off at one end.\n\n(b) Imperfection in experimental technique\nor procedure To determine the temperature\n\nof a human body, a thermometer placed\nunder the armpit will always give a\ntemperature lower than the actual value of\nthe body temperature. Other external\nconditions (such as changes in temperature,\nhumidity, wind velocity, etc.) during the\nexperiment may systematically affect the\nmeasurement.\n\n(c) Personal errors that arise due to an\nindividual’s bias, lack of proper setting of\nthe apparatus or individual’s carelessness\nin taking observations without observing\nproper precautions, etc. For example, if you,\nby habit, always hold your head a bit too far\nto the right while reading the position of a\nneedle on the scale, you will introduce an\nerror due to parallax.\n\nSystematic errors can be minimised by\nimproving experimental techniques, selecting\nbetter instruments and removing personal bias\nas far as possible. For a given set-up, these\nerrors may be estimated to a certain extent and\nthe necessary corrections may be applied to the\nreadings.\n\nRandom errors\n\nThe random errors are those errors, which occur\nirregularly and hence are random with respect\n\nTable 2.5   Range and order of time intervals\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS24\n\nto sign and size. These can arise due to random\nand unpredictable fluctuations in experimental\nconditions (e.g. unpredictable fluctuations in\ntemperature, voltage supply, mechanical\nvibrations of experimental set-ups, etc), personal\n(unbiased) errors by the observer taking\nreadings, etc. For example, when the same\nperson repeats the same observation, it is very\nlikely that he may get different readings\neverytime.\n\nLeast count error\n\nThe smallest value that can be measured by the\nmeasuring instrument is called its least count.\nAll the readings or measured values are good only\nup to this value.\n\nThe least count error is the error\nassociated with the resolution of the instrument.\nFor example, a vernier callipers has the least\ncount as 0.01cm; a spherometer may have a\nleast count of 0.001 cm. Least count error\nbelongs to the category of random errors but\nwithin a limited size; it occurs with both\nsystematic and random errors. If we use a metre\nscale for measurement of length, it may have\ngraduations at 1 mm division scale spacing or\ninterval.\n\nUsing instruments of higher precision,\nimproving experimental techniques, etc., we can\nreduce the least count error. Repeating the\nobservations several times and taking the\narithmetic mean of all the observations, the\nmean value would be very close to the true value\nof the measured quantity.\n\n2.6.1 Absolute Error, Relative Error and\nPercentage Error\n\n(a) Suppose the values obtained in several\nmeasurements are a\n\n1\n, a\n\n2\n, a\n\n3\n...., a\n\nn\n.  The\n\narithmetic mean of these values is taken as\nthe best possible value of the quantity under\nthe given conditions of measurement as :\n\na\nmean\n\n = (a\n1\n+a\n\n2\n+a\n\n3\n+...+a\n\nn\n ) / n (2.4)\n\nor,\n\na a / n\nmean i\n\ni 1\n\nn\n\n=\n=\n\uf007 (2.5)\n\nThis is because, as explained earlier, it is\nreasonable to suppose that individual\nmeasurements are as likely to overestimate\n\nas to underestimate the true value of the\nquantity.\n\nThe magnitude of the difference\n\nbetween the individual measurement and\n\nthe true value of the quantity is called the\n\nabsolute error of the measurement. This\nis denoted by |∆a |. In absence of any other\nmethod of knowing true value, we considered\narithmatic mean as the true value.  Then the\nerrors in the individual measurement values\nfrom the true value, are\n\n∆a\n1\n  = a\n\n1\n – a\n\nmean\n,\n\n∆a\n2\n  = a\n\n2\n – a\n\nmean\n,\n\n....      ....      ....\n\n....      ....      ....\n∆a \n\nn\n = a\n\nn\n – a\n\nmean\n\nThe ∆a calculated above may be positive in\ncertain cases and negative in some other\ncases. But absolute error |∆a| will always\nbe positive.\n\n(b) The arithmetic mean of all the absolute errors\nis taken as the final or mean absolute error\nof the value of the physical quantity a. It is\nrepresented by ∆a\n\nmean\n.\n\nThus,\n\n∆a\nmean\n\n = (|∆a\n1\n|+|∆a\n\n2\n |+|∆a\n\n3\n|+...+ |∆a\n\nn\n|)/n\n\n(2.6)\n\n=\n=\n\uf007\ni 1\n\nn\n\n|∆a\ni\n|/n (2.7)\n\nIf we do a single measurement, the value we\nget may be in the range a\n\nmean\n ±  ∆a\n\nmean\n\ni.e.      a = a\nmean\n\n ±  ∆a\nmean\n\nor,\n     a\n\nmean\n – ∆a\n\nmean\n ≤ a  ≤ a\n\nmean\n + ∆a\n\nmean\n\n(2.8)\n\nThis implies that any measurement of the\nphysical quantity a is likely to lie between\n\n(a\nmean\n\n+ ∆a\nmean\n\n)  and  (a\nmean\n\n− ∆a\nmean\n\n).\n(c) Instead of the absolute error, we often use\n\nthe relative error or the percentage error\n(δa).  The relative error is the ratio of the\nmean absolute error ∆∆∆∆∆a\n\nmean\n to the mean\n\nvalue a\nmean \n\nof the quantity measured.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nUNITS AND MEASUREMENT 25\n\n\uf074\n\n\uf074\n\nRelative error = ∆a\nmean\n\n/a\nmean\n\n(2.9)\n\nWhen the relative error is expressed in per\ncent, it is called the percentage error (δa).\n\nThus, Percentage error\n\nδa = (∆a\nmean\n\n/a\nmean\n\n) × 100% (2.10)\n\nLet us now consider an example.\n\nExample 2.6  Two clocks are being tested\nagainst a standard clock located in a\nnational laboratory.  At 12:00:00 noon by\nthe standard clock, the readings of the two\nclocks are :\n\nClock 1 Clock 2\n\nMonday 12:00:05 10:15:06\nTuesday 12:01:15 10:14:59\nWednesday 11:59:08 10:15:18\nThursday 12:01:50 10:15:07\nFriday 11:59:15 10:14:53\nSaturday 12:01:30 10:15:24\nSunday 12:01:19 10:15:11\n\nIf you are doing an experiment that requires\nprecision time interval measurements, which\nof the two clocks will you prefer ?\n\nAnswer   The range of variation over the seven\ndays of observations is 162 s for clock 1, and\n31 s for clock 2.  The average reading of clock 1\nis much closer to the standard time than the\naverage reading of clock 2.  The important point\nis that a clock’s zero error is not as significant\nfor precision work as its variation, because a\n‘zero-error’ can always be easily corrected.\nHence clock 2 is to be preferred to clock 1. \uf020\uf020\uf074\n\nExample 2.7  We measure the period of\noscillation of a simple pendulum.  In\nsuccessive measurements, the readings\nturn out to be 2.63 s, 2.56 s, 2.42 s, 2.71s\nand 2.80 s. Calculate the absolute errors,\nrelative error or percentage error.\n\nAnswer   The mean period of oscillation of the\npendulum\n\n( )\nT =\n\n+ + + +2.63 2.56 2.42 2.71 2.80 s\n\n5\n\n= \n13.12\n\n5\n s\n\n= 2.624  s\n= 2.62  s\n\nAs the periods are measured to a resolution\nof 0.01 s, all times are to the second decimal; it\nis proper to put this mean period also to the\nsecond decimal.\n\nThe errors in the measurements are\n\n2.63 s – 2.62 s =   0.01 s\n2.56 s – 2.62 s = – 0.06 s\n2.42 s – 2.62 s = – 0.20 s\n2.71 s – 2.62 s =    0.09 s\n2.80 s – 2.62 s =    0.18 s\n\nNote that the errors have the same units as the\nquantity to be measured.\n\nThe arithmetic mean of all the absolute errors\n(for arithmetic mean, we take only the\nmagnitudes) is\n\n∆Τ\nmean\n\n = [(0.01+ 0.06+0.20+0.09+0.18)s]/5\n              = 0.54 s/5\n              = 0.11 s\n\nThat means, the period of oscillation of the\nsimple pendulum is (2.62 ± 0.11) s i.e. it lies\nbetween (2.62 + 0.11) s and (2.62 – 0.11) s or\nbetween 2.73 s and 2.51 s.  As the arithmetic\nmean of all the absolute errors is 0.11 s, there\nis already an error in the tenth of a second.\nHence there is no point in giving the period to a\nhundredth.  A more correct way will be to write\n\n             T = 2.6 ± 0.1 s\n\nNote that the last numeral 6 is unreliable, since\nit may be anything between 5 and 7. We indicate\nthis by saying that the measurement has two\nsignificant figures. In this case, the two\nsignificant figures are 2, which is reliable and\n6, which has an error associated with it.  You\nwill learn more about the significant figures in\nsection 2.7.\n\nFor this example, the relative error or the\npercentage error is\n\nδa = × =\n01\n\n100 4\n.\n\n2.6\n%              \uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf074\n\n2.6.2  Combination of Errors\n\nIf we do an experiment involving several\nmeasurements, we must know how the errors\nin all the measurements combine.  For example,\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS26\n\n\uf074\n\nmass density is obtained by deviding mass by\nthe volume of the substance. If we have errors\nin the measurement of mass and of the sizes or\ndimensions, we must know what the error will\nbe in the density of the substance. To make such\nestimates, we should learn how errors combine\nin various mathematical operations. For this,\nwe use the following procedure.\n\n(a)  Error of a sum or a difference\n\nSuppose two physical quantities A and B have\nmeasured values A ± ∆A, B ± ∆B respectively\nwhere ∆A and ∆B are their absolute errors. We\nwish to find the error ∆Z in the sum\n\nZ = A + B.\nWe have by addition, Z ± ∆Z\n\n= (A ± ∆A) + (B ± ∆B).\nThe maximum possible error in Z\n\n∆Z = ∆A + ∆B\nFor the difference Z = A – B,  we have\n                    Z ± ∆ Z =  (A ± ∆A) – (B ± ∆B)\n                                = (A – B) ± ∆A ± ∆B\n\nor, ± ∆Z =  ± ∆A ± ∆B\nThe maximum value of the error ∆Z  is again\n∆A + ∆B.\n\nHence the rule : When two quantities are\nadded or subtracted, the absolute error in the\n\nfinal result is the sum of the absolute errors\n\nin the individual quantities.\n\nExample 2.8  The temperatures of two\nbodies measured by a thermometer are\nt\n1\n = 20 0C ± 0.5 0C and t\n\n2\n = 50 0C ± 0.5 0C.\n\nCalculate the temperature difference and\nthe error theirin.\n\nAnswer  t′ = t\n2\n–t\n\n1\n = (50 0C±0.5 0C)– (200C±0.5 0C)\n\n t′ = 30 0C ± 1 0C \uf074\n(b)  Error of a product or a quotient\n\nSuppose Z = AB and the measured values of A\nand B are A ± ∆A and B ± ∆B. Then\n\nZ ± ∆Z = (A ± ∆A)  (B ± ∆B)\n                     = AB ± B ∆A ± A ∆B ± ∆A ∆B.\n\nDividing LHS by Z and RHS by AB we have,\n\n1±(∆Z/Z) = 1 ± (∆A/A) ± (∆B/B) ± (∆A/A)(∆B/B).\n\nSince ∆A and ∆B are small, we shall ignore their\nproduct.\n\nHence the maximum relative error\n\n∆Z/ Z = (∆A/A) + (∆B/B).\nYou can easily verify that this is true for division\nalso.\n\nHence the rule : When two quantities are\nmultiplied or divided, the relative error in the\nresult is the sum of the relative errors in the\nmultipliers.\n\nHow will you measure the length of a line?\n\nWhat a naïve question, at this stage, you might\nsay! But what if it is not a straight line? Draw\na zigzag line in your copy, or on the blackboard.\nWell, not too difficult again. You might take a\nthread, place it along the line, open up the\nthread, and measure its length.\n\nNow imagine that you want to measure the\nlength of a national highway, a river, the railway\ntrack between two stations, or the boundary\nbetween two states or two nations. If you take\na string of length 1 metre or 100 metre, keep it\nalong the line, shift its position every time, the\narithmetic of man-hours of labour and expenses\non the project is not commensurate with the\noutcome. Moreover, errors are bound to occur\nin this enormous task. There is an interesting\nfact about this. France and Belgium share a\ncommon international boundary, whose length\nmentioned in the official documents of the two\ncountries differs substantially!\n\nGo one step beyond and imagine the\ncoastline where land meets sea. Roads and rivers\nhave fairly mild bends as compared to a\ncoastline. Even so, all documents, including our\nschool books, contain information on the length\nof the coastline of Gujarat or Andhra Pradesh,\nor the common boundary between two states,\netc. Railway tickets come with the distance\nbetween stations printed on them. We have\n‘milestones’ all along the roads indicating the\ndistances to various towns. So, how is it done?\n\nOne has to decide how much error one can\ntolerate and optimise cost-effectiveness. If you\nwant smaller errors, it will involve high\ntechnology and high costs. Suffice it to say that\nit requires fairly advanced level of physics,\nmathematics, engineering and technology. It\nbelongs to the areas of fractals, which has lately\nbecome popular in theoretical physics. Even\nthen one doesn’t know how much to rely on\nthe figure that props up, as is clear from the\nstory of France and Belgium. Incidentally, this\nstory of the France-Belgium discrepancy\nappears on the first page of an advanced Physics\nbook on the subject of fractals and chaos!\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nUNITS AND MEASUREMENT 27\n\n\uf074\n\n\uf074\n\n\uf074\n\n\uf074\n\nExample 2.9  The resistance R = V/I where\nV = (100 ± 5)V and I = (10 ± 0.2)A.

Thus, the result of\nmeasurement should be reported in a way that\nindicates the precision of measurement.\nNormally, the reported result of measurement\nis a number that includes all digits in the\nnumber that are known reliably plus the first\ndigit that is uncertain. The reliable digits plus\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS28\n\nthe first uncertain digit are known as\nsignificant digits or significant figures. If we\nsay the period of oscillation of a simple\npendulum is 1.62 s, the digits 1 and 6 are\nreliable and certain, while the digit 2 is\nuncertain. Thus, the measured value has three\nsignificant figures. The length of an object\nreported after measurement to be 287.5 cm has\nfour significant figures, the digits 2, 8, 7 are\ncertain while the digit 5 is uncertain. Clearly,\nreporting the result of measurement that\nincludes more digits than the significant digits\nis superfluous and also misleading since it would\ngive a wrong idea about the precision of\nmeasurement.\n\nThe rules for determining the number of\nsignificant figures can be understood from the\nfollowing examples. Significant figures indicate,\nas already mentioned, the precision of\nmeasurement which depends on the least count\nof the measuring instrument. A choice of\nchange of different units does not change the\nnumber of significant digits or figures in a\nmeasurement. This important remark makes\nmost of the following observations clear:\n(1) For example, the length 2.308 cm has four\nsignificant figures. But in different units, the\nsame value can be written as 0.02308 m or 23.08\nmm or 23080 µm.\n\nAll these numbers have the same number of\nsignificant figures (digits 2, 3, 0, 8), namely four.\nThis shows that the location of decimal point is\nof no consequence in determining the number\nof significant figures.\nThe example gives the following rules :\n• All the non-zero digits are significant.\n• All the zeros between two non-zero digits\n\nare significant, no matter where the\ndecimal point is, if at all.\n\n• If the number is less than 1, the zero(s)\non the right of decimal point but to the\nleft of the first non-zero digit are not\nsignificant. [In 0.00 2308, the underlined\nzeroes are not significant].\n\n• The terminal or trailing zero(s) in a\nnumber without a decimal point are not\nsignificant.\n\n[Thus 123 m = 12300 cm = 123000 mm has\nthree significant figures, the trailing zero(s)\nbeing not significant.] However, you can also\nsee the next observation.\n\n• The trailing zero(s) in a number with a\ndecimal point are significant.\n[The numbers 3.500 or 0.06900 have four\nsignificant figures each.]\n\n(2) There can be some confusion regarding the\ntrailing zero(s). Suppose a length is reported to\nbe 4.700 m. It is evident that the zeroes here\nare meant to convey the precision of\nmeasurement and are, therefore, significant. [If\nthese were not, it would be superfluous to write\nthem explicitly, the reported measurement\nwould have been simply 4.7 m]. Now suppose\nwe change units, then\n\n4.700 m = 470.0 cm = 4700 mm = 0.004700 km\n\nSince the last number has trailing zero(s) in a\nnumber with no decimal, we would conclude\nerroneously from observation (1) above that the\nnumber has two significant figures, while in\nfact, it has four significant figures and a mere\nchange of units cannot change the number of\nsignificant figures.\n\n(3) To remove such ambiguities in\ndetermining the number of significant\nfigures, the best way is to report every\nmeasurement in scientific notation (in the\npower of 10). In this notation, every number is\nexpressed as a × 10b, where a is a number\nbetween 1 and 10, and b is any positive or\nnegative exponent (or power) of 10.  In order to\nget an approximate idea of the number, we may\nround off the number a to 1 (for a ≤ 5) and to 10\n(for 5<a ≤ 10). Then the number can be\nexpressed approximately as 10b in which the\nexponent (or power) b of 10 is called order of\nmagnitude of the physical quantity. When only\nan estimate is required, the quantity is of the\norder of 10b. For example, the diameter of the\nearth (1.28×107m) is of the order of 107m with\nthe order of magnitude 7. The diameter of\nhydrogen atom (1.06 ×10–10m) is of the order of\n10–10m, with the order of magnitude\n–10. Thus, the diameter of the earth is 17 orders\nof magnitude larger than the hydrogen atom.\n\nIt is often customary to write the decimal after\nthe first digit. Now the confusion mentioned in\n(a) above disappears :\n\n 4.700 m = 4.700 × 102 cm\n        = 4.700 × 103 mm = 4.700 × 10–3 km\n\nThe power of 10 is irrelevant to the\ndetermination of significant figures. However, all\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nUNITS AND MEASUREMENT 29\n\nzeroes appearing in the base number in the\nscientific notation are significant. Each number\nin this case has four significant figures.\n\nThus, in the scientific notation, no confusion\narises about the trailing zero(s) in the base\nnumber a. They are always significant.\n\n(4) The scientific notation is ideal for reporting\nmeasurement. But if this is not adopted, we use\nthe rules adopted in the preceding example :\n• For a number greater than 1, without any\n\ndecimal, the trailing zero(s) are not\nsignificant.\n\n• For a number with a decimal, the trailing\n\nzero(s) are significant.\n\n(5) The digit 0 conventionally put on the left of a\ndecimal for a number less than 1 (like 0.1250)\nis never significant. However, the zeroes at the\nend of such number are significant in a\nmeasurement.\n\n(6) The multiplying or dividing factors which are\nneither rounded numbers nor numbers\nrepresenting measured values are exact and\nhave infinite number of significant digits. For\n\nexample in \n2\nd\n\nr =  or  s = 2πr, the factor 2 is an\n\nexact number and it can be written as 2.0, 2.00\n\nor 2.0000 as required. Similarly, in \nt\n\nT\nn\n\n= , n is\n\nan exact number.\n\n2.7.1 Rules for Arithmetic Operations with\nSignificant Figures\n\nThe result of a calculation involving approximate\nmeasured values of quantities (i.e. values with\nlimited number of significant figures) must reflect\nthe uncertainties in the original measured values.\nIt cannot be more accurate than the original\nmeasured values themselves on which the result\nis based. In general, the final result should not\nhave more significant figures than the original\ndata from which it was obtained. Thus, if mass of\nan object is measured to be, say, 4.237 g (four\nsignificant figures) and its volume is measured to\nbe 2.51 cm3, then its density, by mere arithmetic\ndivision, is 1.68804780876 g/cm3 upto 11 decimal\nplaces. It would be clearly absurd and irrelevant\nto record the calculated value of density to such a\nprecision when the measurements on which the\nvalue is based, have much less precision. The\n\nfollowing rules for arithmetic operations with\nsignificant figures ensure that the final result of\na calculation is shown with the precision that is\nconsistent with the precision of the input\nmeasured values :\n(1)  In multiplication or division, the final\nresult should retain as many significant\nfigures as are there in the original number\nwith the least significant figures.\n\nThus, in the example above, density should\nbe reported to three significant figures.\n\nDensity\n4.237g\n\n2.51 cm\n1.69 g cm\n\n3\n-3\n\n= =\n\nSimilarly,  if the speed of light is given as\n3 × 108 m s-1 (one significant figure) and one\nyear (1y = 365.25 d) has 3.1557 × 107 s (five\nsignificant figures), the light year is 9.47 × 1015 m\n(three significant figures).\n\n(2) In addition or subtraction, the final result\nshould retain as many decimal places as are\nthere in the number with the least decimal\nplaces.\n\nFor example, the sum of the numbers\n436.32 g, 227.2 g and 0.301 g by mere arithmetic\naddition,  is 663.821 g. But the least precise\nmeasurement (227.2 g) is correct to only one\ndecimal place. The final result should, therefore,\nbe rounded off to 663.8 g.\n\nSimilarly, the difference in length can be\nexpressed as :\n\n0.307 m – 0.304 m = 0.003 m = 3 × 10–3 m.\n\nNote that we should not use the rule (1)\napplicable for multiplication and division and\nwrite 664 g as the result in the example of\naddition and 3.00 × 10–3 m in the example of\nsubtraction. They do not convey the precision\nof measurement properly. For addition and\nsubtraction, the rule is in terms of decimal\nplaces.\n\n2.7.2   Rounding off the Uncertain Digits\n\nThe result of computation with approximate\nnumbers, which contain more than one\nuncertain digit, should be rounded off.  The rules\nfor rounding off numbers to the appropriate\nsignificant figures are obvious in most cases.  A\nnumber 2.746 rounded off to three significant\nfigures is 2.75, while the number 2.743 would\nbe 2.74.  The rule by convention is that the\npreceding digit is raised by 1 if the\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS30\n\n\uf074\n\n\uf074\n\ninsignificant digit to be dropped (the\n\nunderlined digit in this case)  is more than\n\n5, and is left  unchanged if the latter is less\n\nthan 5.  But what if the number is 2.745 in\nwhich the insignificant digit is 5.  Here, the\nconvention is that if the preceding digit is\neven, the insignificant digit is simply\n\ndropped and, if it is odd, the preceding digit\n\nis raised by 1. Then, the number 2.745 rounded\noff to three significant figures becomes 2.74.  On\nthe other hand, the number 2.735 rounded off\nto three significant figures becomes 2.74 since\nthe preceding digit is odd.\n\nIn any involved or complex multi-step\ncalculation, you should retain, in intermediate\nsteps, one digit more than the significant digits\nand round off to proper significant figures at the\nend of the calculation.  Similarly, a number\nknown to be within many significant figures,\nsuch as in 2.99792458  × 108 m/s for the speed\nof light in vacuum, is rounded off to an\napproximate value 3 × 108 m/s , which is often\nemployed in computations.  Finally, remember\nthat exact numbers that appear in formulae like\n\n2 π in T\nL\n\ng\n= 2π ,  have a large (infinite) number\n\nof significant figures. The value of π =\n3.1415926.... is known to a large number of\nsignificant figures. You may take the  value as\n3.142 or 3.14 for π, with limited number of\nsignificant figures as required in specific\ncases.\n\nExample 2.13  Each side of a cube is\nmeasured to be 7.203 m.  What are the\ntotal surface area and the volume of the\ncube to appropriate significant figures?\n\nAnswer   The number of significant figures in\nthe measured length is 4.  The calculated area\nand the volume should therefore be rounded off\nto 4 significant figures.\n\nSurface area of the cube = 6(7.203)2 m2\n\n= 311.299254 m2\n\n= 311.3 m2\n\nVolume of the cube = (7.203)3  m3\n\n= 373.714754 m3\n\n= 373.7 m3 \uf074\n\nExample 2.14  5.74 g of a substance\noccupies 1.2 cm3.  Express its density by\nkeeping the significant figures in view.\n\nAnswer  There are 3 significant figures in the\nmeasured mass whereas there are only 2\nsignificant figures in the measured  volume.\nHence the density should be expressed to only\n2 significant figures.\n\nDensity = −\n5.74\n1.2\n\ng cm 3\n\n                       = 4.8 g cm--3 . \uf020\uf020\uf074\n\n2.7.3 Rules for Determining the Uncertainty\nin the Results of Arithmatic\nCalculations\n\nThe rules for determining the uncertainty or\nerror in the number/measured quantity in\narithmetic operations can be understood from\nthe following examples.\n(1) If the length and breadth of a thin\nrectangular sheet are measured, using a metre\nscale as 16.2 cm and, 10.1 cm respectively, there\nare three significant figures in each\nmeasurement.  It means that the length l may\nbe written as\n\n                       l = 16.2 ± 0.1  cm\n\n      = 16.2 cm ± 0.6 %.\n\nSimilarly, the breadth b may be written as\n\nb = 10.1  ± 0.1 cm\n\n   = 10.1 cm ± 1 %\n\nThen, the error of the product of two (or more)\nexperimental values, using the combination of\nerrors rule, will be\n\n    l b = 163.62 cm2 + 1.6%\n\n         = 163.62 + 2.6 cm2\n\nThis leads us to quote the final result as\n\nl b = 164 + 3 cm2\n\nHere 3 cm2 is the uncertainty or error in the\nestimation of area of rectangular sheet.\n\n(2) If a set of experimental data is specified\nto n significant figures, a result obtained by\ncombining the data will also be valid to n\nsignificant figures.\n\nHowever, if data are subtracted, the number of\nsignificant figures can be reduced.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nUNITS AND MEASUREMENT 31\n\nFor example, 12.9 g – 7.06 g, both specified to three\nsignificant figures, cannot properly be evaluated\nas 5.84 g but only as 5.8 g, as uncertainties in\nsubtraction or addition combine in a different\nfashion (smallest number of decimal places rather\nthan the number of significant figures in any of\nthe number added or subtracted).\n\n(3) The relative error of a value of number\nspecified to significant figures depends not\nonly on n but also on the number itself.\n\nFor example,  the accuracy  in measurement of\nmass 1.02 g is ± 0.01 g  whereas another\nmeasurement 9.89 g is also accurate to  ± 0.01 g.\nThe relative error in 1.02 g is\n\n= (± 0.01/1.02) × 100 %\n= ± 1%\n\nSimilarly, the relative error in 9.89 g  is\n= (± 0.01/9.89) × 100 %\n\n                   = ± 0.1 %\nFinally, remember that intermediate results in\na multi-step computation should be\n\ncalculated to one more significant figure in\n\nevery measurement than the number of\n\ndigits in the least precise measurement.\n\nThese should be justified by the data and then\nthe arithmetic operations may be carried out;\notherwise rounding errors can build up. For\nexample, the reciprocal of 9.58, calculated (after\nrounding off) to the same number of significant\nfigures (three) is 0.104, but the reciprocal of\n0.104 calculated to three significant figures is\n9.62.  However, if we had written 1/9.58 = 0.1044\nand then taken the reciprocal to three significant\nfigures, we would have retrieved the original\nvalue of 9.58.\n\nThis example justifies the idea to retain one\nmore extra digit (than the number of digits in\nthe least precise measurement) in intermediate\nsteps of the complex multi-step calculations in\norder to avoid additional errors in the process\nof rounding off the numbers.\n\n2.8  DIMENSIONS OF PHYSICAL QUANTITIES\n\nThe nature of a physical quantity is described\nby its dimensions. All the physical quantities\nrepresented by derived units can be expressed\nin terms of some combination of seven\nfundamental or base quantities. We shall call\nthese base quantities as the seven dimensions\nof the physical world, which are denoted with\n\nsquare brackets [ ]. Thus, length has the\ndimension [L], mass [M], time [T], electric current\n[A], thermodynamic temperature [K], luminous\nintensity [cd], and amount of substance [mol].\nThe dimensions of a physical quantity are the\npowers (or exponents) to which the base\nquantities are raised to represent that\nquantity. Note that using the square brackets\n[  ] round a quantity means that we are dealing\nwith ‘the dimensions of’ the quantity.\n\nIn mechanics, all the physical quantities can\nbe written in terms of the dimensions [L], [M]\nand [T]. For example, the volume occupied by\nan object is expressed as the product of length,\nbreadth and height, or three lengths. Hence the\ndimensions of volume are [L] × [L] × [L] = [L]3 = [L3].\nAs the volume is independent of mass and time,\nit is said to possess zero dimension in mass [M°],\nzero dimension in time [T°] and three\ndimensions in length.\n\nSimilarly, force, as the product of mass and\nacceleration, can be expressed as\nForce   = mass × acceleration\n\n= mass × (length)/(time)2\n\nThe dimensions of force are [M] [L]/[T]2 =\n[M L T–2]. Thus, the force has one dimension in\nmass, one dimension in length, and –2\ndimensions in time. The dimensions in all other\nbase quantities are zero.\n\nNote that in this type of representation, the\nmagnitudes are not considered. It is the quality\nof the type of the physical quantity that enters.\nThus, a change in velocity, initial velocity,\naverage velocity, final velocity, and speed are\nall equivalent in this context. Since all these\nquantities can be expressed as length/time,\ntheir dimensions are [L]/[T] or [L T–1].\n\n2.9 DIMENSIONAL FORMULAE AND\nDIMENSIONAL EQUATIONS\n\nThe expression which shows how and which of\nthe base quantities represent the dimensions\nof a physical quantity is called the dimensional\nformula of the given physical quantity. For\nexample, the dimensional formula of the volume\nis [M° L3 T°],  and  that of speed or velocity is\n[M° L T-1]. Similarly, [M° L T–2] is the dimensional\nformula of acceleration and [M L–3 T°] that of\nmass density.\n\nAn equation obtained by equating a physical\nquantity with its dimensional formula is called\nthe dimensional equation of the physical\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS32\n\nquantity.  Thus, the dimensional equations are\nthe equations, which represent the dimensions\nof a physical quantity in terms of the base\nquantities. For example, the dimensional\nequations of volume [V ],  speed [v], force [F ] and\nmass density [ρ] may be expressed as\n\n[V] = [M0 L3 T0]\n[v] = [M0 L T–1]\n[F] = [M L T–2]\n[ρ] = [M L–3 T0]\nThe dimensional equation can be obtained\n\nfrom the equation representing the relations\nbetween the physical quantities. The\ndimensional formulae of a large number and\nwide variety of physical quantities, derived from\nthe equations representing the relationships\namong other physical quantities and expressed\nin terms of base quantities are given in\nAppendix 9 for your guidance and ready\nreference.\n\n2.10 DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS AND ITS\nAPPLICATIONS\n\nThe recognition of concepts of dimensions, which\nguide the description of physical behaviour is\nof basic importance as only those physical\nquantities can be added or subtracted which\nhave the same dimensions.  A thorough\nunderstanding of dimensional analysis helps us\nin deducing certain relations among different\nphysical quantities and checking the derivation,\naccuracy and dimensional consistency or\nhomogeneity of various mathematical\nexpressions.  When magnitudes of two or more\nphysical quantities are multiplied, their units\nshould be treated in the same manner as\nordinary algebraic symbols. We can cancel\nidentical units in the numerator and\ndenominator.  The same is true for dimensions\nof a physical quantity.  Similarly, physical\nquantities represented by symbols on both sides\nof a mathematical equation must have the same\ndimensions.\n\n2.10.1 Checking the Dimensional\nConsistency of Equations\n\nThe magnitudes of physical quantities may be\nadded together or subtracted from one another\nonly if they have the same dimensions.  In other\nwords, we can add or subtract similar physical\nquantities. Thus, velocity cannot be added to\nforce, or an electric current cannot be subtracted\n\nfrom the thermodynamic temperature. This\nsimple principle called the principle of\nhomogeneity of dimensions in an equation is\nextremely useful in checking the correctness of\nan equation.  If the dimensions of all the terms\nare not same, the equation is wrong.  Hence, if\nwe derive an expression for the length (or\ndistance) of an object, regardless of the symbols\nappearing in the original mathematical relation,\nwhen all the individual dimensions are\nsimplified, the remaining dimension must be\nthat of length.  Similarly, if we derive an equation\nof speed, the dimensions on both the sides of\nequation, when simplified, must be of length/\ntime, or [L T–1].\n\nDimensions are customarily used as a\npreliminary test of the consistency of an\nequation, when there is some doubt about the\ncorrectness of the equation. However, the\ndimensional consistency does not guarantee\ncorrect equations. It is uncertain to the extent\nof dimensionless quantities or functions. The\narguments of special functions, such as the\ntrigonometric, logarithmic and exponential\nfunctions must be dimensionless. A pure\nnumber, ratio of similar physical quantities,\nsuch as angle as the ratio (length/length),\nrefractive index as the ratio (speed of light in\nvacuum/speed of light in medium) etc., has no\ndimensions.\n\nNow we can test the dimensional consistency\nor homogeneity of the equation\n\n( ) 21/2  0 0x x v  t a t= + +\nfor the distance x travelled by a particle or body\nin time t which starts from the position x\n\n0\n with\n\nan initial velocity v\n0\n at time t = 0 and has uniform\n\nacceleration a along the direction of motion.\nThe dimensions of each term may be written as\n\n                 [x] = [L]\n               [x\n\n0\n ] = [L]\n\n             [v\n0\n t] = [L T–1]  [T]\n\n                     = [L]\n       [(1/2) a t2] = [L T–2] [T2]\n                     = [L]\nAs each term on the right hand side of this\nequation has the same dimension, namely that\nof length, which is same as the dimension of\nleft hand side of the equation, hence this\nequation is a dimensionally correct equation.\n\nIt may be noted that a test of consistency of\ndimensions tells us no more and no less than a\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nUNITS AND MEASUREMENT 33\n\n\uf074\n\n\uf074\n\n\uf074\n\ntest of consistency of units, but has the\nadvantage that we need not commit ourselves\nto a particular choice of units, and we need not\nworry about conversions among multiples and\nsub-multiples of the units.  It may be borne in\nmind that if an equation fails this consistency\ntest, it is proved wrong, but if it passes, it is\nnot proved right.  Thus, a dimensionally correct\nequation need not be actually an exact\n(correct) equation, but a dimensionally wrong\n(incorrect) or inconsistent equation must be\nwrong.\n\nExample 2.15  Let us consider an equation\n\n      \n1\n\n2\nm v m g h\n\n2 =\n\nwhere m is the mass of the body, v its\nvelocity, g  is the acceleration due to\ngravity and h is the height.  Check\nwhether this equation is dimensionally\ncorrect.\n\nAnswer  The dimensions of LHS are\n             [M]  [L T–1 ]2 = [M] [ L2 T–2]\n\n         = [M L2 T–2]\n\nThe dimensions of RHS are\n           [M][L T–2]  [L] = [M][L2 T–2]\n\n         = [M L2 T–2]\n\nThe dimensions of LHS and RHS are the same and\nhence the equation is dimensionally correct. \uf074\n\nExample 2.16   The SI unit of energy is\nJ =  kg m2 s–2; that of speed v is  m s–1 and\nof acceleration a is   m s–2.  Which of the\nformulae for kinetic energy (K) given below\ncan you rule out on the basis of\ndimensional arguments (m stands for the\nmass of the body) :\n(a) K = m2 v3\n\n(b) K = (1/2)mv2\n\n(c) K = ma\n(d) K = (3/16)mv2\n\n(e) K = (1/2)mv2 + ma\n\nAnswer   Every correct formula or equation must\nhave the same dimensions on both sides of the\nequation.  Also, only quantities with the same\nphysical dimensions can be added or\nsubtracted.  The dimensions of the quantity on\nthe right side are [M2 L3 T–3] for (a);  [M L2 T–2] for\n\n(b) and (d); [M L T–2] for (c).  The quantity on the\nright side of (e) has no proper dimensions since\ntwo quantities of different dimensions have been\nadded.  Since the kinetic energy K has the\ndimensions of [M L2 T–2], formulas (a), (c) and (e)\nare ruled out.  Note that dimensional arguments\ncannot tell which of the two, (b) or (d), is the\ncorrect formula.  For this, one must turn to the\nactual definition of kinetic energy (see Chapter\n6).  The correct formula for kinetic energy is given\nby (b). \uf074\n\n2.10.2 Deducing Relation among the\nPhysical Quantities\n\nThe method of dimensions can sometimes be\nused to deduce relation among the physical\nquantities. For this we should know the\ndependence of the physical quantity on other\nquantities (upto three physical quantities or\nlinearly independent variables) and consider it\nas a product type of the dependence. Let us take\nan example.\n\nExample 2.17 Consider a simple\npendulum, having a bob attached to a\nstring, that oscillates under the action of\nthe force of gravity. Suppose that the period\nof oscillation of the simple pendulum\ndepends on its length  (l), mass of the bob\n(m) and acceleration due to gravity (g).\nDerive the expression for its time period\nusing method of dimensions.\n\nAnswer  The dependence of time period T on\nthe  quantities l, g and m as a product may be\nwritten as :\n\nT = k lx gy mz\n\nwhere k is dimensionless constant and x, y\nand z are the exponents.\n\nBy considering dimensions on both sides, we\nhave\n\no o 1 1 1 –2 1[L M T ]=[L ] [L T ] [M ]x y z\n\n= Lx+y T–2y  Mz\n\nOn equating the dimensions on both sides,\nwe have\n\nx + y = 0; –2y = 1; and z = 0\n\nSo that \n1 1\n\n, – , 0\n2 2\n\nx y z= = =\n\nThen, T = k l½ g–½\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS34\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. Physics is a quantitative science, based on measurement of physical quantities.  Certain\nphysical quantities have been chosen as fundamental or base quantities (such as length,\nmass, time, electric current, thermodynamic temperature, amount of substance, and\nluminous intensity).\n\n2. Each base quantity is defined in terms of a certain basic, arbitrarily chosen but properly\nstandardised reference standard called unit (such as metre, kilogram, second, ampere,\nkelvin, mole and candela).  The units for the fundamental or base quantities are called\nfundamental or base units.\n\n3. Other physical quantities, derived from the base quantities, can be expressed as a\ncombination of the base units and are called derived units.  A complete set of units,\nboth fundamental and derived, is called a system of units.\n\n4. The International System of Units (SI) based on seven base units is at present\ninternationally accepted unit system and is widely used throughout the world.\n\n5. The SI units are used in all physical measurements, for both the base quantities and\nthe derived quantities obtained from them.  Certain derived units are expressed by\nmeans of SI units with special names (such as joule, newton, watt, etc).\n\n6. The SI units have well defined and internationally accepted unit symbols (such as m for\nmetre, kg for kilogram, s for second, A for ampere, N for newton etc.).\n\n7. Physical measurements are usually expressed for small and large quantities in scientific\nnotation, with powers of 10.  Scientific notation and the prefixes are used to simplify\nmeasurement notation and numerical computation, giving indication to the precision\nof the numbers.\n\n8. Certain general rules and guidelines must be followed for using notations for physical\nquantities and standard symbols for SI units, some other units and SI prefixes for\nexpressing properly the physical quantities and measurements.\n\n9. In computing any physical quantity, the units for derived quantities involved in the\nrelationship(s) are treated as though they were algebraic quantities till the desired\nunits are obtained.\n\n10. Direct and indirect methods can be used for the measurement of physical quantities.\nIn measured quantities, while expressing the result, the accuracy and precision of\nmeasuring instruments along with errors in measurements should be taken into account.\n\n11. In measured and computed quantities proper significant figures only should be retained.\nRules for determining the number of significant figures, carrying out arithmetic\noperations with them, and ‘rounding off ‘ the uncertain digits must be followed.\n\n12. The dimensions of base quantities and combination of these dimensions describe the\nnature of physical quantities. Dimensional analysis can be used to check the dimensional\nconsistency of equations, deducing relations among the physical quantities, etc. A\ndimensionally consistent equation need not be actually an exact (correct) equation,\nbut a dimensionally wrong or inconsistent equation must be wrong.\n\nor, T = \nl\n\nk\ng\n\nNote that value of constant k can not be obtained\nby the method of dimensions. Here it does not\nmatter if some number multiplies the right side\nof this formula, because that does not affect its\ndimensions.\n\nActually, k = 2π so that T = 2\nl\n\ng\nπ \uf074\n\nDimensional analysis is very useful in deducing\nrelations among the interdependent physical\nquantities. However, dimensionless constants\ncannot be obtained by this method. The method\nof dimensions can only test the dimensional\nvalidity, but not  the exact relationship between\nphysical quantities in any equation. It does not\ndistinguish between the physical quantities\nhaving same dimensions.\n\nA number of exercises at the end of this\nchapter will help you develop skill in\ndimensional analysis.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nUNITS AND MEASUREMENT 35\n\nEXERCISES\n\nNote : In stating numerical answers, take care of significant figures.\n2.1 Fill in the blanks\n\n(a) The volume of a cube of side 1 cm is equal to .....m3\n\n(b) The surface area of a solid cylinder of radius 2.0 cm and height 10.0 cm is equal to\n      ...(mm)2\n\n(c)  A vehicle moving with a speed of 18 km h–1 covers....m in 1 s\n(d) The relative density of lead is 11.3.

Why\nis a set of 100 measurements of the diameter expected to yield a more reliable\nestimate than a set of 5 measurements only ?\n\n2.9 The photograph of a house occupies an area of 1.75 cm2 on a 35 mm slide.  The slide\nis projected on to a screen, and the area of the house on the screen is 1.55 m2.  What\nis the linear magnification of the projector-screen arrangement.\n\n2.10 State the number of significant figures in the following :\n(a)  0.007 m2\n\n(b)  2.64 × 1024 kg\n(c)  0.2370 g cm–3\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS36\n\n(d)  6.320 J\n(e)  6.032 N m–2\n\n(f)   0.0006032 m2\n\n2.11 The length, breadth and thickness of a rectangular sheet of metal are 4.234 m, 1.005 m,\nand 2.01 cm respectively. Give the area and volume of the sheet to correct significant\nfigures.\n\n2.12 The mass of a box measured by a grocer’s balance is 2.30 kg. Two gold pieces of\nmasses 20.15 g  and 20.17 g are added to the box.  What is (a) the total mass of the\nbox, (b) the difference in the masses of the pieces to correct significant figures ?\n\n2.13 A physical quantity P is related to four observables a, b, c and d as follows :\n\n( )= 3 2P a b / c d\nThe percentage errors of measurement in a, b, c and d are 1%, 3%, 4% and 2%,\nrespectively. What is the percentage error in the quantity P ?  If the value of P calculated\nusing the above relation turns out to be 3.763, to what value should you round off\nthe result ?\n\n2.14 A book with many printing errors contains four different formulas for the displacement\ny of a particle undergoing a certain periodic motion :\n(a) y = a sin 2π t/T\n(b) y = a sin vt\n(c) y = (a/T) sin t/a\n\n(d) y a t T t T= ( )2  (sin 2 / +  cos 2 / )π π\n(a = maximum displacement of the particle, v = speed of the particle.  T = time-period\nof motion). Rule out the wrong formulas on dimensional grounds.\n\n2.15 A famous relation in physics relates ‘moving mass’ m to the ‘rest mass’ m\no\n of a\n\nparticle in terms of its speed v and the speed of light, c.  (This relation first arose as\na consequence of special relativity due to Albert Einstein). A boy recalls the relation\nalmost correctly but forgets where to put the constant c.  He writes :\n\n( )\nm\n\nm\n\n1 v\n\n0=\n−\n\n2 1/2 .\n\nGuess where to put the missing c.\n\n2.16 The unit of length convenient on the atomic scale is known as an angstrom and is\ndenoted by Å: 1 Å = 10–10 m. The size of a hydrogen atom is about 0.5 Å. What is the\ntotal  atomic volume in m3 of a mole of hydrogen atoms ?\n\n2.17 One mole of an ideal gas at standard temperature and pressure occupies 22.4 L\n(molar volume). What is the ratio of molar volume to the atomic volume of a mole of\nhydrogen ?   (Take the size of  hydrogen molecule to be about 1 Å). Why is this ratio\nso large ?\n\n2.18 Explain this common observation clearly : If you look out of the window of a fast\nmoving train, the nearby trees, houses etc. seem to move rapidly in a direction opposite\nto the train’s motion, but the distant objects (hill tops, the Moon, the stars etc.)\nseem to be stationary. (In fact, since you  are aware that you are moving, these\ndistant objects seem to move with you).\n\n2.19 The principle of ‘parallax’ in section 2.3.1 is used in the determination of distances\nof very distant stars. The baseline AB is the line joining the Earth’s two locations six\nmonths apart in its orbit around the Sun.  That is, the baseline is about the diameter\nof the Earth’s orbit  ≈  3 ×  1011m. However, even the nearest stars are so distant that\nwith such a long baseline, they show parallax only of the order of 1” (second) of arc\nor so. A parsec is a convenient unit of length on the astronomical scale.  It is the\ndistance of an object that will show a parallax of 1” (second of arc) from opposite\nends of a baseline equal to the distance from the Earth to the Sun. How much is a\nparsec in terms of metres ?\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nUNITS AND MEASUREMENT 37\n\n2.20 The nearest star to our solar system is 4.29 light years away. How much is this\ndistance  in terms of parsecs?  How much parallax would this star (named Alpha\nCentauri) show when viewed  from two locations of the Earth six months apart in its\norbit around the Sun ?\n\n2.21 Precise measurements of physical quantities are a need of science.  For example, to\nascertain the speed of an aircraft, one must have an accurate method to find its\npositions at closely separated instants of time. This was the actual motivation behind\nthe discovery of radar in World War II. Think of different examples in modern science\nwhere precise measurements of length, time, mass etc. are needed. Also, wherever\nyou can, give a quantitative idea of the precision needed.\n\n2.22 Just as precise measurements are necessary in science, it is equally important to be\nable to make rough estimates of quantities using rudimentary ideas and common\nobservations. Think of ways by which you can estimate the following (where an\nestimate is difficult to obtain, try to get an upper bound on the quantity) :\n(a) the total mass of rain-bearing clouds over India during the Monsoon\n(b) the mass of an elephant\n(c) the wind speed during a storm\n(d) the number  of strands of hair on  your head\n(e) the number of air molecules in your classroom.\n\n2.23 The Sun is a hot plasma (ionized matter) with its inner core at a temperature exceeding\n107 K, and its outer surface at a temperature of about 6000 K. At these high\ntemperatures, no substance remains in a solid or liquid phase. In what range do you\nexpect the mass density of the Sun to be, in the range of densities of solids and\nliquids or gases ?  Check if your guess is correct from the following data : mass of the\nSun = 2.0 × 1030 kg, radius of the Sun = 7.0 ×  108 m.\n\n2.24 When the planet Jupiter is at a distance of 824.7 million kilometers from the Earth,\nits  angular diameter is measured to be 35.72" of arc. Calculate the diameter of\nJupiter.\n\nAdditional Exercises\n\n2.25 A man walking briskly in rain with speed v must slant his umbrella forward making\nan angle θ with the vertical. A student derives the following relation between θ  and\nv :  tan θ  = v and checks that the relation has a correct limit: as v → 0, θ → 0, as\nexpected. (We are assuming there is no strong wind and that the rain falls vertically\nfor a stationary man). Do you think this relation can be correct ? If not, guess the\ncorrect relation.\n\n2.26 It is claimed that two cesium clocks, if allowed to run for 100 years, free from any\ndisturbance, may differ by only about 0.02 s. What does this imply for the accuracy\nof the standard cesium clock in measuring a time-interval of 1 s ?\n\n2.27 Estimate the average mass density of a sodium atom assuming its size to be about\n2.5 Å. (Use the known values of Avogadro’s number and the atomic mass of sodium).\nCompare it with the mass density of sodium in its crystalline phase : 970 kg m–3. Are\nthe two densities of the same order of magnitude ? If so, why ?\n\n2.28 The unit of length convenient on the nuclear scale is a fermi : 1 f = 10–15 m. Nuclear\nsizes obey roughly the following empirical relation :\n\nr = r\n0\n A1/3\n\nwhere r is the radius of the nucleus, A its mass number, and r\no\n is a constant equal to\n\nabout, 1.2 f. Show that the rule implies that nuclear mass density is nearly constant\nfor different nuclei. Estimate the mass density of sodium nucleus. Compare it with\nthe average mass density of a sodium atom obtained in Exercise. 2.27.\n\n2.29 A LASER is a source of very intense, monochromatic, and unidirectional beam of\nlight. These properties of a laser light can be exploited to measure long distances.\nThe distance of the Moon from the Earth has been already determined very precisely\nusing a laser as a source of light.  A laser light beamed at the Moon takes 2.56 s to\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS38\n\nreturn after reflection at the Moon’s surface.  How much is the radius of the lunar\norbit around the Earth ?\n\n2.30 A SONAR (sound navigation and ranging) uses ultrasonic waves to detect and locate\nobjects under water. In a submarine equipped with a  SONAR, the time delay between\ngeneration of a probe wave and the reception of its echo after reflection from an\nenemy submarine is found to be 77.0 s.  What is the distance of the enemy submarine?\n(Speed of sound in water = 1450 m s–1).\n\n2.31 The farthest objects in our Universe discovered by modern astronomers are so distant\nthat light emitted by them takes billions of years to reach the Earth.  These objects\n(known as quasars) have many puzzling features, which have not yet been satisfactorily\nexplained. What is the distance in km of a quasar from which light takes 3.0 billion\nyears to reach us ?\n\n2.32 It is a well known fact that during a total solar eclipse the disk of the moon almost\ncompletely covers the disk of the Sun.  From this fact and from the information you\ncan gather from examples 2.3 and 2.4, determine the approximate diameter of the\nmoon.\n\n2.33 A great physicist of this century (P.A.M. Dirac) loved playing with numerical values of\nFundamental constants of nature. This led him to an interesting observation.  Dirac\nfound that from the basic constants of atomic physics (c, e, mass of electron, mass of\nproton) and the gravitational constant G, he could arrive at a number with the\ndimension of time. Further, it was a very large number, its magnitude being close to\nthe present estimate on the age of the universe (~15 billion years). From the table of\nfundamental constants in this book, try to see if you too can construct this number\n(or any other interesting number you can think of ). If its coincidence with the age of\nthe universe were significant, what would this imply for the constancy of fundamental\nconstants?\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n\n')('status', 200)
