We walk,\n\nrun and ride a bicycle.  Even when we are sleeping, air moves\n\ninto and out of our lungs and blood flows in arteries and\n\nveins.  We see leaves falling from trees and water flowing\n\ndown a dam.  Automobiles and planes carry people from one\n\nplace to the other. The earth rotates once every twenty-four\n\nhours and revolves round the sun once in a year. The sun\n\nitself is in motion in the Milky Way, which is again moving\n\nwithin its local group of galaxies.\n\nMotion is change in position of an object with time. How\n\ndoes the position change with time ? In this chapter, we shall\n\nlearn how to describe motion. For this, we develop the\n\nconcepts of velocity and acceleration. We shall confine\n\nourselves to the study of motion of objects along a straight\n\nline, also known as rectilinear motion. For the case of\n\nrectilinear motion with uniform acceleration, a set of simple\n\nequations can be obtained. Finally, to understand the relative\n\nnature of motion, we introduce the concept of relative velocity.\n\nIn our discussions, we shall treat the objects in motion as\n\npoint objects. This approximation is valid so far as the size\n\nof the object is much smaller than the distance it moves in a\n\nreasonable duration of time.  In a good number of situations\n\nin real-life, the size of objects can be neglected and they can\n\nbe considered as point-like objects without much error.\n\nIn Kinematics, we study ways to describe motion without\n\ngoing into the causes of motion. What causes motion\n\ndescribed in this chapter and the next chapter forms the\n\nsubject matter of Chapter 5.\n\n3.2  POSITION, PATH LENGTH AND DISPLACEMENT\n\nEarlier you learnt that motion is change in position of an\n\nobject with time. In order to specify position, we need to use\n\na reference point and a set of axes. It is convenient to choose\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS40\n\nwith the path of the car’s motion and origin of\nthe axis as the point from where the car started\nmoving, i.e. the car was at x = 0 at t = 0 (Fig. 3.1).\nLet P, Q and R represent the positions of the car\nat different instants of time.  Consider two cases\nof motion.  In the first case, the car moves from\nO to P.  Then the distance moved by the car is\nOP = +360 m. This distance is called the path\nlength  traversed by the car.   In the second\ncase, the car moves from O to P and then moves\nback from P to Q.   During this course of motion,\nthe path length traversed is OP + PQ = + 360 m\n+ (+120 m) = + 480 m.  Path length is a scalar\nquantity — a quantity that has a magnitude\nonly and no direction (see Chapter 4).\n\nDisplacement\n\nIt is useful to define another quantity\ndisplacement  as  the  change  in position. Let\nx\n\n1\n and x\n\n2\n be the positions of an object at time t\n\n1\n\nand t\n2\n. Then its displacement, denoted by ∆x, in\n\ntime ∆t = (t\n2 \n\n- t\n1\n), is given by the difference\n\nbetween the final and initial positions :\n                       ∆x = x\n\n2 \n– x\n\n1\n\n(We use the Greek letter delta (∆) to denote a\nchange in a quantity.)\n\nIf   x\n2\n > x\n\n1\n, ∆x is positive; and if x\n\n2 \n< x\n\n1\n,\n \n∆x is\n\nnegative.\nDisplacement has both magnitude and\n\ndirection. Such quantities are represented by\nvectors. You will read about vectors in the next\nchapter. Presently, we are dealing with motion\nalong a straight line (also called rectilinear\nmotion) only. In one-dimensional motion, there\nare only two directions (backward and forward,\nupward and downward) in which an object can\nmove, and these two directions can easily be\nspecified by + and – signs. For example,\ndisplacement of the car in moving from O to P is :\n\n∆x = x\n2\n – x\n\n1\n = (+360 m) – 0 m = +360 m\n\nThe displacement has a magnitude of 360 m and\n\nis directed in the positive x direction as indicated\nby the + sign. Similarly, the displacement of the\n\ncar from P to Q is 240 m – 360 m = – 120 m. The\n\nFig. 3.1  x-axis, origin and positions of a car at different times.\n\na rectangular coordinate system consisting of\n\nthree mutually perpenducular axes, labelled  X-,\n\nY-, and Z- axes. The point of intersection of these\n\nthree axes is called origin (O) and serves as the\n\nreference point. The coordinates (x, y. z) of an\n\nobject describe the position of the object with\n\nrespect to this coordinate system. To measure\n\ntime, we position a clock in this system. This\n\ncoordinate system along with a clock constitutes\n\na frame of reference.\n\nIf one or more coordinates of an object change\n\nwith time, we say that the object is in motion.\n\nOtherwise, the object is said to be at rest with\n\nrespect to this frame of reference.\n\nThe choice of a set of axes in a frame of\n\nreference depends upon the situation. For\n\nexample, for describing motion in one dimension,\n\nwe need only one axis. To describe motion in\n\ntwo/three dimensions, we need a set of two/\n\nthree axes.\n\nDescription of an event depends on the frame\n\nof reference chosen for the description. For\n\nexample, when you say that a car is moving on\n\na road, you are describing the car with respect\n\nto a frame of reference attached to you or to the\n\nground. But with respect to a frame of reference\nattached with a person sitting in the car, the\n\ncar is at rest.\n\nTo describe motion along a straight line, we\n\ncan choose an axis, say X-axis, so that it\n\ncoincides with the path of the object. We then\nmeasure the position of the object with reference\nto a conveniently chosen origin, say O, as shown\nin Fig. 3.1. Positions to the right of O are taken\nas positive and to the left of O, as negative.\nFollowing this convention, the position\ncoordinates of point P and Q in Fig. 3.1 are +360\nm and +240 m. Similarly, the position coordinate\nof point R is –120 m.\n\nPath length\n\nConsider the motion of a car along a straight\nline.  We choose the x-axis such that it coincides\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMOTION IN A STRAIGHT LINE 41\n\nnegative sign indicates the direction of\ndisplacement. Thus, it is not necessary to use\nvector notation for discussing motion of objects\nin one-dimension.\n\nThe magnitude of displacement may or may\nnot be equal to the path length traversed by\nan object.  For example, for motion of the car\nfrom O to P, the path length is  +360 m and the\ndisplacement is +360 m. In this case, the\nmagnitude of displacement (360 m) is equal to\nthe path length (360 m). But consider the motion\nof the car from O to P and back to Q. In this\ncase, the path length = (+360 m) + (+120 m) = +\n480 m. However, the displacement = (+240 m) –\n(0 m) =  + 240 m.  Thus, the magnitude of\ndisplacement (240 m) is not equal to the path\nlength (480 m).\n\nThe magnitude of the displacement for a\ncourse of motion may be zero but the\ncorresponding path length is not zero.  For\nexample, if the car starts from O, goes to P and\n\nthen returns to O, the final position coincides\n\nwith the initial position and the displacement\n\nis zero. However, the path length of this journey\n\nis OP + PO = 360 m +  360 m = 720 m.\n\nMotion of an object can be represented by a\n\nposition-time graph as you have already learnt\n\nabout it. Such a graph is a powerful tool to\n\nrepresent and analyse different aspects of\n\nmotion of an object.  For motion along a straight\n\nline, say X-axis, only x-coordinate varies with\n\ntime and we have an x-t graph. Let us first\n\nconsider the simple case in which an object is\n\nstationary, e.g. a car standing still at x = 40 m.\n\nThe position-time graph is a straight line parallel\n\nto the time axis, as shown in Fig. 3.2(a).\n\nIf an object moving along the straight line\n\ncovers equal distances in equal intervals of\n\ntime, it is said to be in uniform motion along a\n\nstraight line. Fig. 3.2(b) shows the position-time\n\ngraph of such a motion.\n\nFig. 3.2  Position-time graph of (a) stationary object, and (b) an object in uniform motion.\n\nFig. 3.3  Position-time graph of a car.\nt (s) \uf09e\n\n\uf023\nx\n\n(m)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS42\n\nNow, let us consider the motion of a car that\nstarts from rest at time t = 0 s from the origin O\nand picks up speed till t = 10 s and thereafter\nmoves with uniform speed till t = 18 s. Then the\nbrakes are applied and the car stops at\nt = 20 s and x = 296 m. The position-time graph\nfor this case is shown in Fig. 3.3. We shall refer\nto this graph in our discussion in the following\nsections.\n\n3.3  AVERAGE VELOCITY AND AVERAGE\nSPEED\n\nWhen an object is in motion, its position\nchanges with time.  But how fast is the position\nchanging with time and in what direction?  To\ndescribe this, we define the quantity average\nvelocity. Average velocity is defined as the\nchange in position or displacement (∆x) divided\nby the time intervals (∆t), in which the\ndisplacement occurs :\n\n     v\nx x\n\nt t\n\nx\n\nt\n\n2 1\n\n2 1\n\n=\n−\n\n−\n=\n\n∆\n\n∆\n(3.1)\n\nwhere x\n2\n  and x\n\n1\n are the positions of the object\n\nat time t\n2\nand  t\n\n1\n, respectively. Here the bar over\n\nthe symbol for velocity is a standard notation\nused to indicate an average quantity.  The SI\nunit for velocity is m/s or m s–1, although km h–1\n\nis used in many everyday applications.\nLike displacement, average velocity is also a\n\nvector quantity. But as explained earlier, for\nmotion in a straight line, the directional aspect\nof the vector can be taken care of by + and –\nsigns and we do not have to use the vector\nnotation for velocity in this chapter.\n\nFig. 3.4 The average velocity is the slope of line P\n1\nP\n\n2\n.\n\nConsider the motion of the car in Fig. 3.3. The\nportion of the x-t graph between t = 0 s and t = 8\ns is blown up and shown in Fig. 3.4.  As seen\nfrom the plot, the average velocity of the car\nbetween time t = 5 s and t = 7 s is :\n\n(((( ))))\n(((( ))))\n\n1–\n\n12\n\n12\nsm  8.7\n\ns 57\n\nm 010427\n====\n\n−−−−\n\n−−−−\n====\n\n−−−−\n\n−−−−\n====\n\n..\n\ntt\n\nxx\nv\n\nGeometrically, this is the slope of the straight\nline P\n\n1\nP\n\n2\n connecting the initial position \n\n1\nP  to\n\nthe final position P\n2\n   \nas\n\n   \nshown in Fig. 3.4.\n\nThe average velocity can be positive or negative\ndepending upon the sign of the displacement. It\nis zero if the displacement is zero. Fig. 3.5 shows\nthe x-t graphs for an object, moving with positive\nvelocity (Fig. 3.5a), moving with negative velocity\n(Fig. 3.5b)  and at rest (Fig. 3.5c).\n\nAverage velocity as defined above involves\nonly the displacement of the object. We have seen\nearlier that the magnitude of displacement may\nbe different from the actual path length. To\ndescribe the rate of motion over the actual path,\nwe introduce another quantity called average\nspeed.\n\nAverage speed  is defined as the total path\nlength travelled divided by the total time\ninterval during which the motion has taken\nplace :\n\nAverage speed\nTotal path length\n\nTotal time interval \n=   (3.2)\n\nAverage speed has obviously the same unit\n(m s–1) as that of velocity.  But it does not tell us\nin what direction an object is moving.  Thus, it\nis always positive (in contrast to the average\nvelocity which can be positive or negative). If the\nmotion of an object is along a straight line and\nin the same direction, the magnitude of\ndisplacement is equal to the total path length.\nIn that case, the magnitude of average velocity\n\nFig. 3.5 Position-time graph for an object (a) moving\nwith positive velocity, (b) moving with\n\nnegative velocity, and (c) at rest.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMOTION IN A STRAIGHT LINE 43\n\n\uf074\n\nis equal to the average speed.  This is not always\nthe case, as you will see in the following example.\n\nExample 3.1 A car is moving along a\nstraight line, say OP in Fig. 3.1.  It moves\nfrom O to P in 18 s and returns from P to Q\nin 6.0 s.  What are the average velocity\nand average speed of the car in going (a)\nfrom O to P ? and (b) from O to P and back\nto Q ?\n\nAnswer    (a)\n\n Average velocity\nDisplacement\n\nTime interval \n=\n\n   1\n+ 360 m \n\n20 m s\n18 s\n\nv\n−= = +\n\n     Average speed  \nPath length\n\nTime interval\n=\n\n                \n1360 m \n\n= 20 m s\n18 s\n\n−=\n\nThus, in this case the average speed is equal to\nthe magnitude of the average velocity.\n(b) In this case,\n\n( )\n240 m\n\n18 6.0  s\n\nDisplacement \nAverage velocity =\n\nTime interval \n\n+\n=\n\n+\n\n                            -1=+10 ms\n\nOP + PQPath length\nAverage speed = =\n\nTime interval t∆\n\n \n( ) -1360+120  m\n\n= = 20 m s\n24 s\n\nThus, in this case the average speed is not equal\nto the magnitude of the average velocity. This\nhappens because the motion here involves\nchange in direction so that the path length is\ngreater than the magnitude of displacement.\nThis shows that speed is, in general, greater\nthan the magnitude of the velocity. \uf074\n\nIf the car in Example 3.1 moves from O to P\n\nand comes back to O in the same time interval,\naverage speed is 20 m/s but the average velocity\nis zero !\n\n3.4  INSTANTANEOUS VELOCITY AND SPEED\n\nThe average velocity tells us how fast an object\nhas been moving over a given time interval but\ndoes not tell us how fast it moves at different\ninstants of time during that interval.  For this,\nwe define instantaneous velocity or simply\nvelocity v at an instant t.\n\nThe velocity at an instant is defined as the\nlimit of the average velocity as the time interval\n∆t becomes infinitesimally small. In other words,\n\nv lim\nx\n\nt\n=\n\nt  0∆ \n\n∆\n\n∆→\n(3.3a)\n\n  =\nd\n\nd\n\nx\n\nt\n\n(3.3b)\n\nwhere the symbol \nlim\n\nt 0∆ →\n stands for the operation\n\nof taking limit as  ∆t\uf0670 of the quantity on its\nright. In the language of calculus, the quantity\non the right hand side of Eq. (3.3a) is the\ndifferential coefficient of x with respect to t and\n\nis denoted by \n \n\nd\n\nd\n\nx\n\nt\n (see Appendix 3.1).  It is the\n\nrate of change of position with respect to time,\n\nat that instant.\n\nWe can use Eq. (3.3a) for obtaining the value\nof velocity at an instant either graphically or\nnumerically. Suppose that we want to obtain\ngraphically the value of velocity at time  t = 4 s\n(point P) for the motion of the car represented\nin Fig. 3.3. The figure has been redrawn in\nFig. 3.6 choosing different scales to facilitate the\n\nFig. 3.6 Determining velocity from position-time\ngraph.  Velocity at t = 4 s is the slope of the\ntangent to the graph at that instant.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS44\n\ncalculation. Let us take ∆t = 2 s centred at\nt = 4 s. Then, by the definition of the average\nvelocity, the slope of line P1P2  ( Fig. 3.6) gives\nthe value of average velocity over the interval\n3 s to 5 s.  Now, we decrease the value of ∆t from\n2 s to 1 s.  Then line P1P2 becomes Q1Q2   and its\nslope gives the value of the average velocity over\nthe interval 3.5 s to 4.5 s. In the limit ∆t → 0,\nthe line P\n\n1\nP\n\n2\n becomes tangent to the position-\n\ntime curve at the point P and the velocity at t =\n4 s is given by the slope of the tangent at that\npoint. It is difficult to show this process\ngraphically. But if we use numerical method\nto obtain the value of the velocity, the\nmeaning of the limiting process becomes\nclear. For the graph shown in\nFig. 3.6, x = 0.08 t3.  Table 3.1 gives the value of\n∆x/∆t calculated for ∆t equal to 2.0 s, 1.0 s, 0.5\ns, 0.1 s and 0.01 s centred at t = 4.0 s. The\nsecond and third columns give the value of t\n\n1\n=\n\nt\nt\n\n2\n−\n\n\uf001\n\n\uf002\n\uf003\n\n\uf004\n\n\uf005\n\uf006\n\n∆\n and t t\n\nt\n\n2\n2 = +\n\n\uf001\n\n\uf002\n\uf003\n\n\uf004\n\n\uf005\n\uf006\n\n∆\n and the fourth and\n\nthe fifth columns give the corresponding values\n\nof x, i.e. x (t\n1\n) = 0.08 t\n\n1\n\n3\n and x (t\n\n2\n) = 0.08 t\n\n2\n\n3. The\nsixth column lists the difference ∆x = x (t\n\n2\n) – x\n\n(t\n1\n) and the last column gives the ratio of ∆x and\n\n∆t, i.e. the average velocity corresponding to the\nvalue of ∆t listed in the first column.\n\nWe see from Table 3.1 that as we decrease\nthe value of ∆t from 2.0 s to 0.010 s, the value of\nthe average velocity approaches the limiting\nvalue 3.84 m s–1 which is the value of velocity at\n\nt = 4.0 s, i.e. the value of  \nd\n\nd\n\nx\n\nt\n at t = 4.0 s. In this\n\nmanner, we can calculate velocity at each\n\ninstant for motion of the car shown in Fig. 3.3.\nFor this case, the variation of velocity with time\nis found to be as shown in Fig. 3.7.\n\nFig. 3.7 Velocity–time graph corresponding to motion\nshown in Fig. 3.3.\n\nThe graphical method for the determination\nof the instantaneous velocity is always not a\nconvenient method.  For this, we must carefully\nplot the position–time graph and calculate the\nvalue of average velocity as ∆t becomes smaller\nand smaller.  It is easier to calculate the value\nof velocity at different instants if we have data\nof positions at different instants or exact\nexpression for the position as a function of time.\nThen, we calculate ∆x/∆t from the data for\ndecreasing the value of ∆t and find the limiting\nvalue as we have done in Table 3.1 or use\ndifferential calculus for the given expression and\n\ncalculate \nd\n\nd\n\nx\n\nt\n at different instants as done in\n\nthe following example.\n\nTable 3.1  Limiting value of \n∆\n\n∆\n\nx\n\nt\n at t = 4 s\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMOTION IN A STRAIGHT LINE 45\n\n\uf074\n\nExample 3.2    The position of an object\nmoving along x-axis is given by   x = a + bt2\n\nwhere  a = 8.5 m, b = 2.5 m s–2 and t is\nmeasured in seconds. What is its velocity at\n\nt = 0 s and t = 2.0 s. What is the average\nvelocity between t = 2.0 s and t = 4.0 s ?\n\nAnswer  In notation of differential calculus, the\nvelocity is\n\n( )v x\nt t\n\na bt 2b t =  \n2\n\n= = + =\nd\n\nd\n\nd\n\nd\n5.0 t m s\n\n-1\n \n\nAt   t = 0 s,      v = 0 m s–1   and at   t = 2.0 s,\nv = 10 m s-1 .\n\n( ) ( )4.0 2.0\n4.0 2.0\n\nx x\nAverage velocity\n\n−\n=\n\n−\n\n        \n16 – – 4\n\n6.0\n2.0\n\na b a b\nb\n\n+\n= = ×\n\n        -16.0 2.5 =15 m s= ×           \uf020\uf020\uf074\nFrom Fig. 3.7, we note that during the period\n\nt =10 s to 18 s the velocity is constant. Between\nperiod t =18 s to t = 20 s, it is uniformly\ndecreasing  and  during  the  period t = 0 s to     t\n= 10 s, it is increasing. Note that for uniform\nmotion, velocity is the same as the average\nvelocity at all instants.\n\nInstantaneous speed or simply speed is the\nmagnitude of velocity. For example, a velocity of\n+ 24.0 m s–1 and a velocity of – 24.0 m s–1 — both\nhave an associated speed of 24.0 m s-1.  It should\nbe noted that though average speed over a finite\ninterval of time is greater or equal to the\nmagnitude of the average velocity,\ninstantaneous speed at an instant is equal to\nthe magnitude of the instantaneous velocity at\nthat instant. Why so ?\n\n3.5  ACCELERATION\n\nThe velocity of an object, in general, changes\nduring its course of motion. How to describe this\nchange? Should it be described as the rate of\nchange in velocity with distance or with time ?\nThis was a problem even in Galileo’s time. It was\nfirst thought that this change could be described\nby the rate of change of velocity with distance.\nBut, through his studies of motion of freely falling\nobjects and motion of objects on an inclined\nplane, Galileo concluded that the rate of change\nof velocity with time is a constant of motion for\nall objects in free fall. On the other hand, the\nchange in velocity with distance is not constant\n– it decreases with the increasing distance of fall.\n\nThis led to the concept of acceleration as the rate\nof change of velocity with time.\n\n The average acceleration a  over a time\n\ninterval is defined as the change of velocity\ndivided by the time interval :\n\n2 1\n\n2 1\n\n–\n\n–\n\nv v v\na\n\nt t t\n\n∆\n= =\n\n∆ (3.4)\n\nwhere v2 and v1 are the instantaneous velocities\nor simply velocities at time  t2\n\n \nand t1\n\n \n. It is the\n\naverage change of velocity per unit time. The SI\nunit of acceleration is m s–2 .\n\nOn a plot of velocity versus time, the average\nacceleration is the slope of the straight line\nconnecting the points corresponding to (v2, t2)\nand (v1, t1). The average acceleration\nfor     velocity-time graph shown in Fig. 3.7 for\ndifferent time intervals 0 s - 10 s, 10 s – 18 s,\nand 18 s – 20 s are :\n\n0 s - 10 s\n( )\n\n( )\n\n–1\n–224 – 0 m s\n\n2.4 m s\n10 – 0 s\n\na = =\n\n10 s - 18 s   \n( )\n\n( )\n\n–1\n–224 – 24 m s\n\n0 m s\n18 – 10 s\n\na = =\n\n18 s - 20 s    \n( )\n\n( )\n\n–1\n–20 – 24 m s\n\n– 12 m s\n20 – 18 s\n\na = =\n\nFig. 3.8 Acceleration as a function of time for motion\n\nrepresented in Fig. 3.3.\n\nInstantaneous acceleration is defined in the same\nway as the instantaneous velocity :\n\nd\n\ndt 0\n\nv v\na lim\n\nt t∆ →\n\n∆\n= =\n\n∆\n(3.5)\n\nThe acceleration at an instant is the slope of\nthe tangent to the v–t curve at that instant.  For\nthe v–t curve shown in  Fig.  3.7, we can obtain\nacceleration at every instant of time. The\nresulting a – t curve is shown in Fig. 3.8. We see\n\n a\n (\nm\n\n s\n–\n2\n)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS46\n\nthat the acceleration is nonuniform over the\nperiod  0 s to 10 s. It is zero between 10 s and\n18 s and is constant with value –12 m s–2\n\nbetween 18 s and 20 s. When the acceleration\nis uniform, obviously, it equals the average\nacceleration over that period.\n\nSince velocity is a quantity having both\nmagnitude and direction, a change in velocity\nmay involve either or both of these factors.\nAcceleration, therefore, may result from a\nchange in speed (magnitude), a change in\ndirection or changes in both.  Like velocity,\nacceleration can also be positive, negative or\nzero.  Position-time graphs for motion with\npositive, negative and zero acceleration are\nshown in Figs. 3.9 (a), (b) and (c), respectively.\nNote that the graph curves upward for positive\nacceleration; downward for negative\nacceleration and it is a straight line for zero\nacceleration. As an exercise, identify in Fig. 3.3,\nthe regions of the curve that correspond to these\nthree cases.\n\nAlthough acceleration can vary with time,\nour study in this chapter will be restricted to\nmotion with constant acceleration. In this case,\nthe average acceleration equals the constant\nvalue of acceleration during the interval. If the\nvelocity of an object is v\n\no\n at t = 0 and v at time t,\n\nwe have\n\n          or\n0\n\n0\n0\n\nv v\na   ,  v v a t\n\nt\n\n−\n= = +\n\n−\n(3.6)\n\nFig. 3.9 Position-time graph for motion with\n(a) positive acceleration; (b) negative\n\nacceleration, and (c) zero acceleration.\n\nLet us see how velocity-time graph looks like\nfor some simple cases. Fig. 3.10 shows     velocity-\ntime graph for motion with constant acceleration\nfor the following cases :\n\n(a) An object is moving in a positive direction\nwith a positive acceleration, for example\nthe motion of the car in  Fig. 3.3 between\nt = 0 s and t = 10 s.\n\n(b) An object is moving in positive direction\nwith a negative acceleration, for example,\nmotion of the car in Fig 3.3 between\nt = 18 s and 20 s.\n\n(c) An object is moving in negative direction\nwith a negative acceleration, for example\nthe motion of a car moving from O in Fig.\n3.1 in negative x-direction with\nincreasing speed.\n\n(d) An object is moving in positive direction\ntill time t1, and then turns back with the\nsame negative acceleration, for example\nthe motion of a car from point O to point\nQ in Fig. 3.1 till time t1 with decreasing\nspeed and turning back and moving with\nthe same negative acceleration.\n\nAn interesting feature of a velocity-time graph\nfor any moving object is that the area under the\ncurve represents the displacement over a\ngiven time interval. A general proof of this\n\nFig. 3.10 Velocity–time graph for motions with\n\nconstant acceleration.

Between times 0 to t\n\n1\n, its moves in\n\npositive x - direction and between t\n1\n and\n\nt\n2\n it moves in the opposite direction.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMOTION IN A STRAIGHT LINE 47\n\nstatement requires use of calculus. We can,\nhowever, see that it is true for the simple case of\nan object moving with constant velocity u. Its\nvelocity-time graph is as shown in Fig. 3.11.\n\nFig. 3.11 Area under v–t curve equals displacement\n\nof the object over a given time interval.\n\nThe v-t curve is\n \na straight line parallel to the\n\ntime axis and the area under it between t = 0\nand t = T\n\n  \nis the area of the rectangle of height u\n\nand base T. Therefore, area = u × T = uT which\nis the displacement in this time interval.  How\ncome in this case an area is equal to a distance?\nThink!  Note the dimensions of quantities on\nthe two coordinate axes, and you will arrive at\nthe answer.\n\nNote that the x-t, v-t, and a-t graphs shown\nin several figures in this chapter have sharp\nkinks at some points implying that the\nfunctions are not differentiable at these\npoints. In any realistic situation, the\nfunctions will be differentiable at all points\nand the graphs will be smooth.\n\nWhat this means physically is that\nacceleration and velocity cannot change\nvalues abruptly at an instant. Changes are\nalways continuous.\n\n3.6 KINEMATIC EQUATIONS FOR\nUNIFORMLY ACCELERATED MOTION\n\nFor uniformly accelerated motion, we can derive\nsome simple equations that relate displacement\n(x), time taken (t), initial velocity (v\n\n0\n), final\n\nvelocity (v) and acceleration (a). Equation (3.6)\nalready obtained gives a relation between final\nand initial velocities v and  v\n\n0  \nof an object moving\n\nwith uniform acceleration\n \na :\n\n             v = v\n0\n + at (3.6)\n\nThis relation is graphically represented in Fig. 3.12.\nThe area under this curve is :\nArea between instants 0 and t = Area of triangle\nABC + Area of rectangle OACD\n\n \n( )– 0 0\n\n1\nv v t + v t\n\n2\n=\n\nFig. 3.12 Area  under v-t curve for an object with\nuniform acceleration.\n\nAs explained in the previous section, the area\nunder v-t curve represents the displacement.\nTherefore, the displacement x of the object is :\n\n( )\n1\n\n–\n2\n\n0 0x v v t + v t= (3.7)\n\nBut v v a t\n0\n\n− =\n\nTherefore,\n2\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\nx a t + v t=\n\nor,\n2\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\nx v t at= + (3.8)\n\nEquation (3.7) can also be written as\n\n0\n\n2\n\nv + v\nx t v t= = (3.9a)\n\nwhere,\n\n0\n\n2\n\nv v\nv\n\n+\n=   (constant acceleration only)\n\n(3.9b)\n\nEquations (3.9a) and  (3.9b) mean that the object\nhas undergone displacement x with an average\nvelocity equal to the arithmetic average of the\ninitial and final velocities.\nFrom Eq. (3.6), t = (v – v\n\n0\n)/a. Substituting this in\n\nEq. (3.9a), we get\n\n       x v t\nv v v v\n\na\n\nv v\n\na\n= =\n\n+\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n−\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n=\n−0 0\n\n2\n0\n2\n\n2 2\n\n     2 2\n0 2v v ax= + (3.10)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS48\n\n\uf074\n\nThis equation can also be obtained by\nsubstituting the value of t from Eq. (3.6) into\nEq. (3.8). Thus, we have obtained three\nimportant equations :\n\n0v v at= +\n\n         \n2\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\nx v t at= +\n\n2 2\n0 2v v ax= + (3.11a)\n\nconnecting five quantities v\n0\n,  v, a, t and x.  These\n\nare kinematic equations of rectilinear motion\nfor constant acceleration.\n\nThe set of Eq. (3.11a) were obtained by\nassuming that at t = 0, the position of the\nparticle, x is 0.  We can obtain a more general\nequation if we take  the  position coordinate at t\n= 0 as non-zero, say x\n\n0\n.  Then Eqs. (3.11a) are\n\nmodified (replacing x by x – x\n0\n ) to :\n\n0v v at= +\n\n2\n0 0\n\n1\n\n2\nx x v t at= + + (3.11b)\n\n2 2\n0 02 ( )v v a x x= + − (3.11c)\n\nExample 3.3 Obtain equations of motion\nfor constant acceleration using method of\ncalculus.\n\nAnswer  By definition\n\nd\n\nd\n\nv\na\n\nt\n=\n\n dv = a dt\nIntegrating both sides\n\nd dv a t\nv\n\nv t\n\n0 0\n∫ ∫=\n\n= ∫a t\nt\n\nd\n0\n\n         (a is constant)\n\n0–v v at=\n\n       0v v at= +\n\nFurther,        \nd\n\nd\n\nx\nv\n\nt\n=\n\n      dx = v dt\nIntegrating both sides\n\ndx\nx\n\nx\n\n0\n∫ = ∫ v t\n\nt\n\nd\n0\n\n= +( )∫ v at t\nt\n\n0\n0\n\nd\n\n2\n0 0\n\n1\n–\n\n2\nx x v t a t= +\n\n      x   = \n2\n\n0 0\n\n1\n\n2\nx v t a t+ +\n\nWe can write\n\nd d d d\n\nd d d d\n\nv v x v\na v\n\nt x t x\n= = =\n\nor, v dv = a dx\nIntegrating both sides,\n\nv v a x\nv\n\nv\n\nx\n\nx\n\nd d\n0 0\n\n∫ ∫=\n\n( )\n2 2\n\n0\n0\n\n–\n–\n\n2\n\nv v\na x x=\n\n( )2 20 02 –v v a x x= +\nThe advantage of this method is that it can be\n\nused for motion with non-uniform acceleration\n\nalso.\n\nNow, we shall use these equations to some\nimportant cases. \uf074\n\nExample 3.4 A ball is thrown vertically\nupwards with a velocity of 20 m s–1 from\nthe top of a multistorey building. The\nheight of the point from where the ball is\nthrown is 25.0 m from the ground. (a) How\nhigh will the ball rise ?  and (b) how long\nwill it be before the ball hits the ground?\nTake g = 10 m s–2.\n\nAnswer  (a) Let us take the y-axis in the\n\nvertically upward direction with zero at the\n\nground, as shown in Fig. 3.13.\n\nNow  v\no\n \n= + 20 m s–1,\n\n   a  =  – g = –10 m s–2,\n\n   v  =  0 m s–1\n\nIf the ball rises to height y from the point of\n\nlaunch, then using the equation\n\n( )0   2 20v v 2 a y – y= +\nwe get\n\n0 = (20)2 + 2(–10)(y – y\n0\n)\n\nSolving,  we get, (y – y\n0\n) = 20 m.\n\n(b) We can solve this part of the problem in two\n\nways.  Note carefully the methods used.\n\n\uf074\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMOTION IN A STRAIGHT LINE 49\n\n\uf074\n\nFig. 3.13\n\nFIRST METHOD :  In the first method, we split\nthe path in two parts : the upward motion  (A to\nB) and the downward motion (B to C) and\ncalculate the corresponding time taken t\n\n1\n and\n\nt\n2\n.  Since the velocity  at B is zero, we have :\n                  v  =  v\n\no\n +  at\n\n0 = 20  – 10t\n1\n\nOr,            t\n1 \n= 2 s\n\nThis is the time in going from A to B.  From B, or\nthe point of  the maximum height, the ball falls\nfreely under the acceleration due to gravity.  The\nball is moving in negative y direction.  We use\nequation\n\n          \n2\n\n0 0\n\n1\n\n2\ny y v t at= + +\n\nWe have, y\n0\n = 45 m, y = 0, v\n\n0\n = 0, a = – g  = –10 m s–2\n\n   0  =  45 + (½) (–10) t\n2\n\n2\n\nSolving, we get t\n2\n = 3 s\n\nTherefore, the total time taken by the ball before\nit hits the ground = t\n\n1 \n+\n\n   \nt\n2\n  = \n\n \n2\n\n  \ns\n\n \n+ 3 s = 5 s.\n\nSECOND METHOD : The total time taken can\nalso be calculated by noting the coordinates of\ninitial and final positions of the ball with respect\nto the origin chosen and using equation\n\n2\n0 0\n\n1\n\n2\ny y v t at= + +\n\nNow y\n0  \n\n=\n  \n25 m        y = 0 m\n\nv\no\n = 20 m s-1, a  = –10m s–2,  t  =  ?\n\n0 = 25  +20 t  + (½)  (-10) t2\n\nOr, 5t2 – 20t  – 25  =  0\n\nSolving this quadratic equation for t, we get\n\nt = 5s\n\nNote that the second method is better since we\ndo not have to worry about the path of the motion\nas the motion is under constant acceleration.\n\n\uf020\uf020\uf074\n\nExample 3.5  Free-fall : Discuss the\nmotion of an object under free  fall.  Neglect\nair resistance.\n\nAnswer  An object released near the surface of\nthe Earth is accelerated downward under the\ninfluence of the force of gravity. The magnitude\nof acceleration due to gravity is represented by\ng.  If air resistance is neglected, the object is\nsaid to be in free fall. If the height through\nwhich the object falls is small compared to the\nearth’s radius, g can be taken to be constant,\nequal to   9.8 m s–2. Free fall is thus a case of\nmotion with uniform acceleration.\n\nWe assume that the motion is in y-direction,\nmore correctly in –y-direction because we\nchoose upward direction as positive. Since the\nacceleration due to gravity is always downward,\nit is in the negative direction and we have\n\na = – g  = – 9.8 m s–2\n\nThe object is released from rest at y = 0. Therefore,\nv\n\n0\n = 0 and the equations of motion become:\n\nv =  0 – g t       = –9.8 t      m s–1\n\ny =  0 – ½  g t2   = –4.9 t 2    m\nv2 = 0 – 2 g y     = –19.6 y   m2 s–2\n\nThese equations give the velocity and the\ndistance travelled as a function of time and also\nthe variation of velocity with distance. The\nvariation of acceleration, velocity, and distance,\nwith time have been plotted in Fig.  3.14(a), (b)\nand (c).\n\n(a)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS50\n\n\uf074\n\n(b)\n\n      (c)\n\nFig. 3.14 Motion of an object under free fall.\n(a)  Variation of acceleration with time.\n(b) Variation of velocity with time.\n\n(c) Variation of distance with time \uf074\n\nExample 3.6 Galileo’s law of odd\nnumbers : “The distances traversed, during\nequal intervals    of time, by a body falling\n\nfrom rest, stand to one another in the same\n\nratio as the odd numbers beginning with\n\nunity [namely, 1: 3: 5: 7…...].”  Prove it.\n\nAnswer  Let us divide the time interval of\nmotion of an object under free fall into many\nequal intervals\n\n \nτ   and find out the distances\n\ntraversed during successive intervals of\ntime. Since initial velocity is zero, we have\n\nUsing this equation, we can calculate the\n\nposition of the object after different time\n\nintervals, 0, τ, 2τ,  3τ… which are given in\nsecond column of Table 3.2. If we take\n\n(–1/\n \n2) gτ2 as y\n\n0 \n— the position coordinate after\n\nfirst time interval τ, then third column gives\nthe positions in the unit of y\n\no\n. The fourth\n\ncolumn gives the distances traversed in\n\nsuccessive τs. We find that the distances are\nin the simple ratio 1: 3: 5: 7: 9: 11… as  shown\n\nin the last column. This  law was established\n\nby Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) who was the first\n\nto make quantitative studies of free fall. \uf074\n\nExample 3.7  Stopping distance of\nvehicles : When brakes are applied to a\nmoving vehicle, the distance it travels before\nstopping is called stopping distance.  It is\nan important factor for road safety and\ndepends on the initial velocity (v\n\n0\n) and the\n\nbraking capacity, or deceleration, –a that\nis caused by the braking. Derive an\nexpression for stopping distance of a vehicle\nin terms of v\n\no\n and\n\n \na.\n\nAnswer  Let the distance travelled by the vehicle\nbefore it stops be d\n\ns\n. Then, using equation of\n\nmotion  v2 = v\no\n2 + 2 ax, and noting that  v = 0, we\n\nhave the stopping distance\n\nd\nv\n\na\ns =\n\n– 0\n2\n\n2\n\nThus, the stopping distance is proportional to\nthe square of the initial velocity. Doubling the\n\n\uf074\n\nTable 3.2\n\ny gt= −\n1\n\n2\n2\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMOTION IN A STRAIGHT LINE 51\n\n\uf074\n\ninitial velocity increases the stopping distance\nby a factor of 4 (for the same deceleration).\n\nFor  the car of a particular make, the braking\ndistance was found to be 10 m, 20 m, 34 m and\n50 m corresponding to velocities of 11, 15, 20\nand 25 m/s which are nearly consistent with\nthe above formula.\n\nStopping distance is an important factor\nconsidered in setting speed limits, for example,\nin school zones. \uf074\n\nExample 3.8  Reaction time :  When a\nsituation demands our immediate\naction, it takes some time before we\nreally respond. Reaction time is the\ntime a person takes to observe, think\nand act.  For example, if a person is\ndriving and suddenly a boy appears on\nthe road, then the time elapsed before\nhe slams the brakes of the car is the\nreaction time. Reaction time depends\non complexity of the situation and on\nan individual.\n\nYou can measure your reaction time\nby a simple experiment. Take a ruler\nand ask your friend to drop it vertically\nthrough the gap between your thumb\nand forefinger (Fig. 3.15). After you\ncatch it, find the distance d travelled\nby the ruler. In a particular case, d was\nfound to be 21.0 cm. Estimate reaction\ntime.\n\nOr,\n\nGiven d = 21.0 cm and g = 9.8 m s–2  the reaction\ntime is\n\n\uf074\n\n3.7  RELATIVE VELOCITY\n\nYou must be familiar with the experience of\ntravelling in a train and being overtaken by\nanother train moving in the same direction as\nyou are. While that train must be travelling faster\nthan you to be able to pass you, it does seem\nslower to you than it would be to someone\nstanding on the ground and watching both the\ntrains. In case both the trains have the same\nvelocity with respect to the ground, then to you\nthe other train would seem to be not moving at\nall.  To understand such observations, we now\nintroduce the concept of relative velocity.\n\nConsider two objects A and B moving\nuniformly with average velocities v\n\nA\n and v\n\nB\n in\n\none dimension, say along x-axis. (Unless\notherwise specified, the velocities mentioned in\nthis chapter are measured with reference to the\nground). If x\n\nA\n (0) and x\n\nB\n (0) are positions of objects\n\nA and B, respectively at time t = 0, their positions\nx\n\nA\n (t) and x\n\nB\n (t) at time t are given by:\n\nx\nA\n (t )  =  x\n\nA\n (0)  +  v\n\nA\n  t     (3.12a)\n\nx\nB\n (t)   =  x\n\nB\n (0)  +  v\n\nB\n t               (3.12b)\n\nThen, the displacement from object A to object\nB is given by\n\nx\nBA\n\n(t)  =  x\nB\n (t)  –  x\n\nA\n (t)\n\n= [ x\nB\n (0) – x\n\nA\n (0) ] + (v\n\nB\n – v\n\nA\n) t.      (3.13)\n\nEquation (3.13) is easily interpreted. It tells us\nthat as seen from object A, object B has a\nvelocity v\n\nB \n– v\n\nA\n because the displacement from\n\nA to B changes steadily by the amount v\nB \n– v\n\nA\n in\n\neach unit of time. We say that the velocity of\nobject B relative to object A is v\n\nB\n – v\n\nA\n :\n\nv\nBA\n\n  =  v\nB \n – v\n\nA\n(3.14a)\n\nSimilarly, velocity of object A relative to object B\nis:\n\nv\nAB\n\n  =  v\nA\n – v\n\nB\n(3.14b)\n\nFig. 3.15   Measuring the reaction time.\n\nAnswer  The ruler drops under free fall.\nTherefore, v\n\no\n = 0, and a = – g = –9.8 m s–2. The\n\ndistance travelled d and the reaction time t\nr\n are\n\nrelated by\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS52\n\nThis shows: v\nBA \n\n= – v\nAB\n\n(3.14c)\n\nNow we consider some special cases :\n\n(a) If v\nB\n = v\n\nA\n, v\n\nB \n–\n\n \nv\n\nA\n  = 0.  Then, from Eq. (3.13), x\n\nB\n\n(t) – x\nA\n (t) = x\n\nB\n (0) – x\n\nA\n (0).  Therefore, the two\n\nobjects stay at a constant distance (x\nB\n (0) – x\n\nA\n\n(0)) apart, and their position–time graphs are\n\nstraight lines parallel to each other as shown\n\nin Fig. 3.16. The relative velocity v\nAB\n\n or v\nBA\n\n is\n\nzero in this case.\n\n(b) If v\nA\n > v\n\nB\n, v\n\nB\n – v\n\nA\n is negative.  One graph is\n\nsteeper than the other and they meet at a\n\ncommon point.  For example, suppose v\nA \n = 20 m s-1\n\nand x\nA\n (0) = 10 m; and v\n\nB\n = 10 m s-1, x\n\nB\n (0) = 40\n\nm; then the time at which they meet is t = 3 s\n\n(Fig. 3.17). At this instant they are both at a\n\nposition x\nA\n (t) = x\n\nB\n (t) = 70 m. Thus, object A\n\novertakes object B at this time. In this case,v\nBA\n\n= 10 m s–1 – 20 m s–1 = – 10 m s–1=– v\nAB\n\n.\n\n(c) Suppose v\nA\n and v\n\nB\n are of opposite signs. For\n\nexample, if in the above example object A is\n\nmoving with 20 m s–1 starting at  x\nA\n(0) = 10 m\n\nand object B is moving with – 10 m s–1 starting\n\nat x\nB\n (0) = 40 m,  the two objects meet at t = 1 s\n\n(Fig. 3.18).

The position of the\nobject can be specified with reference to a conveniently chosen origin.  For motion in\na straight line, position to the right of the origin is taken as positive and to the left as\nnegative.\n\n2. Path length is defined as the total length of the path traversed by an object.\n3. Displacement is the change in position :  ∆x  =  x\n\n2 \n– x\n\n1\n.\n   \nPath length is greater or equal to\n\nthe magnitude of the displacement between the same points.\n4. An object is said to be in uniform motion in a straight line if its displacement is  equal\n\nin equal intervals of time.  Otherwise, the motion is said to be non-uniform.\n5. Average velocity is the displacement divided by the time interval in which the\n\ndisplacement occurs :\n\nv\nx\n\nt\n=\n\n∆\n\n∆\n\nOn an x-t graph, the average velocity over a time interval is the slope of the line\n\nconnecting the initial and final positions corresponding to that interval.\n\n6. Average Speed is the ratio of total path length traversed and the corresponding time\ninterval.\n\nThe average speed of an object is greater or equal to the magnitude of the average\nvelocity over a given time interval.\n\n7. Instantaneous velocity or simply velocity is defined as the limit of the average velocity as\nthe time interval ∆t becomes infinitesimally small :\n\nd\n\ndt 0 t 0\n\nx x\nv lim v lim\n\nt t∆ → ∆ →\n\n∆\n= = =\n\n∆\n\nThe velocity at a particular instant is equal to the slope of the tangent drawn on\nposition-time graph at that instant.\n\n8. Average acceleration is the change in velocity divided by the time interval during which\nthe change occurs :\n\nv\na\n\nt\n\n∆\n=\n\n∆\n\n9. Instantaneous acceleration is defined as the limit of the average acceleration as the time\ninterval ∆t goes to zero :\n\nd\n\ndt 0 t 0\n\nv v\na lim a lim\n\nt t∆ → ∆ →\n\n∆\n= = =\n\n∆\n\nThe acceleration of an object at a particular time is the slope of the velocity-time\ngraph at that instant of time.  For uniform motion, acceleration is zero and the x-t\ngraph is a straight line inclined to the time axis and the v-t graph is a straight line\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS54\n\nparallel to the time axis. For motion with uniform acceleration, x-t graph is a parabola\nwhile the v-t graph is a straight line inclined to the time axis.\n\n10. The area under the velocity-time curve between times t\n1 \nand t\n\n2\n is equal to the displacement\n\nof the object during that interval of time.\n\n11. For objects in uniformly accelerated rectilinear motion, the five quantities, displacement\nx, time taken t, initial velocity v\n\n0\n, final velocity v and acceleration a are related by a set\n\nof simple equations called kinematic equations of motion :\n\n        v = v\n0\n +  at\n\n       x v t\n1\n\n2\nat\n\n0\n\n2\n= +\n\n        v v 2ax\n2\n\n0\n\n2\n= +\n\nif the position of the object at time t = 0 is 0.  If the particle starts at x = x\n0\n , x in above\n\nequations is replaced by (x – x\n0\n).\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMOTION IN A STRAIGHT LINE 55\n\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n\n1. The path length traversed by an object between two points is, in general, not the same\nas the magnitude of displacement.  The displacement depends only on the end points;\nthe path length (as the name implies) depends on the actual path.  In one dimension,\nthe two quantities are equal only if the object does not change its direction during the\ncourse of motion.  In all other cases, the path length is greater than the magnitude of\ndisplacement.\n\n2. In view of point 1 above, the average speed of an object is greater than or equal to the\nmagnitude of the average velocity over a given time interval. The two are equal only if\nthe path length is equal to the magnitude of displacement.\n\n3. The origin and the positive direction of an axis are a matter of choice. You should first\nspecify this choice before you assign signs to quantities like displacement, velocity\nand acceleration.\n\n4. If a particle is speeding up, acceleration is in the direction of velocity; if its speed is\ndecreasing, acceleration is in the direction opposite to that of the velocity.  This\nstatement is independent of the choice of the origin and the axis.\n\n5. The sign of acceleration does not tell us whether the particle’s speed is increasing or\ndecreasing.  The sign of acceleration (as mentioned in point 3) depends on the choice\nof the positive direction of the axis.  For example, if the vertically upward direction is\nchosen to be the positive direction of the axis, the acceleration due to gravity is\nnegative.  If a particle is falling under gravity, this acceleration, though negative,\nresults in increase in speed.  For a particle thrown upward, the same negative\nacceleration (of gravity) results in decrease in speed.\n\n6. The zero velocity of a particle at any instant does not necessarily imply zero acceleration\nat that instant.  A particle may be momentarily at rest and yet have non-zero\nacceleration.  For example, a particle thrown up has zero velocity at its uppermost\npoint but the acceleration at that instant continues to be the acceleration due to\ngravity.\n\n7. In the kinematic equations of motion [Eq. (3.11)], the various quantities are algebraic,\ni.e. they may be positive or negative.  The equations are applicable in all situations\n(for one dimensional motion with constant acceleration) provided the values of different\nquantities are substituted in the equations with proper signs.\n\n8. The definitions of instantaneous velocity and acceleration (Eqs. (3.3) and (3.5)) are\nexact and are always correct while the kinematic equations (Eq. (3.11)) are true only\nfor motion in which the magnitude and the direction of acceleration are constant\nduring the course of motion.\n\nEXERCISES\n\n3.1 In which of the following examples of motion, can the body be considered\napproximately a point object:\n(a) a railway carriage moving without jerks between two stations.\n(b) a monkey sitting on top of a man cycling smoothly on a circular track.\n(c) a spinning cricket ball that turns sharply on hitting the ground.\n(d) a tumbling beaker that has slipped off the edge of a table.\n\n3.2 The position-time (x-t) graphs for two children A and B returning from their school\nO to their homes P and Q respectively are shown in Fig. 3.19.

Though you will learn in detail in mathematics about derivatives, we shall introduce\nthis concept in brief in this Appendix so as to facilitate its use in describing physical quantities\ninvolved in motion.\n\nSuppose we have a quantity y whose value depends upon a single variable x, and is expressed\nby an equation defining y as some specific function of x.  This is represented as:\n\n y = f (x) (1)\n\nThis relationship can be visualised by drawing a graph of function y = f (x) regarding y and x as\nCartesian coordinates, as shown in Fig. 3.30 (a).\n\n                             (a)      (b)\nFig.  3.30\n\nConsider the point P on the curve y = f (x) whose coordinates are (x, y) and another point Q\nwhere coordinates are (x + ∆x, y + ∆y).  The slope of the line joining P and Q is given by:\n\n( )\nx\n\nyyy\n\nx\n\ny\ntan\n\n∆\n−∆+\n\n=\n∆\n∆\n\n=θ (2)\n\nSuppose now that the point Q moves along the curve towards P.  In this process, ∆y and ∆x\n\ndecrease and approach zero; though their ratio \n∆\n\n∆\n\ny\n\nx\n  will not necessarily vanish.  What happens\n\nto the line PQ as ∆y→ 0, ∆x→ 0. You can see that this line becomes a tangent to the curve at\npoint P as shown in Fig. 3.30(b).  This means that tan θ  approaches the slope of  the tangent at\nP, denoted by m:\n\n                                \nx 0 0\n\n( )\nlim lim\n\nx\n\ny y y y\nm\n\nx x∆ → ∆ →\n\n∆ + ∆ −\n= =\n\n∆ ∆\n(3)\n\nThe limit of the ratio ∆y/∆x as  ∆x approaches zero is called the derivative of y with respect to x\nand is written as dy/dx. It represents the slope of the tangent line to the curve y = f (x) at the\npoint (x, y).\n\nSince y = f (x) and y + ∆y = f (x + ∆x), we can write the definition of the derivative as:\n\n                    \uf007\n\uf008\n\uf009\n\n\uf00a\n\uf00b\n\uf00c\n\n∆\n∆+\n\n=\n∆\n∆\n\n==\n→∆→∆ x\n\nxfxxf \n \n\nx\n\ny\n \n\n)(\n\nx\n\n)(–)(\nlimlim\n\ndx\n\nd\n\ndx\n\ndy\n\n00x\n\nxf\n\nGiven below are some elementary formulae for derivatives of functions.

The formulae for areas of simple geometrical figures are\nalso known to you.  For example, the area of a rectangle is length times breadth and that of a\ntriangle is half of the product of base and height.  But how to deal with the problem of determination\nof area of an irregular figure?  The mathematical notion of integral is necessary in connection with\nsuch problems.\n\nLet us take a concrete example.  Suppose a variable force f (x) acts on a particle in its motion\nalong x - axis from x = a to x = b.  The problem is to determine the work done (W) by the force on the\nparticle during the motion.  This problem is discussed in detail in Chapter 6.\n\nFigure 3.31 shows the variation of  F(x)  with x.  If the force were constant, work  would  be  simply\nthe area F (b-a) as shown in Fig. 3.31(i).  But in the general case, force is varying .\n\nFig. 3.31\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMOTION IN A STRAIGHT LINE 63\n\nTo calculate the area under this curve  [Fig. 3.31  (ii)], let us employ the following trick.  Divide the\ninterval on x-axis from a to b into a large number (N) of small intervals: x0(=a) to x1, x1 to x2 ; x2 to x3,\n................................ xN-1 to xN (=b). The area under the curve is thus divided into N strips.  Each strip\nis approximately a rectangle, since the variation of  F(x) over a strip is negligible.

You may\nwonder whether we should put F(xi-1) or the mean of F(xi)  and  F(xi-1) in the above expression.  If we\ntake N to be very very large (N→∞ ),  it does not really matter, since then the strip will be so thin that\nthe difference between  F(xi) and F(xi-1)  is vanishingly small.
