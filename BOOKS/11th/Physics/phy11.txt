A kettle\nwith boiling water is hotter than a box containing ice. In\nphysics, we need to define the notion of heat, temperature,\netc., more carefully. In this chapter, you will learn what heat\nis and how it is measured, and study the various proceses by\nwhich heat flows from one body to another. Along the way,\nyou will find out why blacksmiths heat the iron ring before\nfitting on the rim of a wooden wheel of a horse cart and why\nthe wind at the beach often reverses direction after the sun\ngoes down. You will also learn what happens when water boils\nor freezes, and its temperature does not change during these\nprocesses even though a great deal of heat is flowing into or\nout of it.\n\n11.2  TEMPERATURE AND HEAT\n\nWe can begin studying thermal properties of matter with\ndefinitions of temperature and heat. Temperature is a relative\nmeasure, or indication of hotness or coldness. A hot utensil\nis said to have a high temperature, and ice cube to have a\nlow temperature. An object that has a higher temperature\nthan another object is said to be hotter. Note that hot and\ncold are relative terms, like tall and short. We can perceive\ntemperature by touch. However, this temperature sense is\nsomewhat unreliable and its range is too limited to be useful\nfor scientific purposes.\n\nWe know from experience that a glass of ice-cold water left\non a table on a hot summer day eventually warms up whereas\na cup of hot tea on the same table cools down. It means that\nwhen the temperature of body, ice-cold water or hot tea in\nthis case, and its surrounding medium are different, heat\ntransfer takes place between the system and the surrounding\nmedium, until the body and the surrounding medium are at\nthe same temperature. We also know that in the case of glass\ntumbler of ice-cold water, heat flows from the environment to\n\n11.1 Introduction\n\n11.2 Temperature and heat\n\n11.3 Measurement of\ntemperature\n\n11.4 Ideal-gas equation and\nabsolute temperature\n\n11.5 Thermal expansion\n\n11.6 Specific heat capacity\n\n11.7 Calorimetry\n\n11.8 Change of state\n\n11.9 Heat transfer\n11.10 Newton’s law of cooling\n\nSummary\nPoints to ponder\nExercises\nAdditional Exercises\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nthe glass tumbler, whereas in the case of hot\ntea, it flows from the cup of hot tea to the\nenvironment. So, we can say that heat is the\nform of energy transferred between two (or\nmore) systems or a system and its\nsurroundings by virtue of temperature\ndifference. The SI unit of heat energy\ntransferred is expressed in joule (J) while SI unit\nof temperature is Kelvin (K), and degree Celsius\n(oC) is a commonly used unit of temperature.\nWhen an object is heated, many changes may\ntake place. Its temperature may rise, it may\nexpand or change state. We will study the effect\nof heat on different bodies in later sections.\n\n11.3  MEASUREMENT OF TEMPERATURE\n\nA measure of temperature is obtained using a\nthermometer. Many physical properties of\nmaterials change sufficiently with temperature.\nSome such properties are used as the basis for\nconstructing thermometers. The commonly used\nproperty is variation of the volume of a liquid\nwith temperature. For example, in common\nliquid–in–glass thermometers,  mercury, alcohol\netc., are used whose volume varies linearly with\ntemperature over a wide range.\n    Thermometers are calibrated so that a\nnumerical value may be assigned to a given\ntemperature in an appropriate scale. For the\ndefinition of any standard scale, two fixed\nreference points are needed. Since all\nsubstances change dimensions with\ntemperature, an absolute reference for\nexpansion is not available. However, the\nnecessary fixed points may be correlated to the\nphysical phenomena that always occur at the\nsame temperature. The ice point and the steam\npoint of water are two convenient fixed points\nand are known as the freezing and boiling\npoints, respectively. These two points are the\ntemperatures at which pure water freezes and\nboils under standard pressure. The two familiar\ntemperature scales are the Fahrenheit\ntemperature scale and the Celsius temperature\nscale. The ice and steam point have values\n32 °F and 212 °F, respectively, on the Fahrenheit\nscale and 0 °C and 100 °C on the Celsius scale.\nOn the Fahrenheit scale, there are 180 equal\nintervals between two reference points, and on\nthe Celsius scale, there are 100.\n\nFig. 11.1 A plot of Fahrenheit temperature (tF) versus\nCelsius temperature (tc).\n\n A relationship for converting between the two\nscales may be obtained from a graph of\nFahrenheit temperature (t\n\nF\n) versus celsius\n\ntemperature (t\nC\n) in a straight line (Fig. 11.1),\n\nwhose equation is\n\nt t\nF C\n\n– 32\n180 100\n\n= (11.1)\n\n11.4 IDEAL-GAS EQUATION AND\nABSOLUTE TEMPERATURE\n\nLiquid-in-glass thermometers show different\nreadings for temperatures other than the fixed\npoints because of differing expansion properties.\nA thermometer that uses a gas, however, gives\nthe same readings regardless of which gas is\nused. Experiments show that all gases at low\ndensities exhibit same expansion behaviour. The\nvariables that describe the behaviour of a given\nquantity (mass) of gas are pressure, volume, and\ntemperature (P, V, and T )(where T = t + 273.15;\nt is the temperature in °C). When temperature\nis held constant, the pressure and volume of a\nquantity of gas are related as  PV = constant.\nThis relationship is known as Boyle’s law, after\nRobert Boyle (1627–1691), the English Chemist\nwho discovered it. When the pressure is held\nconstant, the volume of a quantity of the gas is\nrelated to the temperature as V/T = constant.\nThis relationship is known as Charles’ law,\nafter  French scientist Jacques Charles (1747–\n1823). Low-density gases obey these\nlaws, which may be combined into a single\n\nTHERMAL PROPERTIES OF MATTER 279\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n280 PHYSICS\n\nrelationship. Notice that since PV = constant\nand V/T = constant for a given quantity of gas,\nthen PV/T should also be a constant. This\nrelationship is known as ideal gas law. It can be\nwritten in a more general form that applies not\njust to a given quantity of a single gas but to any\nquantity of any low-density gas and is known as\nideal-gas equation:\n\nPV\nR\n\nT\nµ=\n\nor PV = µRT (11.2)\nwhere, µ is the number of moles in the sample\nof gas and R is called universal gas constant:\n\nR = 8.31 J mol–1 K–1\n\nIn Eq. 11.2, we have learnt that the pressure\nand volume are directly proportional to\ntemperature : PV ∝ T. This relationship allows a\ngas to be used to measure temperature in a\nconstant volume gas thermometer. Holding the\nvolume of a gas constant, it gives P ∝T. Thus,\nwith a constant-volume gas thermometer,\ntemperature is read in terms of pressure. A plot\nof pressure versus temperature gives a straight\nline in this case, as shown in Fig. 11.2.\n\nHowever, measurements on real gases deviate\nfrom the values predicted by the ideal gas law\nat low temperature. But the relationship is linear\nover a large temperature range, and it looks as\nthough the pressure might reach zero with\ndecreasing temperature if the gas continued to\nbe a gas. The absolute minimum temperature\nfor an ideal gas, therefore, inferred by\nextrapolating the straight line to the axis, as in\nFig. 11.3.  This temperature is found to be\n– 273.15 °C and is designated as absolute zero.\nAbsolute zero is the foundation of the Kelvin\ntemperature scale or absolute scale temperature\n\nnamed after the British scientist Lord Kelvin. On\nthis scale, – 273.15 °C is taken as the zero point,\nthat is 0 K (Fig. 11.4).\n\nThe size of unit in Kelvin and Celsius\ntemperature scales is the same.  So, temperature\non these scales are related by\n\nT = t\nC\n + 273.15 (11.3)\n\n11.5  THERMAL EXPANSION\n\nYou may have observed that sometimes sealed\nbottles with metallic lids are so tightly screwed\nthat one has to put the lid in hot water for some\ntime to open it. This would allow the metallic lid\nto expand, thereby loosening it to unscrew\neasily. In case of liquids, you may have observed\nthat mercury in a thermometer rises, when the\nthermometer is put in slightly warm water. If\nwe take out the thermometer from the warm\n\nFig. 11.2 Pressure versus temperature of a low\ndensity gas kept at constant volume.\n\nFig. 11.3 A plot of pressure versus temperature and\nextrapolation of lines for low density gases\n\nindicates the same absolute zero\n\ntemperature.\n\nFig. 11.4 Comparision of the Kelvin, Celsius and\nFahrenheit temperature scales.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTHERMAL PROPERTIES OF MATTER 281\n\nwater the level of mercury falls again. Similarly,\nin case of gases, a balloon partially inflated in a\ncool room may expand to full size when placed\nin warm water. On the other hand, a fully\ninflated balloon when immersed in cold water\nwould start shrinking due to contraction of the\nair inside.\n\nIt is our common experience that most\nsubstances expand on heating and contract on\ncooling. A change in the temperature of a body\ncauses change in its dimensions. The increase\nin the dimensions of a body due to the increase\nin its temperature is called thermal expansion.\nThe expansion in length is called linear\nexpansion. The expansion in area is called area\nexpansion. The expansion in volume is called\nvolume expansion (Fig. 11.5).\n\nFig. 11.5  Thermal Expansion.\n\nIf the substance is in the form of a long rod,\nthen for small change in temperature, ∆T, the\nfractional change in length, ∆l/l, is directly\nproportional to ∆T.\n\n∆\n∆\n\nl\n\nl\nT=α1 (11.4)\n\nwhere α\n1 \nis known as the coefficient of linear\n\nexpansion (or linear expansivity) and is\ncharacteristic of the material of the rod. In Table\n11.1, typical average values of the coefficient of\nlinear expansion for some material in the\ntemperature range 0 °C to 100 °C are given. From\nthis Table, compare the value of α\n\nl\n for glass and\n\ncopper. We find that copper expands about five\ntimes more than glass for the same rise in\ntemperature. Normally, metals expand more and\nhave relatively high values of α\n\nl\n.\n\nTable 11.1 Values of coef ficient of linear\n\nexpansion for some material\n\nMaterial ααααα\nl\n (10–5 K–1)\n\nAluminium 2.5\nBrass 1.8\nIron 1.2\nCopper 1.7\nSilver 1.9\nGold 1.4\nGlass (pyrex) 0.32\nLead 0.29\n\nSimilarly, we consider the fractional change\n\nin volume, \n∆V\nV\n\n, of a substance for temperature\n\nchange ∆T and define the coefficient of volume\n\nexpansion (or volume expansivity), α  V  as\n\nα  V =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f7\n\n∆\n∆\n\nV\n\nV T\n\n1\n(11.5)\n\nHere α\nV\n is also a characteristic of the\n\nsubstance but is not strictly a constant. It\ndepends in general on temperature (Fig 11.6). It\nis seen that α\n\nV\n becomes constant only at a high\n\ntemperature.\n\nFig. 11.6 Coefficient of volume expansion of copper\n\nas a function of temperature.\n\nTable 11.2 gives the values of coefficient of\nvolume expansion of some common substances\nin the temperature range 0–100 °C. You can see\nthat thermal expansion of these substances\n(solids and liquids) is rather small, with material,\n\nl\n\nl\na T\n\nl\n\n∆\n= ∆ l2\n\nA\na T\n\nA\n\n∆\n= ∆ l3\n\nV\na T\n\nV\n\n∆\n= ∆\n\n(a) Linear expansion (b) Area expansion (c) Volume expansion\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n282 PHYSICS\n\nlike pyrex glass and invar (a special iron-nickel\nalloy) having particularly low values of α\n\nV\n. From\n\nthis Table we find that the value of α\nv\n for\n\nalcohol (ethanol) is more than mercury and\nexpands more than mercury for the same rise\nin temperature.\n\nTable 11.2 Values of coefficient of volume\nexpansion for some substances\n\nMaterial ααααα\nv\n ( K–1)\n\nAluminium 7 × 10–5\n\nBrass 6 × 10–5\n\nIron 3.55 × 10–5\n\nParaffin 58.8 × 10–5\n\nGlass (ordinary) 2.5 × 10–5\n\nGlass (pyrex) 1 × 10–5\n\nHard rubber 2.4 × 10–4\n\nInvar 2 × 10–6\n\nMercury 18.2 × 10–5\n\nWater 20.7 × 10–5\n\nAlcohol (ethanol) 110 × 10–5\n\nWater exhibits an anomalous behaviour; it\ncontracts on heating between 0 °C and 4 °C.\nThe volume of a given amount of water decreases\nas it is cooled from room temperature, until its\ntemperature reaches 4 °C, [Fig. 11.7(a)]. Below\n4 °C, the volume increases, and therefore, the\ndensity decreases [Fig. 11.7(b)].\n\nThis means that water has the maximum\ndensity at 4 °C. This property has an important\nenvironmental effect: bodies of water, such as\n\nlakes and ponds, freeze at the top first. As a lake\ncools toward 4 °C, water near the surface loses\nenergy to the atmosphere, becomes denser, and\nsinks; the warmer, less dense water near the\nbottom rises. However, once the colder water on\ntop reaches temperature below 4 °C, it becomes\nless dense and remains at the surface, where it\nfreezes. If water did not have this property, lakes\nand ponds would freeze from the bottom up,\nwhich would destroy much of their animal and\nplant life.\n\nGases, at ordinary temperature, expand more\nthan solids and liquids. For liquids, the\ncoefficient of volume expansion is relatively\nindependent of the temperature. However, for\ngases it is dependent on temperature. For an\nideal gas, the coefficient of volume expansion at\nconstant pressure can be found from the ideal\ngas equation:\n\nPV = µRT\nAt constant pressure\nP∆V = µR ∆T\n\n∆ ∆V\nV\n\nT\n\nT\n=\n\ni.e., αv\nT\n\n=\n1\n\n for ideal gas (11.6)\n\nAt 0 °C, α\nv\n = 3.7 × 10–3 K–1, which is much\n\nlarger than that for solids and liquids.\nEquation (11.6) shows the temperature\ndependence of α\n\nv\n; it decreases with increasing\n\ntemperature. For a gas at room temperature and\nconstant pressure, α\n\nv\n is about 3300 × 10–6 K–1, as\n\nTemperature (°C) Temperature (°C)\n(a) (b)\n\nFig. 11.7 Thermal expansion of water.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTHERMAL PROPERTIES OF MATTER 283\n\nt\n\nt\n\nmuch as order(s) of magnitude larger than the\ncoefficient of volume expansion of typical liquids.\n\nThere is a simple relation between the\ncoefficient of volume expansion (α\n\nv\n) and\n\ncoefficient of linear expansion (α\nl\n). Imagine a\n\ncube of length, l, that expands equally in all\ndirections, when its temperature increases by\n∆T. We have\n\n∆l = α\nl\n l ∆T\n\nso, ∆V = (l+∆l)3 – l3 �  3l2 ∆l (11.7)\nIn Equation (11.7), terms in (∆l)2 and (∆l)3 have\n\nbeen neglected since ∆l is small compared to l.\nSo\n\n∆\n∆\n\n∆V\nV l\n\nl\nV T\n\nl\n= =\n\n3\n3 α (11.8)\n\nwhich gives\n\nα\nv\n = 3α\n\nl\n(11.9)\n\nWhat happens by preventing the thermal\nexpansion of a rod by fixing its ends rigidly?\nClearly, the rod acquires a compressive strain\ndue to the external forces provided by the rigid\nsupport at the ends. The corresponding stress\nset up in the rod is called thermal stress. For\nexample, consider a steel rail of length 5 m and\narea of cross-section 40 cm2 that is prevented\nfrom expanding while the temperature rises by\n10 °C. The coefficient of linear expansion of steel\nis α\n\nl(steel) \n= 1.2 × 10–5  K–1. Thus, the compressive\n\nstrain is \n∆l\nl\n\n= α\nl(steel) \n\n∆T = 1.2 × 10–5 × 10=1.2 × 10–4.\n\nYoungs modulus of steel is Y\n (steel)\n\n = 2 × 1011 N m–2.\nTherefore, the thermal stress developed is\n\n∆ ∆F\nA\n\nY\nl\n\nl\nsteel=\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f7 = 2.4 × 107 N m–2, which\n\ncorresponds to an external force of\n\n∆F = AY\nsteel\n\n \n∆l\nl\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f7  =  2.4 × 107 × 40 × 10–4 j 105N.\n\nIf two such steel rails, fixed at their outer ends,\nare in contact at their inner ends, a force of this\nmagnitude can easily bend the rails.\n\nExample 11.1 Show that the coefficient\nof area expansion, (∆A/A)/∆T, of a\nrectangular sheet of the solid is twice its\nlinear expansivity, α\n\nl\n.\n\nAnswer\n\nFig. 11.8\n\nConsider a rectangular sheet of the solid\nmaterial of length a and breadth b (Fig. 11.8 ).\nWhen the temperature increases by ∆T, a\nincreases by  ∆a = α\n\nl \na∆T and b increases by ∆b\n\n= α\nl\nb ∆T. From Fig. 11.8,  the increase in area\n∆A = ∆A\n\n1\n +∆A\n\n2\n + ∆A\n\n3\n\n∆A = a ∆b + b ∆a + (∆a)  (∆b)\n= a α\n\nl\nb ∆T + b α\n\nl\n a ∆T + (α\n\nl\n)2 ab (∆T)2\n\n= α\nl\n ab ∆T (2 + α\n\nl\n ∆T) = α\n\nl\n A ∆T (2 + α\n\nl\n ∆T)\n\nSince α\nl �\n\n 10–5 K–1, from Table 11.1, the\nproduct α\n\nl\n ∆T for fractional temperature is small\n\nin comparision with 2 and may be neglected.\nHence,\n\nt\n\nExample 11.2 A blacksmith fixes iron ring\non the rim of the wooden wheel of a horse\ncart.

Soon you will notice that bubbles\nbegin to move upward. As the temperature is\nraised the motion of water particles increases\ntill it becomes turbulent as water starts boiling.\nWhat are the factors on which the quantity of\nheat required to raise the temperature of a\nsubstance depend? In order to answer this\nquestion in the first step, heat a given quantity\nof water to raise its temperature by, say 20 °C\nand note the time taken. Again take the same\namount of water and raise its temperature by\n40 °C using the same source of heat. Note the\ntime taken by using a stopwatch. You will find\nit takes about twice the time and therefore,\ndouble the quantity of heat required raising twice\nthe temperature of same amount of water.\n\nIn the second step, now suppose you take\ndouble the amount of water and heat it, using\nthe same heating arrangement, to raise the\ntemperature by 20 °C, you will find the time\ntaken is again twice that required in the first\nstep.\n\nIn the third step, in place of water, now heat\nthe same quantity of some oil, say mustard oil,\nand raise the temperature again by 20 °C. Now\nnote the time by the same stopwatch. You will\nfind the time taken will be shorter and therefore,\nthe quantity of heat required would be less than\nthat required by the same amount of water for\nthe same rise in temperature.\n\nThe above observations show that the quantity\nof heat required to warm a given substance\ndepends on its mass, m, the change in\ntemperature, ∆T and the nature of substance.\nThe change in temperature of a substance, when\na given quantity of heat is absorbed or rejected\nby it, is characterised by a quantity called the\nheat capacity of that substance. We define heat\ncapacity, S of a substance as\n\nQ\nS\n\nT\n\n∆\n=\n\n∆\n(11.10)\n\nwhere ∆Q is the amount of heat supplied to\nthe substance to change its temperature from T\nto T + ∆T.\n\nYou have observed that if equal amount of\nheat is added to equal masses of different\nsubstances, the resulting temperature changes\nwill not be the same. It implies that every\nsubstance has a unique value for the amount of\n\nheat absorbed or given off to change the\ntemperature of unit mass of it by one unit. This\nquantity is referred to as the specific heat\ncapacity of the substance.\n\nIf ∆Q stands for the amount of heat absorbed\nor given off by a substance of mass m when it\nundergoes a temperature change ∆T, then the\nspecific heat capacity, of that substance is given\nby\n\n1S Q\ns\n\nm m T\n\n∆\n= =\n\n∆\n(11.11)\n\nThe specific heat capacity is the property of\nthe substance which determines the change in\nthe temperature of the substance (undergoing\nno phase change) when a given quantity of heat\nis absorbed (or given off) by it. It is defined as the\namount of heat per unit mass absorbed or given\noff by the substance to change its temperature\nby one unit. It depends on the nature of the\nsubstance and its temperature. The SI unit of\nspecific heat capacity is J kg–1 K–1.\n\nIf the amount of substance is specified in\nterms of moles µ, instead of mass m in kg, we\ncan define heat capacity per mole of the\nsubstance by\n\nC\nS Q\n\nT\n= =\n\nµ µ\n\n1 ∆\n∆ (11.12)\n\nwhere C is known as molar specific heat\ncapacity of the substance. Like S, C also\ndepends on the nature of the substance and its\ntemperature. The SI unit of molar specific heat\ncapacity is J mol–1 K–1.\n\nHowever, in connection with specific heat\ncapacity of gases, additional conditions may be\nneeded to define C. In this case, heat transfer\ncan be achieved by keeping either pressure or\nvolume constant. If the gas is held under\nconstant pressure during the heat transfer, then\nit is called the molar specific heat capacity at\nconstant pressure and is denoted by C\n\np\n. On\n\nthe other hand, if the volume of the gas is\nmaintained during the heat transfer, then the\ncorresponding molar specific heat capacity is\ncalled molar specific heat capacity at constant\nvolume and is denoted by C\n\nv\n. For details see\n\nChapter 12. Table 11.3 lists measured specific\nheat capacity of some substances at atmospheric\npressure and ordinary temperature while Table\n11.4 lists molar specific heat capacities of some\ngases. From Table 11.3 you can note that water\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTHERMAL PROPERTIES OF MATTER 285\n\nt\n\nhas the highest specific heat capacity compared\nto other substances. For this reason water is also\nused as a coolant in automobile radiators, as\nwell as, a heater in hot water bags. Owing to its\nhigh specific heat capacity, water warms up\nmore slowly than land during summer, and\nconsequently wind from the sea has a cooling\neffect. Now, you can tell why in desert areas,\nthe earth surface warms up quickly during the\nday and cools quickly at night.\n\nTable 11.4 Molar specific heat capacities of\n\nsome gases\n\nGas C\np\n (J mol–1K–1)  C\n\nv\n(J mol–1K–1)\n\nHe 20.8 12.5\n\nH\n2\n\n28.8 20.4\n\nN\n2\n\n29.1 20.8\n\nO\n2\n\n29.4 21.1\n\nCO\n2\n\n37.0 28.5\n\n11.7  CALORIMETRY\n\nA system is said to be isolated if no exchange or\ntransfer of heat occurs between the system and\nits surroundings. When different parts of an\nisolated system are at different temperature, a\nquantity of heat transfers from the part at higher\ntemperature to the part at lower temperature.\nThe heat lost by the part at higher temperature\nis equal to the heat gained by the part at lower\ntemperature.\n\nCalorimetry means measurement of heat.\nWhen a body at higher temperature is brought\nin contact with another body at lower\ntemperature, the heat lost by the hot body is\n\nequal to the heat gained by the colder body,\nprovided no heat is allowed to escape to the\nsurroundings. A device in which heat\nmeasurement can be done is called a\ncalorimeter. It consists of a metallic vessel and\nstirrer of the same material, like copper or\naluminium. The vessel is kept inside a wooden\njacket, which contains heat insulating material,\nlike glass wool etc. The outer jacket acts as a\nheat shield and reduces the heat loss from the\ninner vessel. There is an opening in the outer\njacket through which a mercury thermometer\ncan be inserted into the calorimeter (Fig. 11.20).\nThe following example provides a method by\nwhich the specific heat capacity of a given solid\ncan be determinated by using the principle, heat\ngained is equal to the heat lost.\n\nExample 11.3 A sphere of 0.047 kg\naluminium is placed for sufficient time in a\nvessel containing boiling water, so that the\nsphere is at 100 °C. It is then immediately\ntransfered to 0.14 kg copper calorimeter\ncontaining 0.25 kg water at 20 °C. The\ntemperature of water rises and attains a\nsteady state at 23 °C. Calculate the specific\nheat capacity of aluminium.\n\nAnswer  In solving this example, we shall use\nthe fact that at a steady  state, heat given by an\naluminium sphere will be equal to the heat\nabsorbed by the water and calorimeter.\nMass of aluminium sphere (m\n\n1\n) = 0.047 kg\n\nInitial temperature of aluminium sphere = 100 °C\nFinal temperature = 23 °C\nChange in temperature (∆T)=(100 °C -23 °C) = 77 °C\nLet specific heat capacity of aluminium be s\n\nAl\n.\n\nTable 11.3 Specific heat capacity of some substances at room temperature and atmospheric\n\npressure\n\nSubstance Specific heat capacity Substance Specific heat capacity\n (J kg–1 K–1) (J kg–1 K–1)\n\nAluminium 900.0 Ice 2060\nCarbon 506.5 Glass 840\nCopper 386.4 Iron 450\nLead 127.7 Kerosene 2118\nSilver 236.1 Edible oil 1965\nTungesten 134.4 Mercury 140\nWater 4186.0\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n286 PHYSICS\n\nThe amount of heat lost by the aluminium\nsphere =  ∆ = × × °1 0.047kg 77 CAl Alm s T s\nMass of water (m\n\n2\n) = 0.25 kg\n\nMass of calorimeter (m\n3\n) = 0.14 kg\n\nInitial temperature of water and calorimeter=20 °C\n\nFinal temperature of the mixture = 23 °C\n\nChange in temperature (∆T\n2\n) = 23 °C – 20 °C = 3 °C\n\nSpecific heat capacity of water (s\nw\n)\n\n= 4.18 × 103 J kg–1  K–1\n\nSpecific heat capacity of copper calorimeter\n\n= 0.386 × 103 J kg–1  K–1\n\nThe amount of heat gained by water and\ncalorimeter = m\n\n2\n s\n\nw\n ∆T\n\n2\n + m\n\n3\ns\n\ncu\n∆T\n\n2\n\n= (m\n2\ns\n\nw\n + m\n\n3\ns\n\ncu\n) (∆T\n\n2\n)\n\n= (0.25 kg × 4.18 × 103 J kg–1  K–1 + 0.14 kg ×\n0.386 × 103 J kg–1  K–1) (23 °C – 20 °C)\n\nIn the steady state heat lost by the aluminium\nsphere = heat gained by water + heat gained by\ncalorimeter.\nSo, 0.047 kg × s\n\nAl\n × 77 °C\n\n= (0.25 kg × 4.18 × 103 J kg–1  K–1+ 0.14 kg ×\n0.386 × 103 J kg–1  K–1)(3 °C)\n\ns\nAl\n = 0.911 kJ kg –1 K–1 t\n\n11.8  CHANGE OF STATE\n\nMatter normally exists in three states: solid,\nliquid and gas. A transition from one of these\nstates to another is called a change of state. Two\ncommon changes of states are solid to liquid\nand liquid to gas (and, vice versa). These changes\ncan occur when the exchange of heat takes place\nbetween the substance and its surroundings.\nTo study the change of state on heating or\ncooling, let us perform the following activity.\n\nTake some cubes of ice in a beaker. Note the\ntemperature of ice. Start heating it slowly on a\nconstant heat source. Note the temperature after\nevery  minute.  Continuously stir the mixture of\nwater and ice. Draw a graph between\ntemperature and time (Fig. 11.9). You will\nobserve no change in the temperature as long\nas there is ice in the beaker. In the above process,\nthe temperature of the system does not change\neven though heat is being continuously supplied.\nThe heat supplied  is being utilised in changing\nthe state from solid (ice) to liquid (water).\n\nFig. 11.9 A plot of temperature versus time showing\nthe changes in the state of ice on heating\n\n(not to scale).\n\nThe change of state from solid to liquid is\ncalled melting and from liquid to solid is called\nfusion. It is observed that the temperature\nremains constant until the entire amount of the\nsolid substance melts. That is, both the solid\nand the liquid states of the substance coexist\nin thermal equilibrium during the change of\n\nstates from solid to liquid. The temperature\nat which the solid and the liquid states of the\nsubstance is in thermal equilibrium with each\nother is called its melting point. It is\ncharacteristic of the substance. It also depends\non pressure. The melting point of a substance\nat standard atomspheric pressure is called its\nnormal melting point. Let us do the following\nactivity to understand the process of melting\nof ice.\n\nTake a slab of ice. Take a metallic wire and\nfix two blocks, say 5 kg each, at its ends. Put\nthe wire over the slab as shown in Fig. 11.10.\nYou will observe that the wire passes through\nthe ice slab. This happens due to the fact that\njust below the wire, ice melts at lower\ntemperature due to increase in pressure. When\nthe wire has passed, water above the wire freezes\nagain. Thus, the wire passes through the slab\nand the slab does not split. This phenomenon\nof refreezing is called regelation. Skating is\npossible on snow due to the formation of water\nunder the skates. Water is formed due to the\nincrease of pressure and it acts as a\nlubricant.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTHERMAL PROPERTIES OF MATTER 287\n\nFig. 11.10\n\nAfter the whole of ice gets converted into water\nand as we continue further heating, we shall see\nthat temperature begins to rise (Fig.11.9). The\ntemperature keeps on rising till it reaches nearly\n\n100 °C when it again becomes steady. The heat\nsupplied is now being utilised to change water\nfrom liquid state to vapour or  gaseous state.\n\nThe change of state from liquid to vapour (or\ngas) is called vaporisation. It is observed that\nthe temperature remains constant until the\nentire amount of the liquid is converted into\nvapour. That is, both the liquid and vapour states\nof the substance coexist in thermal equilibrium,\nduring the change of state from liquid to vapour.\nThe temperature at which the liquid and the\nvapour states of the substance coexist is called\nits boiling point. Let us do the following activity\nto understand the process of boiling of water.\n\nTake a round-bottom flask, more than half\nfilled with water. Keep it over a burner and fix a\n\nTriple Point\n\nThe temperature of a substance remains constant during its change of state (phase change).\nA graph between the temperature T and the Pressure P of the substance is called a phase\ndiagram or P – T diagram. The following figure shows the phase diagram of water and CO\n\n2\n.\n\nSuch a phase diagram divides the P – T plane into a solid-region, the vapour-region and the\nliquid-region. The regions are separated by the curves such as sublimation curve (BO), fusion\ncurve (AO) and vaporisation curve (CO). The points on sublimation curve represent states\nin which solid and vapour phases coexist. The point on the sublimation curve BO represent\nstates in which the solid and vapour phases co-exist. Points on the fusion curve AO represent\nstates in which solid and liquid phase coexist. Points on the vapourisation curve CO represent\nstates in which the liquid and vapour phases coexist. The temperature and pressure at which\nthe fusion curve, the vaporisation curve and the sublimation curve meet and all the three\nphases of  a substance coexist is called the triple point of the substance. For example the\ntriple point of water is represented by the temperature 273.16 K and pressure 6.11×10–3 Pa.\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFig. 11.11:  Pressure-temperature phase diagrams for (a) water and (b) CO\n2\n (not to the scale).\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n288 PHYSICS\n\nthermometer and steam outlet through the cork\nof the flask (Fig. 11.11). As water gets heated in\nthe flask, note first that the air, which was\ndissolved in the water, will come out as small\nbubbles. Later, bubbles of steam will form at\nthe bottom but as they rise to the cooler water\nnear the top, they condense and disappear.\nFinally, as the temperature of the entire mass\nof the water reaches 100 °C, bubbles of steam\nreach the surface and boiling is said to occur.\nThe steam in the flask may not be visible but as\nit comes out of the flask, it condenses as tiny\ndroplets of water, giving a foggy appearance.\n\nFig. 11.11 Boiling process.\n\nIf now the steam outlet is closed for a few\nseconds to increase the pressure in the flask,\nyou will notice that boiling stops. More heat\nwould be required to raise the temperature\n(depending on the increase in pressure) before\nboiling begins again. Thus boiling point increases\nwith increase in pressure.\n\nLet us now remove the burner. Allow water to\ncool to about 80 °C. Remove the thermometer and\nsteam outlet. Close the flask with the airtight\n\ncork. Keep the f lask turned upside down on the\nstand. Pour ice-cold water on the flask. Water\nvapours in the flask condense reducing the\npressure on the water surface inside the flask.\nWater begins to boil again, now at a lower\ntemperature. Thus boiling point decreases with\ndecrease in pressure.\n\nThis explains why cooking is difficult on hills.\nAt high altitudes, atmospheric pressure is lower,\nreducing the boiling point of water as compared\nto that at sea level. On the other hand, boiling\npoint is increased inside a pressure cooker by\nincreasing the pressure. Hence cooking is faster.\nThe boiling point of a substance at standard\natmospheric pressure is called its normal\nboiling point.\n\nHowever, all substances do not pass through\nthe three states: solid-liquid-gas. There are\ncertain substances which normally pass from\nthe solid to the vapour state directly and vice\nversa. The change from solid state to vapour\nstate without passing through the liquid state\nis called sublimation, and the substance is said\nto sublime. Dry ice (solid CO\n\n2\n) sublimes, so also\n\niodine. During the sublimation process both the\nsolid and vapour states of a substance coexist\nin thermal equilibrium.\n\n11.8.1  Latent Heat\n\nIn Section 11.8, we have learnt that certain\namount of heat energy is transferred between a\nsubstance and its surroundings when it\nundergoes a change of state. The amount of heat\nper unit mass transferred during change of state\nof the substance is called latent heat of the\nsubstance for the process. For example, if heat\nis added to a given quantity of ice at –10 °C, the\ntemperature of ice increases until it reaches its\nmelting point (0 °C). At this temperature, the\naddition of more heat does not increase the\ntemperature but causes the ice to melt, or\nchanges its state. Once the entire ice melts,\nadding more heat will cause the temperature of\nthe water to rise. A similar situation\noccurs during liquid gas change of state at the\nboiling point. Adding more heat to boiling water\ncauses vaporisation, without increase in\ntemperature.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTHERMAL PROPERTIES OF MATTER 289\n\nt\n\nThe heat required during a change of state\ndepends upon the heat of transformation and\nthe mass of the substance undergoing a change\nof state. Thus, if mass m of a substance\nundergoes a change from one state to the other,\nthen the quantity of heat required is given by\n\nQ = m L\n\nor L = Q/m (11.13)\nwhere L is known as latent heat and is a\ncharacteristic of the substance. Its SI unit is\nJ kg–1. The value of L also depends on the\npressure. Its value is usually quoted at standard\natmospheric pressure. The latent heat for a solid-\nliquid state change is called the latent heat of\nfusion (L\n\nf\n), and that for a liquid-gas state change\n\nis called the latent heat of vaporisation (L\nv\n).\n\nThese are often referred to as the heat of fusion\nand the heat of vaporisation. A plot of\ntemperature versus heat  for a quantity of water\nis shown in Fig. 11.12. The latent heats of some\nsubstances, their freezing and boiling points, are\ngiven in Table 11.5.\n\nFig. 11.12 Temperature versus heat for water at\n\n1 atm pressure (not to scale).\n\nNote that when heat is added (or removed)\nduring a change of state, the temperature\nremains constant. Note in Fig. 11.12 that the\nslopes of the phase lines are not all the same,\nwhich indicate that specific heats of the various\nstates are not equal. For water, the latent heat of\nfusion and vaporisation are L\n\nf\n = 3.33 × 105 J kg–1\n\nand L\nv\n = 22.6 × 105 J kg–1, respectively. That is,\n\n3.33 × 105 J of heat is needed to melt 1 kg ice at\n0 °C, and 22.6 × 105 J of heat is needed to convert\n1 kg  water into steam at 100 °C. So, steam at\n100 °C carries  22.6 × 105 J  kg–1 more heat than\nwater at 100 °C. This is why burns from steam\nare usually more serious than those from\nboiling water.\n\nExample 11.4 When 0.15 kg of ice at 0 °C\nis mixed with 0.30 kg of water at 50 °C in a\ncontainer, the resulting temperature is\n6.7 °C.

What are the different\nways by which this energy transfer takes\nplace? There are three distinct modes of heat\ntransfer: conduction, convection and radiation\n(Fig. 11.13).\n\nFig. 11.13 Heating by conduction, convection and\n\nradiation.\n\n11.9.1  Conduction\n\nConduction is the mechanism of transfer of heat\nbetween two adjacent parts of a body because\nof their temperature difference. Suppose, one end\nof a metallic rod is put in a flame, the other end\nof the rod will soon be so hot that you cannot\nhold it by your bare hands. Here, heat transfer\ntakes place by conduction from the hot end of\nthe rod through its different parts to the other\nend.  Gases are poor thermal conductors, while\nliquids have conductivities intermediate between\nsolids and gases.\n\nHeat conduction may be described\nquantitatively as the time rate of heat flow in a\nmaterial for a given temperature difference.\nConsider a metallic bar of length L and uniform\ncross-section A with its two ends maintained at\ndifferent temperatures. This can be done, for\nexample, by putting the ends in thermal contact\nwith large reservoirs at temperatures, say, T\n\nC \nand\n\nT\nD\n, respectively (Fig. 11.14). Let us assume the\n\nideal condition that the sides of the bar are fully\ninsulated so that no heat is exchanged between\nthe sides and the surroundings.\n\nAfter sometime, a steady state is reached; the\ntemperature of the bar decreases uniformly with\ndistance from T\n\nC\n to T\n\nD\n; (T\n\nC\n>T\n\nD\n). The reservoir at\n\nC supplies heat at a constant rate, which\ntransfers through the bar and is given out at\nthe same rate to the reservoir at D. It is found\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTHERMAL PROPERTIES OF MATTER 291\n\nt\n\nexperimentally that in this steady state, the rate\nof flow of heat (or heat current) H is proportional\nto the temperature difference (T\n\nC\n – T\n\nD\n) and the\n\narea of cross-section A and is inversely\nproportional to the length L :\n\nH = KA \n–C DT T\nL\n\n(11.14)\n\nThe constant of proportionality K is called the\nthermal conductivity of the material. The\ngreater the value of K for a material, the more\nrapidly will it conduct heat. The SI unit of K is\nJ s–1 m –1 K–1 or W m –1 K–1. The thermal\nconductivities of various substances are listed\nin Table 11.6. These values vary slightly with\ntemperature, but can be considered to be\nconstant over a normal temperature range.\n\nCompare the relatively large thermal\nconductivities of  good thermal conductors and,\nmetals, with the relatively small thermal\nconductivities of some good thermal insulators,\nsuch as wood and glass wool. You may have\nnoticed that some cooking pots have copper\ncoating on the bottom. Being a good conductor\nof heat, copper promotes the distribution of heat\nover the bottom of a pot for uniform cooking.\nPlastic foams, on the other hand, are good\ninsulators, mainly because they contain pockets\nof air. Recall that gases are poor conductors,\nand note the low thermal conductivity of air in\nthe Table 11.5. Heat retention and transfer are\nimportant in many other applications. Houses\nmade of concrete roofs get very hot during\nsummer days because thermal conductivity of\nconcrete (though much smaller than that of a\nmetal) is still not small enough. Therefore, people,\nusually, prefer to give a layer of earth or foam\ninsulation on the ceiling so that heat transfer is\n\nprohibited and keeps the room cooler. In some\nsituations, heat transfer is critical. In a nuclear\nreactor, for example, elaborate heat transfer\nsystems need to be installed so that the\nenormous energy produced by nuclear fission\nin the core transits out sufficiently fast, thus\npreventing the core from overheating.\n\nTable 11.6 Thermal conductivities of some\n      material\n\nMaterial Thermal conductivity\n(J s–1 m–1 K–1 )\n\nMetals\n\nSilver 406\nCopper 385\nAluminium 205\nBrass 109\nSteel 50.2\nLead 34.7\nMercury 8.3\n\nNon-metals\n\nInsulating brick 0.15\nConcrete 0.8\nBody fat 0.20\nFelt 0.04\nGlass 0.8\nIce 1.6\nGlass wool 0.04\nWood 0.12\nWater 0.8\n\nGases\n\nAir 0.024\nArgon 0.016\nHydrogen 0.14\n\nExample 11.6 What is the temperature of\nthe steel-copper junction in the steady\nstate of the system shown in Fig. 11.15.\nLength of the steel rod = 15.0 cm, length\nof the copper rod = 10.0 cm, temperature\nof the furnace = 300 °C, temperature of\nthe other end = 0 °C.

It is  possible only in fluids.\nConvection can be natural or forced. In natural\nconvection, gravity plays an important part.\nWhen a fluid is heated from below, the hot part\nexpands and, therefore, becomes less dense.\nBecause of buoyancy, it rises and the upper\ncolder part replaces it. This again gets heated,\nrises up and is replaced by the relatively colder\npart of the fluid. The process goes on. This mode\nof heat transfer is evidently different from\nconduction. Convection involves bulk transport\nof different parts of the fluid.\n     In forced convection, material is forced to move\nby a pump or by some other physical means. The\ncommon  examples of forced convection systems\nare forced-air heating systems in home, the\nhuman circulatory system, and the cooling\nsystem of an automobile engine. In the human\nbody, the heart acts as the pump that circulates\nblood through different parts of the body,\ntransferring heat by forced convection and\nmaintaining it at a uniform temperature.\n\nNatural convection is responsible for many\nfamiliar phenomena. During the day, the\nground heats up more quickly than large bodies\n\nof water do. This occurs both because water has\na greater specific heat capacity and because\nmixing currents disperse the absorbed heat\nthroughout the great volume of water. The air\nin contact with the warm ground is heated by\nconduction. It expands, becoming less dense\nthan the surrounding cooler air. As a result, the\nwarm air rises (air currents) and the other air\nmoves (winds) to fill the space-creating a sea\nbreeze near a large body of water. Cooler air\ndescends, and a thermal convection cycle is set\nup, which transfers heat away from the land.\nAt night, the ground loses its heat more quickly,\nand the water surface is warmer than the land.\nAs a result, the cycle is reveresed (Fig. 11.17).\n\nThe other example of natural convection is\nthe steady surface wind on the earth blowing\nin from north-east towards the equator, the\nso-called trade wind. A resonable explanation\nis as follows: the equatorial and polar regions of\nthe earth receive unequal solar heat. Air at the\nearth’s surface near the equator is hot, while\nthe air in the upper atmosphere of the poles is\ncool. In the absence of any other factor, a\nconvection current would be set up, with the\nair at the equatorial surface rising and moving\nout towards the poles, descending and\nstreaming in towards the equator. The rotation\nof the earth, however, modifies this convection\ncurrent. Because of this, air close to the equator\nhas an eastward speed of 1600 km/h, while it\nis zero close to the poles. As a result, the air\ndescends not at the poles but at 30° N (North)\nlatitude and returns to the equator. This is\ncalled trade wind.\n\nFig. 11.17 Convection cycles.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n294 PHYSICS\n\n11.9.3  Radiation\n\nConduction and convection require some\nmaterial as a transport medium. These modes\nof heat transfer cannot operate between bodies\nseparated by a distance in vacuum. But the\nearth does receive heat from the Sun across a\nhuge distance. Similarly, we quickly feel the\nwarmth of the fire nearby even though air\nconducts poorly and before convection takes\nsome time to set in. The third mechanism for\nheat transfer needs no medium; it is called\nradiation and the energy so transferred by\nelectromagnetic waves is called radiant energy.\nIn an electromagnetic wave, electric and\nmagnetic fields oscillate in space and time. Like\nany wave, electromagnetic waves can have\ndifferent wavelengths and can travel in vacuum\nwith the same speed, namely the speed of light\ni.e., 3 × 108 m s–1 . You will learn these matters\nin more detail later, but you now know why heat\ntransfer by radiation does not need any medium\nand why it is so fast. This is how heat is\ntransferred to the earth from the Sun through\nempty space. All bodies emit radiant energy,\nwhether they are solid, liquid or gas.  The\nelectromagnetic radiation emitted by a body by\nvirtue of its temperature, like radiation by a red\nhot iron or light from a filament lamp is called\nthermal radiation.\n\nWhen this thermal radiation falls on other\nbodies, it is partly reflected and partly absorbed.\nThe amount of heat that a body can absorb by\nradiation depends on the colour of the body.\n\nWe find that black bodies absorb and emit\nradiant energy better than  bodies of lighter\ncolours. This fact finds many applications in our\ndaily life. We wear white or light coloured clothes\nin summer, so that they absorb the least heat\nfrom the Sun. However, during winter, we use\ndark coloured clothes, which absorb heat from\nthe sun and keep our body warm. The bottoms of\nutensils for cooking food are blackened so that\nthey absorb maximum heat from fire and transfer\nit to the vegetables to be cooked.\n\nSimilarly, a Dewar flask or thermos bottle is\na device to minimise heat transfer between the\ncontents of the bottle and outside. It consists\nof a double-walled glass vessel with the inner\nand outer walls coated with silver. Radiation\nfrom the inner wall is reflected back to the\n\ncontents of the bottle. The outer wall similarly\nreflects back any incoming radiation. The space\nbetween the walls is evacuted to reduce\nconduction and convection losses and the flask\nis supported on an insulator, like cork. The\ndevice is, therefore, useful for preventing hot\ncontents (like, milk) from getting cold, or\nalternatively, to store cold contents (like, ice).\n\n11.9.4 Blackbody Radiation\n\nWe have so far not mentioned the wavelength\ncontent of thermal radiation. The important\nthing about thermal radiation at any\ntemperature is that it is not of one (or a few)\nwavelength(s) but has a continuous spectrum\nfrom the small to the long wavelengths. The\nenergy content of radiation, however, varies for\ndifferent wavelengths. Figure 11.18 gives the\nexperimental curves for radiation energy per unit\narea per unit wavelength emitted by a blackbody\nversus wavelength for different temperatures.\n\nFig. 11.18:  Energy emitted versus wavelength\nfor a blackbody at different\n\ntemperatures\n\nNotice that the wavelength λ\nm\n for which energy\n\nis the maximum decreases with increasing\ntemperature. The relation between λ\n\nm\n and T is\n\ngiven by what is known as Wien’s Displacement\nLaw:\n\nλ\nm\n T  =  constant (11.15)\n\nThe value of the constant (Wien’s constant)\nis 2.9 × 10–3 m K. This law explains why the\ncolour of a piece of iron heated in a hot flame\nfirst becomes dull red, then reddish yellow, and\nfinally white hot. Wien’s law is useful for\nestimating the surface temperatures of celestial\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTHERMAL PROPERTIES OF MATTER 295\n\nbodies like, the moon, Sun and other stars. Light\nfrom the moon is found to have a maximum\nintensity near the wavelength 14 µm. By Wien’s\nlaw, the surface of the moon is estimated to have\na temperature of 200 K. Solar radiation has a\nmaximum at λ\n\nm\n = 4753 Å. This corresponds to\n\nT = 6060 K. Remember, this is the temperature\nof the surface of the sun, not its interior.\n\nThe most significant feature of the\nblackbody radiation curves in Fig. 11.18 is that\nthey are universal. They depend only on the\ntemperature and not on the size, shape or\nmaterial of the blackbody. Attempts to explain\nblackbody radiation theoretically, at the\nbeginning of the twentieth century, spurred the\nquantum revolution in physics, as you will\nlearn in later courses.\n\nEnergy can be transferred by radiation over\nlarge distances, without a medium (i.e., in\nvacuum). The total electromagnetic energy\nradiated by a body at absolute temperature T\nis proportional to its size, its ability to radiate\n(called emissivity)  and most importantly to its\ntemperature. For a body, which is a perfect\nradiator, the energy emitted per unit time (H)\nis given by\n\nH = AσT 4 (11.16)\n\nwhere A  is the area and T is the absolute\ntemperature of the body.  This relation obtained\nexperimentally by Stefan and later proved\ntheoretically by Boltzmann is known as Stefan-\nBoltzmann law and the constant σ is called\nStefan-Boltzmann constant. Its value in SI units\nis 5.67 × 10–8 W m–2 K–4. Most bodies emit only a\nfraction of the rate given by Eq. 11.16. A substance\nlike lamp black comes close to the limit. One,\ntherefore, defines a dimensionless fraction e\ncalled emissivity and writes,\n\nH = AeσT 4 (11.17)\nHere, e = 1 for a perfect radiator. For a tungsten\nlamp, for example, e is about 0.4. Thus, a tungsten\nlamp at a temperature of 3000 K and a surface\narea of 0.3 cm2 radiates at the rate  H = 0.3 ×\n10–4 × 0.4 × 5.67 × 10–8 × (3000)4 = 60 W.\n\nA body at temperature T, with surroundings\nat temperatures T\n\ns\n, emits, as well as, receives\n\nenergy. For a perfect radiator, the net rate of\nloss of radiant energy is\n\nH = σA (T 4 – T\ns\n4)\n\nFor a body with emissivity e, the relation\nmodifies to\n\nH = eσ A (T4 – T\ns\n4) (11.18)\n\nAs an example, let us estimate the heat\nradiated by our bodies. Suppose the surface area\nof a person’s body is about 1.9 m2 and the room\ntemperature is 22°C. The internal body\ntemperature, as we know, is about 37 °C.  The\nskin temperature may be 28°C (say). The\nemissivity of the skin is about 0.97 for the\nrelevant region of electromagnetic radiation. The\nrate of heat loss is:\n\nH = 5.67 × 10–8 × 1.9 × 0.97 × {(301)4 – (295)4}\n\n = 66.4 W\n\nwhich is more than half the rate of energy\nproduction by the body at rest (120 W). To\nprevent this heat loss effectively (better than\nordinary clothing), modern arctic clothing has\nan additional thin shiny metallic layer next to\nthe skin, which reflects the body’s radiation.\n\n11.9.5 Greenhouse Effect\n\nThe earth’s surface  is a source of  thermal\nradiation as it absorbs energy received from the\nSun. The wavelength of this radiation lies in the\nlong wavelength (infrared) region.  But a large\nportion of this radiation is absorbed by\ngreenhouse gases, namely,  carbon dioxide\n(CO\n\n2\n); methane (CH\n\n4\n); nitrous oxide (N\n\n2\nO);\n\nchlorofluorocarbon (CF\nx\nCl\n\nx\n); and tropospheric\n\nozone  (O\n3\n). This heats up the atmosphere which,\n\nin turn, gives more energy to earth, resulting in\nwarmer surface. This increases the intensity of\nradiation from the surface. The cycle of\nprocesses described above is repeated until no\nradiation is available for absorption. The net\nresult is heating up of earth’s surface and\natmosphere. This is known as Greenhouse\nEffect. Without the Greenhouse Effect, the\ntemperature of the earth would have been –18°C.\n\nConcentration of greenhouse gases has\nenhanced due to human activities, making the\nearth warmer. According to an estimate, average\ntemperature of earth has increased by 0.3 to\n0.6°C, since the beginning of this century\nbecause of this enhancement. By the middle of\nthe next century, the earth’s global temperature\nmay be 1 to 3°C higher than today. This global\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n296 PHYSICS\n\nwarming may cause problem for human life,\nplants and animals. Because of global warming,\nice caps are melting faster, sea level is rising,\nand weather pattern is changing. Many coastal\ncities are at the risk of getting submerged. The\nenhanced Greenhouse Effect may also result in\nexpansion of deserts. All over the world, efforts\nare being made to minimise the effect of global\nwarming.\n\n11.10  NEWTON’S LAW OF COOLING\n\nWe all know that hot water or milk when left on\na table begins to cool, gradually. Ultimately it\nattains the temperature of the surroundings. To\nstudy how slow or fast a given body can cool on\nexchanging heat with its surroundings, let us\nperform the following activity.\n\nTake some water, say 300 mL, in a\ncalorimeter with a stirrer and cover it with a\ntwo-holed lid. Fix the stirrer through one hole\nand fix a thermometer through another hole\nin the lid and make sure that the bulb of\nthermometer is immersed in the water. Note\nthe reading of the thermometer. This reading\nT\n\n1\n is the temperature of the surroundings.\n\nHeat the water kept in the calorimeter till it\nattains a temperature, say 40 °C above room\ntemperature ( i .e. ,  temperature of the\nsurroundings). Then, stop heating the water\nby removing the heat source. Start the\nstop-watch and note the reading of the\nthermometer after a fixed interval of time, say\nafter every one minute of stirring gently with\nthe stirrer. Continue to note the temperature\n(T\n\n2\n) of water till it attains a temperature about\n\n5 °C above that of the surroundings. Then, plot\na graph by taking each value of temperature\n∆T = T\n\n2\n – T\n\n1\n along y-axis and the coresponding\n\nvalue of  t along x-axis (Fig. 11.19).\n\nFig. 11.19 Curve showing cooling of hot water\nwith time.\n\nFrom the graph you can infer how the cooling\nof hot water depends on the difference of its\ntemperature from that of the surroundings. You\nwill also notice that initially the rate of cooling\nis higher and decreases as the temperature of\nthe body falls.\n\nThe above activity shows that a hot body loses\nheat to its surroundings in the form of heat\nradiation. The rate of loss of heat depends on\nthe difference in temperature between the body\nand its surroundings. Newton was the first to\nstudy, in a systematic manner, the relation\nbetween the heat lost by a body in a given\nenclosure and its temperature.\n\nAccording to Newton’s law of cooling, the rate\nof loss of heat, – dQ/dt of the body is directly\nproportional to the difference of temperature\n∆T = (T\n\n2\n–T\n\n1\n) of the body and the surroundings.\n\nThe law holds good only for small difference of\ntemperature. Also, the loss of  heat by radiation\ndepends upon the nature of the surface of the\nbody and the area of the exposed surface. We\ncan write\n\n– (11.19)\n\nwhere k is a positive constant depending upon\nthe area and nature of the surface of the body.\nSuppose a body of mass m and specific heat\ncapacity s is at temperature T\n\n2\n. Let T\n\n1\n be the\n\ntemperature of the surroundings. If the\ntemperature falls by a small amount dT\n\n2\n in time\n\ndt, then the amount of heat lost is\ndQ = ms dT\n\n2\n\n∴ Rate of loss of heat is given by\n\ndQ\n\ndt\nms\n\ndT\n\ndt\n= 2 (11.20)\n\nFrom Eqs. (11.15) and (11.16) we have\n\n– ( – )m s\ndT\n\ndt\nk T T2 2 1=\n\ndT\n\nT T\n\nk\n\nms\ndt K dt2\n\n2 1–\n– –= = (11.21)\n\nwhere K = k/m s\n\nOn integrating,\n\nlog\ne\n (T\n\n2\n – T\n\n1\n) = – K t + c (11.22)\n\nor T\n2 \n= T\n\n1 \n+ C′ e–Kt; where C′ = ec (11.23)\n\nEquation 11.23 enables you to calculate the\ntime of cooling of a body through a particular\nrange of temperature.\n\n∆\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTHERMAL PROPERTIES OF MATTER 297\n\nt\n\nFor small temperature differences, the rate\nof cooling, due to conduction, convection, and\nradiation combined, is proportional to the\ndifference in temperature. It is a valid\napproximation in the transfer of heat from a\nradiator to a room, the loss of heat through the\nwall of a room, or the cooling of a cup of tea on\nthe table.\n\nFig. 11.20 Verification of Newton’s Law of cooling.\n\nNewton’s law of cooling can be verified with\nthe help of the experimental set-up shown in\nFig. 11.20(a). The set-up consists of a double-\nwalled vessel (V) containing water  between\nthe two walls. A copper calorimeter (C)\ncontaining hot water is placed inside the\ndouble-walled vessel. Two thermometers\nthrough the corks are used to note the\ntemperatures T\n\n2\n of water in calorimeter and\n\nT\n1\n of hot water in between the double walls,\n\nrespectively. Temperature of hot water in the\ncalorimeter is noted after equal intervals of\n\ntime. A graph is plotted between log\ne\n (T\n\n2\n–T\n\n1\n)\n\n[or ln(T\n2\n–T\n\n1\n)] and time (t ). The nature of the\n\ngraph is observed to be a straight line having\na negative slope as shown in Fig. 11.20(b). This\nis in support of Eq. 11.22.\n\nExample 11.8  A pan filled with hot food\ncools from 94 °C to 86 °C in 2 minutes when\nthe room temperature is at 20 °C. How long\nwill it take to cool from 71 °C to 69 °C?\n\nAnswer  The average temperature of 94 °C and\n86 °C is 90 °C, which is 70 °C above the room\ntemperature. Under these conditions the pan\ncools 8 °C in 2 minutes.\n\nUsing Eq. (11.21), we have\n\nChange in temperature\nTime\n\nK T= ∆\n\n( )\n°\n\n°\n8 C\n\n= 70 C\n2 min\n\nK\n\nThe average of 69 °C and 71 °C is 70 °C, which\nis 50 °C above room temperature. K is the same\nfor this situation as for the original.\n\n°2 C\nTime\n\n = K (50 °C)\n\nWhen we divide above two equations, we\nhave\n\n8 C/2 min (70 C)\n=\n\n2 C/time (50 C)\nK\n\nK\n\n° °\n° °\n\nTime = 0.7 min\n\n        = 42 s t\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. Heat is a form of energy that flows between a body and its surrounding medium by\nvirtue of temperature difference between them. The degree of hotness of the body is\nquantitatively represented by temperature.\n\n2. A temperature-measuring device (thermometer) makes use of some measurable property\n(called thermometric property) that changes with temperature. Different thermometers\nlead to different temperature scales. To construct a temperature scale, two fixed points\nare chosen and assigned some arbitrary values of temperature. The two numbers fix\nthe origin of the scale and the size of its unit.\n\n3. The Celsius temperature (t\nC\n) and the Farenheit temperare (t\n\nF\n)are related by\n\nt\nF\n = (9/5) t\n\nC\n + 32\n\n4. The ideal gas equation connecting pressure (P), volume (V) and absolute temperature (T)\nis :\n\nPV = µRT\nwhere µ is the number of moles and R is the universal gas constant.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n298 PHYSICS\n\n5. In the absolute temperature scale, the zero of the scale  corresponds to the temperature\nwhere every substance in nature has the least possible molecular activity. The Kelvin\nabsolute temperature scale (T ) has the same unit size as the Celsius scale (T\n\nc \n), but\n\ndiffers in the origin :\n\nT\nC\n   =  T – 273.15\n\n6. The coefficient of linear expansion (α\nl\n) and volume expansion (αv ) are defined by the\n\nrelations :\n\nl\n\nl\nT\n\nl\nα\n\n∆\n= ∆\n\nV\n\nV\nT\n\nV\nα\n\n∆\n= ∆\n\nwhere ∆l  and  ∆V denote the change in length l and volume V for a change of temperature\n∆T.  The relation between them is :\n\nαv  =  3 αl\n\n7. The specific heat capacity of a substance is defined by\n\ns\nm\n\nQ\n\nT\n=\n\n1 ∆\n∆\n\nwhere m is the mass of the substance and ∆Q is the heat required to change its\ntemperature by ∆T.  The molar specific heat capacity of a substance is defined by\n\n1 Q\nC\n\nTµ\n∆\n\n=\n∆\n\nwhere µ is the number  of moles of the substance.\n\n8. The latent heat of fusion (L\nf\n) is the heat per unit mass required to change a substance\n\nfrom solid into liquid at the same temperature and pressure. The latent heat of\nvaporisation (L\n\nv\n) is the heat per unit mass required to change a substance from liquid\n\nto the vapour state without change in the temperature and pressure.\n\n9. The three modes of heat transfer are conduction, convection and radiation.\n\n10. In conduction, heat is transferred between neighbouring parts of a body through\nmolecular collisions, without any flow of matter.  For a bar of length L and uniform\ncross section A with its ends maintained at temperatures T\n\nC\n and T\n\nD\n, the rate of flow of\n\nheat H is :\n\n C D \nT T\n\nH = K A\nL\n\n−\n\nwhere K is the thermal conductivity of the material of the bar.\n\n11. Newton’s Law of Cooling says that the rate of cooling of a body is proportional to the\nexcess temperature of the body over the surroundings :\n\n2 1\n\nd\n( )\n\nd\nQ\n\n = – k T  – T    \nt\n\nWhere T\n1\n is the temperature of the surrounding medium and T\n\n2\n is the temperature of\n\nthe body.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTHERMAL PROPERTIES OF MATTER 299\n\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n\n1. The relation connecting Kelvin temperature (T ) and the Celsius temperature t\nc\n\nT  =  t\nc\n + 273.15\n\nand the assignment T = 273.16 K for the triple point of water are exact relations (by\nchoice). With this choice, the Celsius temperature of the melting point of water and\nboiling point of water (both at 1 atm pressure) are very close to, but not exactly equal\nto 0 °C and 100 °C respectively.  In the original Celsius scale, these latter fixed points\nwere exactly at 0 °C and 100 °C (by choice), but now the triple point of water is the\npreferred choice for the fixed point, because it has a unique temperature.\n\n2. A liquid in equilibrium with vapour has the same pressure and temperature throughout\nthe system; the two phases in equilibrium differ in their molar volume (i.e. density).\nThis is true for a system with any number of phases in equilibrium.\n\n3. Heat transfer always involves temperature difference between two systems or two parts\nof the same system. Any energy transfer that does not involve temperature difference\nin some way is not heat.\n\n4. Convection involves flow of matter within a fluid due to unequal temperatures of its\nparts. A hot bar placed under a running tap loses heat by conduction between the\nsurface of the bar and water and not by convection within water.\n\nEXERCISES\n\n11.1 The triple points of neon and carbon dioxide are 24.57 K and 216.55 K respectively.\nExpress these temperatures on the Celsius and Fahrenheit scales.\n\n11.2 Two absolute scales A and B have triple points of water defined to be 200 A and    350\nB.
