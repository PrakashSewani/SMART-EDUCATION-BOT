We restricted ourselves to simpler\nsituations of rigid bodies.  A rigid body generally means a\nhard solid object having a definite shape and size.  But in\nreality,  bodies can be stretched, compressed and bent. Even\nthe  appreciably  rigid  steel bar can be deformed when a\nsufficiently large external force is applied on it.  This means\nthat solid bodies are not perfectly rigid.\n\nA solid has  definite shape and size. In order to change (or\ndeform) the shape or size of a body, a force  is required. If\nyou stretch a helical spring by gently pulling its ends, the\nlength of the spring increases slightly. When you leave the\nends of the spring, it regains its original size and shape.  The\nproperty of a body, by virtue of  which  it tends to regain its\noriginal size and shape when the applied force is removed, is\nknown as elasticity and the deformation caused is known\nas elastic deformation. However, if you apply force to a lump\nof putty or mud, they have no gross tendency to regain their\nprevious shape, and they get permanently deformed. Such\nsubstances are called plastic and this property is called\nplasticity. Putty and mud are close to ideal plastics.\n\n The elastic behaviour of materials plays an important role\nin engineering design.  For example, while designing a\nbuilding, knowledge of elastic properties of materials like steel,\nconcrete etc. is essential.  The same is true in the design of\nbridges, automobiles, ropeways etc.  One could also ask  —\nCan we design an aeroplane which is very  light  but\nsufficiently  strong?  Can we design an artificial limb which\nis lighter but stronger?  Why does a railway track have a\nparticular shape  like I?  Why  is glass brittle while brass is\nnot?  Answers to such questions begin with the study of how\nrelatively  simple kinds of loads or forces act to deform\ndifferent solids bodies.  In this chapter, we  shall study the\n\n9.1 Introduction\n\n9.2 Elastic behaviour of solids\n\n9.3 Stress and strain\n\n9.4 Hooke’s law\n\n9.5 Stress-strain curve\n\n9.6 Elastic moduli\n\n9.7 Applications of elastic\nbehaviour of materials\n\nSummary\n\nPoints to ponder\n\nExercises\n\nAdditional exercises\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n236 PHYSICS\n\nelastic behaviour and mechanical properties of\nsolids which  would answer many such\nquestions.\n\n9.2  ELASTIC BEHAVIOUR OF SOLIDS\n\nWe know that in a solid, each atom or molecule\nis surrounded by neighbouring atoms or\nmolecules. These are bonded together by\ninteratomic or intermolecular forces and stay\nin a stable equilibrium position. When a solid is\ndeformed, the  atoms or molecules are displaced\nfrom their equilibrium positions causing a\nchange in the interatomic   (or intermolecular)\ndistances. When the deforming force is removed,\nthe interatomic forces tend to drive them back\nto their original positions. Thus the body regains\nits original shape and size.  The restoring\nmechanism can be visualised by taking a model\nof spring-ball system shown in the Fig. 9.1. Here\nthe balls represent atoms and springs represent\ninteratomic forces.\n\nFig. 9.1 Spring-ball model for the illustration of elastic\n\nbehaviour of solids.\n\nIf you try to displace any ball from its\nequilibrium position, the spring system tries to\nrestore the ball back to its original position. Thus\nelastic behaviour of  solids can be explained in\nterms of microscopic nature of the solid.  Robert\nHooke, an English  physicist  (1635 - 1703 A.D)\nperformed experiments on springs and found\nthat the elongation (change in the  length)\nproduced in a body is proportional to the applied\nforce or load.  In 1676, he presented his law of\n\nelasticity, now called Hooke’s  law.  We shall\nstudy about it in Section 9.4. This law, like\nBoyle’s law, is one of the earliest quantitative\nrelationships in science.  It is very important to\nknow the behaviour of the materials under\nvarious kinds of load from the context of\nengineering design.\n\n9.3  STRESS AND STRAIN\n\nWhen  forces are applied on a body in such a\n\nmanner that the body is still in static equilibrium,\nit is deformed to a small or large extent depending\n\nupon the nature of the material of the body and\nthe magnitude of the deforming force.  The\ndeformation may not be noticeable visually in\n\nmany materials but it is there.  When a body is\nsubjected to a deforming force, a restoring force\n\nis developed in the body.  This restoring force is\nequal in magnitude but opposite in direction to\n\nthe applied force. The restoring force per unit area\nis known as stress.  If F is the force applied normal\nto the cross–section and A  is the  area of cross\n\nsection of  the body,\nMagnitude of the stress = F/A (9.1)\nThe SI unit of stress is  N m–2 or pascal (Pa)\n\nand its dimensional formula is [ ML–1T–2 ].\nThere are three ways in which a solid may\n\nchange its dimensions when an external force\nacts on  it. These are shown in Fig. 9.2.  In\nFig.9.2(a), a cylinder is stretched by two equal\nforces applied normal to its cross-sectional area.\nThe restoring   force per unit area  in this case\nis called tensile stress. If the cylinder is\ncompressed under the action of applied forces,\nthe restoring force per unit area is known as\ncompressive stress. Tensile or compressive\nstress can also be termed as longitudinal stress.\n\nIn both the cases, there is a change in the\nlength of the cylinder. The change in the length\n∆L to the original length L of the body (cylinder\nin this case) is known as longitudinal strain.\n\nLongitudinal strain  \n∆\n\n=\nL\n\nL\n(9.2)\n\nHowever, if two equal and opposite  deforming\nforces are applied parallel to the cross-sectional\narea of the cylinder, as shown in Fig. 9.2(b),\nthere is relative displacement between the\nopposite faces of the cylinder.  The restoring force\nper unit area developed due to the applied\ntangential force is known as tangential or\nshearing stress.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF SOLIDS 237\n\nAs a result of applied tangential force, there\nis a relative displacement ∆x between opposite\nfaces of the cylinder as shown in the Fig. 9.2(b).\nThe strain so produced is known as shearing\nstrain and it is defined as the ratio of relative\ndisplacement of the faces ∆x  to the length of\nthe cylinder L.\n\nShearing strain \n∆\n\n=\nx\n\nL\n = tan θ (9.3)\n\nwhere θ is the angular displacement of the\ncylinder from the vertical (original position of\nthe cylinder). Usually  θ is very small, tan θ\nis nearly equal to angle θ, (if θ = 10°, for\nexample, there is only 1% difference between θ\nand tan θ).\n\nIt can also be visualised, when a book is\npressed with the hand and pushed horizontally,\nas shown in Fig. 9.2 (c).\n\nThus, shearing strain  = tan θ ≈ θ (9.4)\nIn Fig. 9.2 (d), a solid sphere placed in the\n\nfluid under high pressure is compressed\nuniformly on all sides. The force applied by the\nfluid acts in perpendicular direction at each\npoint of the surface and the body is said to be\nunder hydraulic compression. This leads to\ndecrease in its volume without any change of\nits geometrical shape.\n\nThe body develops internal restoring forces\nthat are equal and opposite to the forces applied\nby the fluid (the body restores its original shape\nand size when taken out from the fluid). The\ninternal restoring force per unit area in this case\n\nRobert Hooke\n(1635 – 1703 A.D.)\n\nRobert Hooke was born on July 18, 1635 in Freshwater, Isle of Wight. He was\none of the most brilliant and versatile seventeenth century English scientists.\nHe attended Oxford University but never graduated. Yet he was an extremely\ntalented inventor, instrument-maker and building designer. He assisted Robert\nBoyle in the construction of Boylean air pump. In 1662, he was appointed as\nCurator of Experiments to the newly founded Royal Society. In 1665, he became\nProfessor of Geometry in Gresham College where he carried out his astronomi-\ncal observations. He built a Gregorian reflecting telescope; discovered the fifth\nstar in the trapezium and an asterism in the constellation Orion; suggested that\nJupiter rotates on its axis; plotted detailed sketches of Mars which were later\nused in the 19th century to determine the planet’s rate of rotation; stated the\ninverse square law to describe planetary motion, which Newton modified later\netc. He was elected Fellow of Royal Society and also served as the Society’s\nSecretary from 1667 to 1682. In his series of observations presented in Micrographia, he suggested\nwave theory of light and first used the word ‘cell’ in a biological context as a result of his studies of cork.\n\nRobert Hooke is best known to physicists for his discovery of law of elasticity: Ut tensio, sic vis (This\nis a Latin expression and it means as the distortion, so the force). This law laid the basis for studies of\nstress and strain and for understanding the elastic materials.\n\n(a) (b) (c) (d)\n\nFig. 9.2 (a) A cylindrical body under tensile stress elongates by ∆L (b) Shearing stress on a cylinder deforming it by\nan angle θ (c) A body subjected to shearing stress (d) A solid body under a stress normal to the surface at\nevery point (hydraulic stress). The volumetric strain is ∆V/V, but there is no change in shape.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n238 PHYSICS\n\nis known as hydraulic stress and in magnitude\nis equal to the hydraulic pressure (applied force\nper unit area).\n\nThe strain produced by a hydraulic pressure\nis called volume strain and is defined as the\nratio of change in volume (∆V) to the original\nvolume (V ).\n\nVolume strain \n∆\n\n=\nV\n\nV\n(9.5)\n\nSince the strain is a ratio of change in\ndimension to the original dimension, it has no\nunits or dimensional formula.\n\n9.4  HOOKE’S LAW\n\nStress and strain take different forms in the\nsituations depicted in the Fig. (9.2). For small\ndeformations the stress and strain are\nproportional to each other. This is known as\nHooke’s law.\nThus,\n\nstress ∝ strain\nstress = k × strain (9.6)\n\nwhere k is the proportionality constant and is\nknown as modulus of elasticity.\n\nHooke’s law is an empirical law and is found\nto be valid for most materials. However, there\nare some materials which do not exhibit this\nlinear relationship.\n\n9.5  STRESS-STRAIN CURVE\n\nThe relation between the stress and the strain\nfor a given material under tensile stress can be\nfound experimentally. In a standard test of\ntensile properties, a test cylinder or a wire is\nstretched by an applied force. The fractional\nchange in length (the strain) and the applied\nforce needed to cause the strain are recorded.\nThe applied force is gradually increased in steps\nand the change in length is noted. A graph is\nplotted between the stress (which is equal in\nmagnitude to the applied force per unit area)\nand the strain produced. A typical graph for a\nmetal is shown in Fig. 9.3. Analogous graphs\nfor compression and shear stress may also be\nobtained. The stress-strain curves vary from\nmaterial to material. These curves help us to\nunderstand how a given material deforms with\nincreasing loads. From the graph, we can see\nthat in the region between O to A, the curve is\nlinear.  In this region, Hooke’s law is obeyed.\n\nThe body regains its original dimensions when\nthe applied force is removed. In this region, the\nsolid behaves as an elastic body.\n\nIn the region from A to B, stress and strain\nare not proportional. Nevertheless, the body still\nreturns to its original dimension when the load\nis removed. The point B in the curve is known\nas yield point (also known as elastic limit) and\nthe corresponding stress is known as yield\nstrength (σ\n\ny\n) of the material.\n\nIf the load is increased further, the stress\ndeveloped exceeds the yield strength and strain\nincreases rapidly even for a small change in the\nstress. The portion of the curve between B and\nD shows this. When the load is removed, say at\nsome point C between B and D, the body does\nnot regain its original dimension. In this case,\neven when the stress is zero, the strain is not\nzero. The material is said to have a permanent\nset. The deformation is said to be plastic\ndeformation. The point D on the graph is the\nultimate tensile strength (σ\n\nu\n) of the material.\n\nBeyond this point, additional strain is produced\neven by a reduced applied force and fracture\noccurs at point E. If the ultimate strength and\nfracture points D and E are close, the material\nis said to be brittle. If they are far apart, the\nmaterial is said to be ductile.\n\nAs stated earlier, the stress-strain behaviour\nvaries from material to material. For example,\nrubber can be pulled to several times its original\nlength and still returns to its original shape.\nFig. 9.4 shows stress-strain curve for the elastic\ntissue of aorta, present in the heart. Note that\nalthough elastic region is very large, the material\n\nFig. 9.3 A typical stress-strain curve for a metal.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF SOLIDS 239\n\ndoes not obey Hooke’s law over most of the\nregion. Secondly, there is no well defined plastic\nregion. Substances like tissue of aorta, rubber\netc. which can be stretched to cause large strains\nare called elastomers.\n\n9.6  ELASTIC MODULI\n\nThe proportional region within the elastic limit\nof the stress-strain curve (region OA in Fig. 9.3)\nis of great importance for structural and\nmanufacturing engineering designs. The ratio\nof stress and strain, called modulus of elasticity,\nis found to be a characteristic of the material.\n\n9.6.1  Young’s Modulus\n\nExperimental observation show that for a given\nmaterial, the magnitude of the strain produced\nis same whether the stress is tensile or\ncompressive. The ratio of tensile (or compressive)\nstress (σ) to the longitudinal strain (ε) is defined as\nYoung’s modulus and is denoted by the symbol Y.\n\nY =\nσ\n\nε\n(9.7)\n\nFrom Eqs. (9.1) and (9.2), we have\n\nY = (F/A)/(∆L/L)\n   = (F × L) /(A × ∆L) (9.8)\n\nSince strain is a dimensionless quantity, the\nunit of Young’s modulus is the same as that of\nstress i.e., N m–2 or Pascal (Pa). Table 9.1 gives\nthe values of Young’s moduli and yield strengths\nof some material.\n\nFrom the data given in Table 9.1, it is noticed\nthat for metals Young’s moduli are large.\nTherefore, these materials require a large force\nto produce small change in length. To increase\nthe length of a thin steel wire of 0.1 cm2 cross-\nsectional area by 0.1%, a force of 2000 N is\nrequired. The force required to produce the same\nstrain in aluminium, brass and copper wires\nhaving the same cross-sectional area are 690 N,\n900 N and 1100 N respectively. It means that\nsteel is more elastic than copper, brass and\naluminium. It is for this reason that steel is\n\nFig. 9.4 Stress-strain curve for the elastic tissue of\nAorta, the large tube (vessel) carrying blood\n\nfrom the heart.\n\nTable 9.1 Young’s moduli and yield strenghs of some material\n\n# Substance tested under compression\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n240 PHYSICS\n\nu\n\nu\n\npreferred in heavy-duty machines and in\nstructural designs. Wood, bone, concrete and\nglass have rather small Young’s moduli.\n\nExample 9.1  A structural steel rod  has a\nradius of 10 mm and a length of 1.0 m. A\n100 kN force stretches it along its length.\nCalculate (a) stress, (b) elongation, and (c)\nstrain on the rod. Young’s modulus, of\nstructural steel is 2.0 × 1011 N m-2.\n\nAnswer We assume that the rod is held by a\nclamp at one end, and the force F is applied at\nthe other end, parallel to the length of the rod.\nThen the stress on the rod is given by\n\nStress\nF\n\nA\n=  =\n\nF\n\nrπ\n2\n\n        \n=\n\n× ( )\n×\n\n−\n\n100 10 N\n\n3.14 10 m\n\n3\n\n2\n2\n\n         = 3.18 × 108 N m–2\n\nThe elongation,\n\n( )F/A L\nL\n\nY\n∆ =\n\n    = \n( ) ( )×\n\n×\n\n8 –2\n\n11 –2\n\n1m3.18 10 N m\n\n2 10 N m\n\n    = 1.59 × 10–3 m\n    = 1.59 mm\n\nThe strain is given by\nStrain   = ∆L/L\n            = (1.59 × 10–3 m)/(1m)\n             = 1.59 × 10–3\n\n             = 0.16 % t\n\nExample 9.2 A copper wire of length 2.2\nm and a steel wire of length 1.6 m, both of\ndiameter 3.0 mm, are connected end to end.\nWhen stretched by a load, the net\nelongation is found to be 0.70 mm. Obtain\nthe load applied.\n\nAnswer The copper and steel wires are under\na tensile stress because they have the same\ntension (equal to the load W) and the same area\nof cross-section A. From Eq. (9.7) we have stress\n= strain × Young’s modulus. Therefore\n\nW/A = Y\nc\n × (∆L\n\nc\n/L\n\nc\n) = Y\n\ns\n × (∆L\n\ns\n/L\n\ns\n)\n\nwhere the subscripts c  and s refer to copper\nand stainless steel respectively.

Each\nthighbone (femur) of this performer has a\nlength of 50 cm and an effective radius of\n2.0 cm. Determine the amount by which\neach thighbone gets compressed under the\nextra load.\n\nFig. 9.5 Human pyramid in a circus.\n\nu\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF SOLIDS 241\n\nAnswer Total mass of all the performers, tables,\n\nplaques etc.     = 280 kg\nMass of the performer  = 60 kg\n\nMass supported by the legs of the performer\n\nat the bottom of the pyramid\n\n= 280 – 60 = 220 kg\n\nWeight of this supported mass\n\n = 220 kg wt. = 220 × 9.8 N = 2156 N.\nWeight supported by each thighbone of the\n\nperformer = ½ (2156) N = 1078 N.\n\nFrom Table 9.1, the Young’s modulus for bone\n\nis given by\n\nY = 9.4 × 109 N m–2.\n\nLength of each thighbone L = 0.5 m\nthe radius of thighbone = 2.0 cm\n\nThus the cross-sectional area of the thighbone\n\nA  = π × (2 × 10-2)2 m2 = 1.26 × 10-3 m2.\n\nUsing Eq. (9.8), the compression in each\n\nthighbone (∆L) can be computed as\n\n∆L = [(F × L)/(Y × A)]\n= [(1078 × 0.5)/(9.4 × 109 × 1.26 × 10-3)]\n\n= 4.55 × 10-5 m or 4.55 × 10-3 cm.\n\nThis is a very small change! The fractional\n\ndecrease in the thighbone is ∆L/L = 0.000091\n\nor 0.0091%. t\n\n9.6.2 Determination of Young’s Modulus of\nthe Material of a Wire\n\nA typical experimental arrangement to determine\n\nthe Young’s modulus of a material of wire under\ntension is shown in Fig. 9.6. It consists of two\nlong straight wires of same length and equal\n\nradius suspended side by side from a fixed rigid\nsupport. The wire A (called the reference wire)\n\ncarries a millimetre main scale M and a pan to\nplace a weight. The wire B (called the\nexperimental wire) of uniform area of cross-\n\nsection also carries a pan in which known\nweights can be placed. A vernier scale V is\n\nattached to a pointer at the bottom of the\nexperimental wire B, and the main scale M is\n\nfixed to the reference wire A. The weights placed\nin the pan exert a downward force and stretch\nthe experimental wire under a tensile stress. The\n\nelongation of the wire (increase in length) is\nmeasured by the vernier arrangement. The\n\nreference wire is used to compensate for any\nchange in length that may occur due to change\nin room temperature, since any change in length\n\nof the reference wire due to temperature change\n\nwill be accompanied by an equal change in\nexperimental wire. (We shall study  these\ntemperature effects in detail in Chapter 11.)\n\nFig. 9.6 An arrangement for the determination of\n\nYoung’s modulus of the material of a wire.\n\nBoth the reference and experimental wires are\n\ngiven an initial small load to keep the wires\nstraight and the vernier reading is noted. Now\n\nthe experimental wire is gradually loaded with\n\nmore weights to bring it under a tensile stress\n\nand the vernier reading is noted again. The\n\ndifference between two vernier readings gives\n\nthe elongation produced in the wire. Let r and L\nbe the initial radius and length of the\n\nexperimental wire, respectively. Then the area\n\nof cross-section of the wire would be πr2. Let M\n\nbe the mass that produced an elongation ∆L in\n\nthe wire. Thus the applied force is equal to Mg,\n\nwhere g is the acceleration due to gravity. From\nEq. (9.8), the Young’s modulus of the material\n\nof the experimental wire is given by\n\nY\nσ\n\nε\n=  = 2 .\n\nMg L\n\nLrπ ∆\n\n= Mg × L/(πr2 × ∆L) (9.9)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n242 PHYSICS\n\nu\n\n9.6.3 Shear Modulus\n\nThe ratio of shearing stress to the corresponding\n\nshearing strain is called the shear modulus of\n\nthe material and is represented by G. It is also\n\ncalled the modulus of rigidity.\n\nG  = shearing stress (σ\ns\n)/shearing strain\n\nG  = (F/A)/(∆x/L)\n\n    = (F × L)/(A × ∆x) (9.10)\n\nSimilarly, from Eq.

The area of the face parallel to which\nthis force is applied is\n\n A  = 50 cm × 10 cm\n\n                = 0.5 m × 0.1 m\n\n     = 0.05 m2\n\nTherefore, the stress applied is\n    = (9.4  × 104 N/0.05 m2)\n\n                         = 1.80 × 106 N.m–2\n\nFig. 9.7\n\nWe know that shearing strain = (∆x/L)= Stress /G.\n\nTherefore the displacement ∆x = (Stress × L)/G\n\n = (1.8 × 106 N m–2 × 0.5m)/(5.6 × 109 N m–2)\n\n = 1.6 × 10–4 m = 0.16 mm   t\n\n9.6.4  Bulk Modulus\n\nIn Section (9.3), we have seen that when a body\n\nis submerged in a fluid, it undergoes a hydraulic\n\nstress (equal in magnitude to the hydraulic\n\npressure). This leads to the decrease in the\n\nvolume of the body thus producing a strain called\n\nvolume strain [Eq. (9.5)]. The ratio of hydraulic\n\nstress to the corresponding hydraulic strain is\n\ncalled bulk modulus. It is denoted by symbol B.\n\nB = – p/(∆V/V) (9.13)\n\nThe negative sign indicates the fact that with\n\nan increase in pressure, a decrease in volume\n\noccurs. That is, if p is positive, ∆V is negative.\n\nThus for a system in equilibrium, the value of\n\nbulk modulus B is always positive. SI unit of\n\nbulk modulus is the same as that of pressure\n\ni.e., N m–2 or Pa. The bulk moduli of a few\n\ncommon materials are given in Table 9.3.\n\nThe reciprocal of the bulk modulus is called\n\ncompressibility and is denoted by k. It is defined\n\nas the fractional change in volume per unit\n\nincrease in pressure.\n\nk = (1/B) = – (1/∆p) × (∆V/V) (9.14)\n\nIt can be seen from the data given in Table\n\n9.3 that the bulk moduli for solids are much\n\nlarger than for liquids, which are again much\n\nlarger than the bulk modulus for gases (air).\n\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF SOLIDS 243\n\nu\n\nGases have large compressibilities, which vary\n\nwith pressure and temperature. The\n\nincompressibility of the solids is primarily due\n\nto the tight coupling between the neighbouring\n\natoms. The molecules in liquids are also bound\n\nwith their neighbours but not as strong as in\n\nsolids. Molecules in gases are very poorly\n\ncoupled to their neighbours.\n\nTable 9.4 shows the various types of stress,\n\nstrain, elastic moduli, and the applicable state\n\nof matter at a glance.\n\nExample 9.5 The average depth of Indian\nOcean is about 3000 m. Calculate the\nfractional compression, ∆V/V, of water at\nthe bottom of the ocean, given that the bulk\nmodulus of water is 2.2 ××××× 109 N m–2.

The strain\nperpendicular to the applied force is called\nlateral strain. Simon Poisson pointed out that\nwithin the elastic limit, lateral strain is directly\nproportional to the longitudinal strain. The ratio\nof the lateral strain to the longitudinal strain in\na stretched wire is called Poisson’s ratio. If the\noriginal diameter of the wire is d and the\ncontraction of the diameter under stress is ∆d,\nthe lateral strain is ∆d/d. If the original length\nof the wire is L and the elongation under stress\nis ∆L, the longitudinal strain is ∆L/L. Poisson’s\nratio is then (∆d/d)/(∆L/L) or (∆d/∆L) × (L/d).\nPoisson’s ratio is a ratio of two strains; it is a\npure number and has no dimensions or units.\nIts value depends only on the nature of material.\nFor steels the value is between 0.28 and 0.30,\nand for aluminium alloys it is about 0.33.\n\n9.6.6 Elastic Potential Energy\nin a Stretched Wire\n\nWhen a wire is put under a tensile stress, work\nis done against the inter-atomic forces. This\nwork is stored in the wire in the form of elastic\npotential energy. When a wire of original length\nL and area of cross-section A is subjected to a\ndeforming force F along the length of the wire,\nlet the length of the wire be elongated by l. Then\nfrom Eq. (9.8), we have F = YA × (l/L). Here Y is\nthe Young’s modulus of the material of the wire.\nNow for a further elongation of infinitesimal\nsmall length dl, work done dW is F × dl or YAldl/\nL. Therefore, the amount of work done (W) in\nincreasing the length of the wire from L to L + l,\nthat is from l = 0 to l = l is\n\n      W = = ×∫\n0\n\n2\n\n2\n\nl YAl YA l\ndl\n\nL L\n\n      W = \n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\n× × ×\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ed \uf8f8\n\n2\n1\n\n2\n\nl\nY AL\n\nL\n\n= \n1\n\n2\n×  Young’s modulus × strain2 ×\n\n         volume of the wire\n\n= \n1\n\n2\n×  stress × strain × volume of the\n\n          wire\n\nThis work is stored in the wire in the form of\n\nelastic potential energy (U). Therefore the elastic\n\npotential energy per unit volume of the wire (u) is\n\n       u = \n1\n\n2\n× σ ε (9.15)\n\n9.7 APPLICATIONS OF ELASTIC\nBEHAVIOUR OF MATERIALS\n\nThe elastic behaviour of materials plays an\nimportant role in everyday life. All engineering\ndesigns require precise knowledge of the elastic\nbehaviour of materials. For example while\ndesigning a building, the structural design of\nthe columns, beams and supports require\nknowledge of strength of materials used. Have\nyou ever thought why the beams used in\nconstruction of bridges, as supports etc. have\na cross-section of the type I? Why does a heap\nof sand or a hill have a pyramidal shape?\nAnswers to these questions can be obtained\nfrom the study of structural engineering which\nis based on concepts developed here.\n\nCranes used for lifting and moving heavy\nloads from one place to another have a thick\nmetal rope to which the load is attached. The\nrope is pulled up using pulleys and motors.\nSuppose we want to make a crane, which has\na lifting capacity of 10 tonnes or metric tons (1\nmetric ton = 1000 kg). How thick should the\nsteel rope be? We obviously want that the load\ndoes not deform the rope permanently.\nTherefore, the extension should not exceed the\nelastic limit. From Table 9.1, we find that mild\nsteel has a yield strength (σ\n\ny\n) of about 300 ×\n\n106 N m–2. Thus, the area of cross-section (A)\nof the rope should at least be\n\nA ≥ W/σy  =  Mg/σy (9.16)\n\n=  (104 kg × 9.8 m s-2)/(300 × 106 N m-2)\n=  3.3 × 10-4 m2\n\ncorresponding to a radius of about 1 cm for\na rope of circular cross-section. Generally\na large margin of safety (of about a factor of\nten in the load) is provided. Thus a thicker\nrope of radius about 3 cm is recommended.\nA single wire of this radius would practically\nbe a rigid rod. So the ropes are always made\nof a number of thin wires braided together,\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF SOLIDS 245\n\nlike in pigtails, for ease in manufacture,\nflexibility and strength.\n\nA bridge has to be designed such that it can\nwithstand the load of the flowing traffic, the force\nof winds and its own weight. Similarly, in the\ndesign of buildings the use of beams and columns\nis very common. In both the cases, the\novercoming of the problem of bending of beam\nunder a load is of prime importance. The beam\nshould not bend too much or break. Let us\nconsider the case of a beam loaded at the centre\nand supported near its ends as shown in\nFig. 9.8.  A bar of length l, breadth b, and depth d\nwhen loaded at the centre by a load W sags by\nan amount given by\n\nδ = W l3/(4bd 3Y) (9.17)\n\nFig. 9.8 A beam supported at the ends and loaded\n\nat the centre.\n\nThis relation can be derived using what you\n\nhave already learnt and a little calculus. From\n\nEq. (9.16), we see that to reduce the bending\n\nfor a given load, one should use a material with\n\na large Young’s modulus Y. For a given material,\n\nincreasing the depth d rather than the breadth\n\nb is more effective in reducing the bending, since\n\nδ  is proportional to d -3 and only to b-1(of course\n\nthe length l of the span should be as small as\n\npossible). But on increasing the depth, unless\n\nthe load is exactly at the right place (difficult to\n\narrange in a bridge with moving traffic), the\n\ndeep bar  may bend as shown in Fig. 9.9(b). This\n\nis called buckling. To avoid this, a common\n\ncompromise is the cross-sectional shape shown\n\nin Fig. 9.9(c). This section provides a large load-\n\nbearing surface and enough depth to prevent\n\nbending. This shape reduces the weight of the\n\nbeam without sacrificing the strength and\n\nhence reduces the cost.\n\n(a) (b) (c)\n\nFig. 9.9 Different cross-sectional shapes of a beam.\n(a) Rectangular section of a bar;\n\n(b) A thin bar and how it can buckle;\n\n(c) Commonly used section for a load\n\nbearing bar.\n\nThe use of pillars or columns is also very\ncommon in buildings and bridges. A pillar with\nrounded ends as shown in Fig. 9.10(a) supports\nless load than that with a distributed shape at\nthe ends [Fig. 9.10(b)]. The precise design of a\nbridge or a building has to take into account\nthe conditions under which it will function, the\ncost and long period, reliability of usable\nmaterial, etc.\n\n                    (a)                         (b)\n\nFig. 9.10 Pillars or columns: (a) a pillar with rounded\n\nends, (b) Pillar with distributed ends.\n\nThe answer to the question why the maximum\nheight of a mountain on earth is ~10 km can\nalso be provided by considering the elastic\nproperties of rocks. A mountain base is not under\nuniform compression and this provides some\nshearing stress to the rocks under which they\ncan flow. The stress due to all the material on\nthe top should be less than the critical shearing\nstress at which the rocks flow.\n\nAt the bottom of a mountain of height h, the\nforce per unit area due to the weight of the\nmountain is hρg where ρ is the density of the\nmaterial of the mountain and g is the acceleration\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n246 PHYSICS\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. Stress is the restoring force per unit area and strain is the fractional change in dimension.\nIn general there are three types of stresses (a) tensile stress — longitudinal stress\n(associated with stretching) or compressive stress (associated with compression),\n(b) shearing stress, and (c) hydraulic stress.\n\n2. For small deformations, stress is directly proportional to the strain for many materials.\nThis is known as Hooke’s law. The constant of proportionality is called modulus of\nelasticity. Three elastic moduli viz., Young’s modulus, shear modulus and bulk modulus\nare used to describe the elastic behaviour of objects as they respond to deforming forces\nthat act on them.\nA class of solids called elastomers does not obey Hooke’s law.\n\n3. When an object is under tension or compression, the Hooke’s law takes the form\n F/A  = Y∆L/L\n\nwhere  ∆L/L is the tensile or compressive strain of the object, F is the magnitude of the\napplied force causing the strain, A is the cross-sectional area over which F is applied\n(perpendicular to A) and Y is the Young’s modulus for the object. The stress is F/A.\n\n4. A pair of forces when applied parallel to the upper and lower faces, the solid deforms so\nthat the upper face moves sideways with respect to the lower. The horizontal displacement\n∆L of the upper face is perpendicular to the vertical height L. This type of deformation is\ncalled shear and the corresponding stress is the shearing stress. This type of stress is\npossible only in solids.\nIn this kind of deformation the Hooke’s law takes the form\n\nF/A = G × ∆L/L\nwhere ∆L is the displacement of one end of object in the direction of the applied force F,\nand G is the shear modulus.\n\n5. When an object undergoes hydraulic compression due to a stress exerted by a surrounding\nfluid, the Hooke’s law takes the form\n\np = B (∆V/V),\nwhere p is the pressure (hydraulic stress) on the object due to the fluid, ∆V/V  (the\nvolume strain) is the absolute fractional change in the object’s volume due to that\n\npressure and B is the bulk modulus of the object.\n\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n\n1. In the case of a wire, suspended from celing and stretched under the action of a weight (F)\n\nsuspended from its other end, the force exerted by the ceiling on it is  equal and opposite\n\nto the weight. However, the tension at any cross-section A of the wire is just F and not\n\n2F. Hence, tensile stress which is equal to the tension per unit area is equal to F/A.\n\n2. Hooke’s law is valid only in the linear part of stress-strain curve.\n\n3. The Young’s modulus and shear modulus are relevant only for solids since only solids\n\nhave lengths and shapes.\n\n4. Bulk modulus is relevant for solids, liquid and gases.  It refers to the change in volume\n\nwhen every part of the body is under the uniform stress so that the shape of the body\n\nremains unchanged.\n\ndue to gravity. The material at the bottom\nexperiences this force in the vertical direction,\nand the sides of the mountain are free. Therefore,\nthis is not a case of pressure or bulk compression.\nThere is a shear component, approximately hρg\nitself. Now the elastic limit for a typical rock is\n\n30 × 107 N m-2. Equating this to hρg, with\nρ  = 3 × 103 kg m-3 gives\n\nhρg  = 30 × 107 N m-2 .\nh      =  30 × 107 N m-2/(3 × 103 kg m-3 × 10 m s-2)\n      = 10 km\n\nwhich is more than the height of Mt. Everest!\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF SOLIDS 247\n\n5. Metals have larger values of Young’s modulus than alloys and elastomers. A material\n\nwith large value of Young’s modulus requires a large force to produce small changes in\n\nits length.\n\n6. In daily life, we feel that a material which stretches more is more elastic, but it a is\n\nmisnomer. In fact material which stretches to a lesser extent for a given load is considered\n\nto be more elastic.\n\n7. In general, a deforming force in one direction can produce strains in other directions\n\nalso. The proportionality between stress and strain in such situations cannot be described\n\nby just one elastic constant.  For example, for a wire under longitudinal strain, the\n\nlateral dimensions (radius of cross section) will undergo a small change, which is described\n\nby another elastic constant of the material (called Poisson ratio).\n\n8. Stress is not a vector quantity since, unlike a force, the stress cannot be assigned a\n\nspecific direction. Force acting on the portion of a body on a specified side of a section\n\nhas a definite direction.\n\nEXERCISES\n\n9.1 A steel wire of length 4.7 m and cross-sectional area 3.0 × 10-5 m2 stretches by the same\namount as a copper wire of length 3.5 m and cross-sectional area of 4.0 × 10–5 m2 under\na given load.
