We saw that\nuniform motion needs the concept of velocity alone whereas\nnon-uniform motion requires the concept of acceleration in\naddition.  So far, we have not asked the question as to what\ngoverns the motion of bodies. In this chapter, we turn to this\nbasic question.\n\nLet us first guess the answer based on our common\nexperience. To move a football at rest, someone must kick it.\nTo throw a stone upwards, one has to  give it an upward\npush.  A breeze causes the branches of a tree to swing; a\nstrong wind can even move heavy objects. A boat moves in a\nflowing river without anyone rowing it. Clearly, some external\nagency is needed to provide force to move a body from rest.\nLikewise, an external force is needed also to retard or stop\nmotion.  You can stop a ball rolling down an inclined plane by\napplying a force against the direction of its motion.\n\nIn these examples, the external agency of force (hands,\nwind, stream, etc) is in contact with the object. This is not\nalways necessary. A stone released from the top of a building\naccelerates downward due to the gravitational pull of the\nearth.  A bar magnet can attract an iron nail from a distance.\nThis shows that external agencies (e.g. gravitational and\nmagnetic forces )  can exert  force on a body even from a\ndistance.\n\nIn short, a force is required to put a stationary body in\nmotion or stop a moving body, and some external agency is\nneeded to provide this force. The external agency may or may\nnot be in contact with the body.\n\nSo far so good. But what if a body is moving uniformly (e.g.\na skater moving straight with constant speed on a horizontal\nice slab) ?  Is an external force required to keep a body in\nuniform motion?\n\n5.1 Introduction\n\n5.2 Aristotle’s fallacy\n\n5.3 The law of inertia\n\n5.4 Newton’s first law of motion\n\n5.5 Newton’s second law of\nmotion\n\n5.6 Newton’s third law of motion\n\n5.7 Conservation of momentum\n\n5.8 Equilibrium of a particle\n\n5.9 Common forces in mechanics\n\n5.10 Circular motion\n\n5.11 Solving problems in\nmechanics\n\nSummary\n\nPoints to ponder\n\nExercises\n\nAdditional exercises\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS90\n\n5.2  ARISTOTLE’S  FALLACY\n\nThe question posed above appears to be simple.\nHowever, it took ages to answer it. Indeed, the\ncorrect answer to this question given by Galileo\nin the seventeenth century was the foundation\nof Newtonian mechanics, which signalled the\nbirth of modern science.\n\nThe Greek thinker,  Aristotle (384 B.C– 322\nB.C.), held the view that if a body is moving,\nsomething external is required to keep it moving.\nAccording to this view, for example, an arrow\nshot from a bow keeps flying since the air behind\nthe arrow keeps pushing it. The view was part of\nan elaborate framework of ideas developed by\nAristotle on the motion of bodies in the universe.\nMost of the Aristotelian ideas on motion are now\nknown to be wrong and need not concern us.\nFor our purpose here, the Aristotelian law of\nmotion may be phrased thus: An external force\nis required  to keep a body in motion.\n\nAristotelian law of motion is flawed, as we shall\nsee.  However, it is a natural view that anyone\nwould hold from common experience. Even a\nsmall child playing with a simple (non-electric)\ntoy-car on a floor knows intuitively that it needs\nto constantly drag the string attached to the toy-\ncar with some force to keep it going.  If it releases\nthe string, it comes to rest. This experience is\ncommon to most terrestrial motion. External\nforces seem to be needed to keep bodies in\nmotion. Left to themselves, all bodies eventually\ncome to rest.\n\nWhat is the flaw in Aristotle’s argument? The\nanswer is: a moving toy car comes to rest because\nthe external force of friction on the car by the floor\nopposes its motion. To counter this force, the child\nhas to apply an external force on the car in the\ndirection of motion.  When the car is in uniform\nmotion, there is no net external force acting on it:\nthe force by the child cancels the force ( friction)\nby the floor.  The corollary is: if there were no friction,\nthe child would not be required to apply any force\nto keep the toy car in uniform motion.\n\nThe opposing forces such as friction (solids)\nand viscous forces (for fluids) are always present\nin the natural world.  This explains why forces\nby external agencies are necessary to overcome\nthe frictional forces to keep bodies in uniform\nmotion. Now we understand  where Aristotle\nwent wrong.  He coded this practical experience\nin the form of a basic argument.  To get at the\n\ntrue law of nature for forces and motion, one has\nto imagine a world in which uniform motion is\npossible with no frictional forces opposing. This\nis what Galileo did.\n\n5.3  THE LAW OF INERTIA\n\nGalileo studied motion of objects on an inclined\nplane.  Objects (i) moving down an inclined plane\naccelerate, while those (ii) moving up retard.\n(iii )  Motion on a horizontal plane  is an\nintermediate situation.  Galileo concluded that\nan object moving on a frictionless horizontal\nplane must neither have acceleration nor\nretardation, i.e. it should move with constant\nvelocity (Fig. 5.1(a)).\n\n(i) (ii) (iii)\nFig. 5.1(a)\n\nAnother experiment by Galileo leading to the\nsame conclusion involves a double inclined plane.\nA ball released from rest on one of the planes rolls\ndown and climbs up the other. If the planes are\nsmooth, the final height of the ball is nearly the\nsame as the initial height (a little less but never\ngreater). In the ideal situation, when friction is\nabsent, the final height of the ball is the same\nas its initial height.\n\nIf the slope of the second plane is decreased\nand the experiment repeated, the ball will still\nreach the same height, but in doing so, it will\ntravel a longer distance.  In the limiting case, when\nthe slope of the second plane is zero (i.e. is a\nhorizontal) the ball travels an infinite distance.\nIn other words, its motion never ceases. This is,\nof course, an idealised situation (Fig. 5.1(b)).\n\nFig. 5.1(b) The law of inertia was inferred by Galileo\nfrom observations of motion of a ball on a\n\ndouble inclined plane.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nLAWS OF MOTION 91\n\nIn practice, the ball does come to a stop after\nmoving a finite distance on the horizontal plane,\nbecause of the opposing force of friction which\ncan never be totally eliminated.  However, if there\nwere no friction, the ball would continue  to move\nwith a constant velocity on the horizontal plane.\n\nGalileo thus, arrived at a new insight on\nmotion that had eluded Aristotle and those who\nfollowed him.  The state of rest and the state of\nuniform linear motion (motion with constant\nvelocity) are equivalent. In both cases, there is\n\nno net force acting on the body.  It is incorrect to\nassume that a net force is needed to keep a body\nin uniform motion. To maintain a body in\nuniform motion, we need to apply an external\nforce to ecounter the frictional force, so that\nthe two forces sum up to zero net external\nforce.\n\nTo summarise, if the net external force is zero,\na body at rest continues to remain at rest and a\nbody in motion continues to move with a uniform\nvelocity.  This property of the body is called\ninertia. Inertia means ‘resistance to  change’.\nA body does not change its state of rest or\nuniform motion, unless an external force\ncompels it to change that state.\n\n5.4  NEWTON’S FIRST LAW OF MOTION\n\nGalileo’s simple, but revolutionary ideas\ndethroned Aristotelian mechanics. A new\nmechanics had to be developed. This task was\n\nIdeas on Motion in Ancient Indian Science\n\nAncient Indian thinkers had arrived at an elaborate system of ideas on motion. Force, the cause of\nmotion, was thought to be of different kinds : force due to continuous pressure (nodan), as the force\nof wind on a sailing vessel; impact (abhighat), as when a potter’s rod strikes the wheel; persistent\ntendency (sanskara) to move in a straight line(vega) or restoration of shape in an elastic body;\ntransmitted force by a string, rod, etc. The notion of (vega) in the Vaisesika theory of motion perhaps\ncomes closest to the concept of inertia.  Vega, the tendency to move in a straight line, was thought to\nbe opposed by contact with objects including atmosphere, a parallel to the ideas of friction and air\nresistance.  It was correctly summarised that the different kinds of motion (translational, rotational\nand vibrational) of an extended body arise from only the translational motion of its constituent\nparticles. A falling leaf in the wind may have downward motion as a whole (patan) and also rotational\nand vibrational motion (bhraman, spandan), but each particle of the leaf at an instant only has a\ndefinite (small) displacement. There was considerable focus in Indian thought on measurement of\nmotion and units of length and time.  It was known that the position of a particle in space can be\nindicated by distance measured along three axes.  Bhaskara (1150 A.D.) had introduced the concept\nof ‘instantaneous motion’ (tatkaliki gati), which anticipated the modern notion of instantaneous\nvelocity using Differential Calculus. The difference between a wave and a current (of water) was clearly\nunderstood; a current is a motion of particles of water under gravity and fluidity while a wave results\nfrom the transmission of vibrations of water particles.\n\naccomplished almost single-handedly by Isaac\nNewton, one of the greatest scientists of all times.\n\nNewton built on Galileo’s ideas and laid the\nfoundation of mechanics in terms of three laws\nof  motion that go by his name.  Galileo’s law of\ninertia was his starting point which he\nformulated as the first law of motion:\n\nEvery body continues to be in its state\nof rest or of uniform motion in a straight\nline unless compelled by some external\nforce to act otherwise.\n\nThe state of rest or uniform linear motion both\nimply zero acceleration. The first law of motion  can,\ntherefore, be simply expressed as:\nIf the net external force on a body is zero, its\nacceleration is zero.  Acceleration can be non\nzero only if there is a net external force on\nthe body.\n\nTwo kinds of situations are encountered in the\n\napplication of this law in practice. In some\n\nexamples, we know that the net external force\n\non the object is zero. In that case we can\n\nconclude that the acceleration of the object is\n\nzero.  For example, a spaceship out in\n\ninterstellar space, far from all other objects and\n\nwith all its rockets turned off, has no net\n\nexternal force acting on it.  Its acceleration,\n\naccording to the first law, must be zero.  If it is\n\nin motion, it must continue to move with a\n\nuniform velocity.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS92\n\nMore often, however, we do not know all the\n\nforces to begin with.  In that case, if we know\n\nthat an object is unaccelerated (i.e. it is either\n\nat rest or in uniform linear motion), we can infer\n\nfrom the first law that the net external force on\n\nthe object must be zero. Gravity is everywhere.\n\nFor terrestrial phenomena, in particular, every\n\nobject experiences gravitational force due to the\n\nearth.  Also objects in motion generally experience\n\nfriction, viscous drag, etc. If then, on earth, an\n\nobject is at rest or in uniform linear motion, it is\n\nnot because there are no forces acting on it, but\n\nbecause the various external forces cancel out\n\ni.e. add up to zero net external force.\nConsider a book at rest on a horizontal surface\n\nFig. (5.2(a)).  It is subject to two external forces :\nthe force due to gravity (i.e. its weight W) acting\ndownward and the upward force on the book by\nthe table, the normal force R . R is a self-adjusting\nforce. This is an example of the kind of situation\nmentioned above. The forces are not quite known\nfully but the state of motion is known. We observe\nthe book to be at rest.  Therefore, we conclude\nfrom the first law that the magnitude of R equals\nthat of W. A statement often encountered is :\n“Since W = R, forces cancel and, therefore, the book\nis at rest”. This is incorrect reasoning. The correct\nstatement is : “Since the book is observed to be at\nrest, the net external force on it must be zero,\naccording to the first law. This implies that the\n\nGalileo Galilei, born in Pisa, Italy in 1564 was a key figure in the scientific revolution\nin Europe about four centuries ago.  Galileo proposed the concept of acceleration.\nFrom experiments on motion of bodies on inclined planes or falling freely, he\ncontradicted the Aristotelian notion that a force was required to keep a body in\nmotion, and that heavier bodies fall faster than lighter bodies under gravity.  He\nthus arrived at the law of inertia that was the starting point of the subsequent\nepochal work of Isaac Newton.\n\nGalileo’s discoveries in astronomy were equally revolutionary.  In 1609, he designed\nhis own telescope (invented earlier in Holland) and used it to make a number of\nstartling  observations :  mountains  and depressions on  the  surface of the moon;\ndark spots on the sun; the moons of Jupiter and the phases of Venus.  He concluded\nthat the Milky Way derived its luminosity because of a large number of stars not visible to the naked eye.\nIn his masterpiece of scientific reasoning : Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems, Galileo advocated\nthe heliocentric theory of the solar system proposed by Copernicus, which eventually got universal\nacceptance.\n\nWith Galileo came a turning point in the very method of scientific inquiry. Science was no longer\nmerely observations of nature and inferences from them. Science meant devising and doing experiments\nto verify or refute theories. Science meant measurement of quantities and a search for mathematical\n\nrelations between them. Not undeservedly, many regard Galileo as the father of modern science.\n\nnormal force R  must be equal and opposite to the\nweight W ”.\n\nFig. 5.2 (a) a book at rest on the table, and (b) a car\nmoving with uniform velocity. The net force\n\nis zero in each case.\n\nConsider the motion of a car starting from\n\nrest, picking up speed and then moving on a\n\nsmooth straight road with uniform speed (Fig.\n\n(5.2(b)).  When the car is stationary, there is no\n\nnet force acting on it. During pick-up, it\n\naccelerates. This must happen due to a net\n\nexternal force. Note, it has to be an external force.\n\nThe acceleration of the car cannot be accounted\n\nfor by any internal force.  This might sound\n\nsurprising, but it is true.  The only conceivable\n\nexternal force along the road is the force of\n\nfriction.  It is the frictional force that accelerates\n\nthe car as a whole.  (You will learn about friction\n\nin section 5.9).  When the car moves with\n\nconstant velocity, there is no net external force.\n\nGalileo Galilei (1564 - 1642)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nLAWS OF MOTION 93\n\n\uf074\n\nIt relates the net external force to the\nacceleration of the body.\n\nMomentum\nMomentum of a body is defined to be the product\nof its mass m and velocity v, and is denoted\nby p:\n\np = m v             (5.1)\n\nMomentum is clearly a vector quantity.  The\nfollowing common experiences indicate the\nimportance of this quantity for considering the\neffect of force on motion.\n\n• Suppose a light-weight vehicle (say a small\n\ncar) and a heavy weight vehicle (say a loaded\ntruck) are parked on a horizontal road. We all\nknow that a much greater force is needed to\npush the truck than the car to bring them to\nthe same speed in same time.  Similarly, a\ngreater opposing force is needed to stop a\nheavy body than a light body in the same time,\nif they are moving with the same speed.\n\n• If two stones, one light and the other heavy,\n\nare dropped from the top of a building, a\nperson on the ground will find it easier to catch\nthe light stone than the heavy stone.  The\nmass of a body is thus an important\nparameter that determines the effect of force\non its motion.\n\n• Speed is another important parameter to\nconsider. A bullet fired by a gun can easily\npierce human tissue before it stops, resulting\nin casualty.  The same bullet fired with\nmoderate speed will not cause much damage.\nThus for a given mass, the greater the speed,\nthe greater is the opposing force needed to stop\nthe body in a certain time.  Taken together,\nthe product of mass and velocity, that is\nmomentum, is evidently a relevant variable\nof motion. The greater the change in the\nmomentum in a given time, the greater is the\nforce that needs to be applied.\n\n• A seasoned cricketer catches a cricket ball\ncoming in with great speed far more easily\nthan a novice, who can hurt his hands in the\nact.  One reason is that the cricketer allows a\nlonger time for his hands to stop the ball.  As\nyou may have noticed, he draws in the hands\nbackward in the act of catching the ball (Fig.\n5.3).  The novice, on the other hand, keeps\nhis hands fixed and tries to catch the ball\nalmost instantly. He needs to provide a much\ngreater force to stop the ball instantly, and\n\nThe property of inertia contained in the First\n\nlaw is evident in many situations.  Suppose we\nare standing in a stationary  bus and the driver\n\nstarts the bus suddenly. We get thrown\nbackward with a jerk. Why ? Our feet are in touch\nwith the floor. If there were no friction, we would\n\nremain where we were, while the floor of the bus\nwould simply slip forward under our feet and the\n\nback of the bus would hit us.  However,\nfortunately, there is some friction between the\n\nfeet and the floor.  If the start is not too sudden,\ni.e. if the acceleration is moderate, the frictional\nforce would be enough to accelerate our feet\n\nalong with the bus.  But our body is not strictly\na rigid body. It is deformable, i.e. it allows some\n\nrelative displacement between different parts.\nWhat this means is that while our feet go with\nthe bus, the rest of the body remains where it is\n\ndue to inertia.  Relative to the bus, therefore, we\nare thrown backward.  As soon as that happens,\n\nhowever, the muscular forces on the rest of the\nbody (by the feet) come into play to move the body\n\nalong with the bus. A similar thing happens\nwhen the bus suddenly stops.  Our feet stop due\nto the friction which does not allow relative\n\nmotion between the feet and the floor of the bus.\nBut the rest of the body continues to move\n\nforward due to inertia.  We are thrown forward.\nThe restoring muscular forces again come into\nplay and bring the body to rest.\n\nExample 5.1  An astronaut accidentally\ngets separated out of his small spaceship\naccelerating in inter stellar space at a\nconstant rate of 100 m s–2.  What is the\nacceleration of the astronaut the instant after\nhe is outside the spaceship ? (Assume that\nthere are no nearby stars to exert\ngravitational force on him.)\n\nAnswer  Since there are no nearby stars to exert\ngravitational force on him and the small\nspaceship exerts negligible gravitational\nattraction on him, the net force acting on the\nastronaut, once he is out of the spaceship, is\nzero. By the first law of motion the acceleration\nof the astronaut is zero.\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf074\n\n5.5  NEWTON’S SECOND LAW OF MOTION\n\nThe first law refers to the simple case when the\nnet external force on a body is zero.  The second\nlaw of motion refers to the general situation when\nthere is a net external force acting on the body.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS94\n\nthis hurts. The conclusion is clear: force not\nonly depends on the change in momentum,\nbut also on how fast the change is brought\nabout.  The same change in momentum\nbrought about in a shorter time needs a\ngreater applied force. In short, the greater the\nrate of change of momentum, the greater is\nthe force.\n\nFig. 5.3 Force not only depends on the change in\nmomentum but also on how fast the change\n\nis brought about. A seasoned cricketer draws\n\nin his hands during a catch, allowing greater\n\ntime for the ball to stop and hence requires a\n\nsmaller force.\n\n• Observations confirm that the product of\n\nmass and velocity (i.e. momentum) is basic to\n\nthe effect of force on motion.  Suppose a fixed\n\nforce is applied for a certain interval of time\n\non two bodies of different masses, initially at\n\nrest,  the lighter body picks up a greater speed\n\nthan the heavier body.  However, at the end of\n\nthe time interval, observations show that each\n\nbody acquires the same momentum.  Thus\n\nthe same force for the same time causes\n\nthe same change in momentum for\n\ndifferent bodies.  This is a crucial clue to the\n\nsecond law of motion.\n\n• In the preceding observations, the vector\n\ncharacter of momentum has not been evident.\n\nIn the examples so far, momentum and change\n\nin momentum both have the same direction.\n\nBut this is not always the case.  Suppose a\n\nstone is rotated with uniform speed in a\n\nhorizontal plane by means of a string, the\n\nmagnitude of momentum is fixed, but its\n\ndirection changes (Fig. 5.4). A force is needed\n\nto cause this change in momentum vector.\n\nThis force is provided by our hand through\nthe string.  Experience suggests that our hand\nneeds to exert a greater force if the stone is\nrotated at greater speed or in a circle of\nsmaller radius, or both. This corresponds to\ngreater acceleration or equivalently a greater\nrate of change in momentum vector. This\nsuggests that the greater the rate of change\nin momentum vector the greater is the force\napplied.\n\nFig. 5.4 Force is necessary  for changing the direction\nof momentum, even if its magnitude is\n\nconstant. We can feel this while rotating a\n\nstone in a horizontal circle with uniform speed\n\nby means of a string.\n\nThese qualitative observations lead to the\nsecond law of motion expressed by Newton as\nfollows :\n\nThe rate of change of momentum of a body is\ndirectly proportional to the applied force and\ntakes place in the direction in which the force\nacts.\n\nThus, if under the action of a force F for time\ninterval ∆t, the velocity of a body of mass m\nchanges from v to v + ∆v i.e. its initial momentum\n\np = m v changes by m∆ = ∆p v . According to the\n\nSecond Law,\n\n            or     k\nt t\n\n∆ ∆\n∝ =\n\n∆ ∆\n\np p\nF F\n\nwhere k  is a constant of proportionality.  Taking\n\nthe limit ∆t → 0,  the term \nt∆\n\n∆p\n becomes the\n\nderivative or differential co-efficient of p with\n\nrespect to t, denoted by \nd\n\ndt\n\np\n.  Thus\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nLAWS OF MOTION 95\n\n\uf074\n\n    \nd\n\nd\nk\n\nt\n=\n\np\nF (5.2)\n\nFor a body of fixed mass m,\n\n   ( )\nd d d\n\nd d d\nm m m \n\nt t t\n= = =\n\np v\nv a      (5.3)\n\ni.e the Second Law can also be written as\n             F  =   k m a         (5.4)\n\nwhich shows that force is proportional to the\n\nproduct of mass m and acceleration a.\n\nThe unit of force has not been defined so far.\n\nIn fact, we use Eq.

The\n\nsecond law is obviously  consistent with the\n\nfirst law.\n\n2. The second law of motion is a vector law.

The\ncomponent of velocity normal to the force\nremains unchanged. For example, in the\nmotion of a projectile under the vertical\ngravitational force, the horizontal component\nof velocity remains unchanged (Fig. 5.5).\n\n3. The second law of motion given by Eq. (5.5) is\napplicable to a single point particle. The force\n\nF in the law stands for the net external force\n\non the particle and a stands for acceleration\n\nof the particle. It turns out, however, that the\n\nlaw in the same form applies to a rigid body or,\n\neven more generally, to a system of particles.\n\nIn that case, F refers to the total external force\n\non the system and a refers to the acceleration\n\nof the system as a whole.  More precisely, a is\n\nthe acceleration of the centre of mass of the\n\nsystem about which we shall study in detail in\n\nchapter 7. Any internal forces in the system\n\nare not to be included in F.\n\nFig. 5.5 Acceleration at an instant is determined by\nthe force at that instant. The moment after a\n\nstone is dropped out of an accelerated train,\n\nit has no horizontal acceleration or force, if\n\nair resistance is neglected. The stone carries\n\nno memory of its acceleration with the train\n\na moment ago.\n\n4. The second law of motion is a local relation\n\nwhich means that force F at a point in space\n\n(location of the particle) at a certain instant\n\nof time is related to a at that point at that\n\ninstant. Acceleration here and now is\n\ndetermined by the force here and now, not by\n\nany history of the motion of the particle\n\n(See Fig. 5.5).\n\nExample 5.2  A bullet of mass 0.04 kg\n\nmoving with a speed of 90 m s–1 enters a\n\nheavy wooden block and is stopped after a\n\ndistance of 60 cm.

The\nanswer therefore, only indicates the average\nresistive force.     \uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf074\n\nExample 5.3  The motion of a particle of\n\nmass m is described by y = +\n21\n\n2\nut gt .

For\nexample, when a ball hits a wall and bounces\nback, the force on the ball by the wall acts for a\nvery short time when the two are in contact, yet\nthe force is large enough to reverse the momentum\nof the ball. Often, in these situations, the force\nand the time duration are difficult to ascertain\nseparately. However, the product of force and time,\nwhich is the change in momentum of the body\nremains a measurable quantity. This product is\ncalled impulse:\n\nImpulse  =  Force × time duration\n          =  Change in momentum        (5.7)\n\nA large force acting for a short time to produce a\nfinite change in momentum is called an impulsive\nforce. In the history of science, impulsive forces\nwere put in a conceptually different category from\n\nordinary forces.  Newtonian mechanics has no\nsuch distinction.  Impulsive force is like any other\nforce – except that it is large and acts for a short\ntime.\n\nExample 5.4  A batsman hits back a ball\nstraight in the direction of the bowler without\nchanging its initial speed of 12 m s–1.\nIf the mass of the ball is 0.15 kg, determine\nthe impulse imparted to the ball.  (Assume\nlinear motion of the ball)\n\nAnswer   Change in momentum\n       =  0.15 × 12–(–0.15×12)\n\n      =  3.6 N s,\n\nImpulse  =  3.6 N s,\nin the direction from the batsman to the bowler.\n\nThis is an example where the force on the ball\nby the batsman and the time of contact of the\nball and the bat are difficult to know, but the\nimpulse is readily calculated.\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf074\n\n5.6  NEWTON’S THIRD LAW OF MOTION\n\nThe second law relates the external force on a\n\nbody to its acceleration. What is the origin of the\n\nexternal force on the body ?  What agency\n\nprovides the external force ?  The simple answer\n\nin Newtonian mechanics is that the external\n\nforce on a body always arises due to some other\n\nbody.  Consider a pair of bodies A and B. B gives\n\nrise to an external force on A.  A natural question\n\nis: Does A in turn give rise to an external force\n\non B ?  In some examples, the answer seems\n\nclear.  If you press a coiled spring, the spring is\n\ncompressed by the force of your hand.  The\n\ncompressed spring in turn exerts a force on your\n\nhand and you can feel it.  But what if the bodies\n\nare not in contact ?  The earth pulls a stone\n\ndownwards due to gravity.  Does the stone exert\n\na force on the earth ?  The answer is not obvious\n\nsince we hardly see the effect of the stone on the\n\nearth. The answer according to Newton is: Yes,\n\nthe stone does exert an equal and opposite force\n\non the earth. We do not notice it since the earth\n\nis very massive and the effect of a small force on\n\nits motion is negligible.\n\nThus, according to Newtonian mechanics,\n\nforce never occurs singly in nature. Force is the\n\nmutual interaction between two bodies.  Forces\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nLAWS OF MOTION 97\n\nalways occur in pairs. Further, the mutual forces\n\nbetween two bodies are always equal and\nopposite.  This idea was expressed by Newton in\nthe form of the third law of motion.\n\nTo every action, there is always an equal and\nopposite reaction.\n\nNewton’s wording of the third law is so crisp and\nbeautiful that it has become a part of common\nlanguage. For the same reason perhaps,\nmisconceptions about the third law abound.  Let\nus note some important points about the third\nlaw, particularly in regard to the usage of the\nterms : action and reaction.\n1. The terms action and reaction in the third law\n\nmean nothing else but ‘force’. Using different\nterms for the same physical concept\ncan sometimes be confusing. A simple\nand clear way of stating the third law is as\nfollows :\n\nForces always occur in pairs.  Force on a\nbody A by B is equal and opposite to the\nforce on the body B by A.\n\n2. The terms action and reaction in the third law\nmay give a wrong impression that action\n\ncomes before reaction i.e action is the cause\nand reaction the effect. There is no cause-\neffect relation implied in the third law.  The\nforce on A by B and the force on B by A act\nat the same instant.  By the same reasoning,\nany one of them may be called action and the\nother reaction.\n\n3. Action and reaction forces act on different\nbodies, not on the same body. Consider a pair\nof bodies A and B.  According to the third law,\n\nF\nAB\n\n  =  – F\nBA  \n\n(5.8)\n\n(force on A by B)  =  – (force on B by A)\n\nThus if we are considering the motion of any\n\none body (A or B), only one of the two forces is\n\nrelevant.  It is an error to add up the two forces\n\nand claim that the net force is zero.\n\nHowever, if you are considering the system\n\nof two bodies as a whole, F\nAB\n\n and F\nBA\n\n are\n\ninternal forces of the system (A + B). They add\n\nup to give a null force. Internal forces in a\n\nbody or a system of particles thus cancel away\n\nin pairs.  This is an important fact that\n\nenables the second law to be applicable to a\n\nbody or a system of particles (See Chapter 7).\n\nIsaac Newton (1642 – 1727)\n\nIsaac Newton was born in Woolsthorpe, England in 1642, the year Galileo died.\n\nHis extraordinary mathematical ability and mechanical aptitude remained hidden\n\nfrom others in his school life.   In 1662, he went to Cambridge for undergraduate\n\nstudies.  A plague epidemic in 1665 forced the university town to close and Newton\n\nhad to return to his mother’s farm. There in two years of solitude, his dormant\n\ncreativity blossomed in a deluge of fundamental discoveries in mathematics and\n\nphysics : binomial theorem for negative and fractional exponents, the beginning of\n\ncalculus, the inverse square law of gravitation, the spectrum of white light, and so\n\non. Returning to Cambridge, he pursued his investigations in optics and devised a\n\nreflecting telescope.\n\nIn 1684, encouraged by his friend Edmund Halley, Newton embarked on writing what was to be one of\n\nthe greatest scientific works ever published : The Principia Mathematica.  In it, he enunciated the three\n\nlaws of motion and the universal law of gravitation, which explained all the three Kepler’s laws of\n\nplanetary motion.  The book was packed with a host of path-breaking achievements : basic principles of\n\nfluid mechanics, mathematics of wave motion, calculation of masses of the earth, the sun and other\n\nplanets, explanation of the precession of equinoxes, theory of tides, etc. In 1704, Newton brought out\n\nanother masterpiece Opticks that summarized his work on light and colour.\n\nThe scientific revolution triggered by Copernicus and steered vigorously ahead by Kepler and Galileo\n\nwas brought to a grand completion by Newton. Newtonian mechanics unified terrestrial and celestial\n\nphenomena. The same mathematical equation governed the fall of an apple to the ground and the\n\nmotion of the moon around the earth.  The age of reason had dawned.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS98\n\n\uf074\n\nExample 5.5  Two identical billiard balls\nstrike a rigid wall with the same speed but\nat different angles, and get reflected without\nany change in speed,  as shown in Fig. 5.6.\nWhat is (i) the direction of the force on the\nwall due to each ball? (ii) the ratio of the\nmagnitudes of impulses imparted to the\nballs by the wall ?\n\n       Fig. 5.6\n\nAnswer  An instinctive answer to (i) might be\nthat the force on the wall in case (a) is normal to\nthe wall, while that in case (b) is inclined at 30°\nto the normal. This answer is wrong.  The force\non the wall is normal to the wall in both cases.\n\nHow to find the force on the wall? The trick is\nto consider the force (or impulse) on  the ball\ndue to  the wall using the second law, and then\nuse the third law to answer (i). Let u be the speed\nof each ball before and after collision with the\nwall, and m the mass of each ball. Choose the x\nand y axes as shown in the figure, and consider\nthe change in momentum of the ball in each\ncase :\n\nCase (a)\n\n( ) ( )initial initial 0x yp mu          p= =\n\n( ) ( )finalfinal 0x yp mu          p= − =\n\nImpulse is the change in momentum vector.\nTherefore,\n\nx-component of impulse  =  – 2 m u\ny-component of impulse  =   0\n\nImpulse and force are in the same direction.\nClearly, from above, the force on the ball due to\nthe wall is normal to the wall, along the negative\nx-direction.  Using Newton’s third law of motion,\nthe force on the wall due to the ball is normal to\nthe wall along the positive x-direction. The\n\nmagnitude of force cannot be ascertained since\nthe small time taken for the collision has not\nbeen specified in the problem.\n\nCase (b)\n\n( )  cos 30initialxp m u =\n\uf001 , ( )    sin 30initialyp m u = − \uf001\n\n( )  – cos 30finalxp m u =\n\uf001 , ( )   sin 30finalyp m u = − \uf001\n\nNote,  while p\nx\n changes sign  after collision,  p\n\ny\n\ndoes not.  Therefore,\n\nx-component of impulse = –2 m u  cos  30°\ny-component of impulse = 0\n\nThe direction of impulse (and force) is the same\nas in (a) and is normal to the wall along the\nnegative x direction.  As before, using Newton’s\nthird law, the force on the wall due to the ball is\nnormal to the wall along the positive x direction.\n\nThe ratio of the magnitudes  of the impulses\nimparted to the balls in (a) and (b) is\n\n( )\n2\n\n2 / 2 cos30 1.2\n3\n\nm u m u = ≈\n\uf001 \uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf074\n\n5.7  CONSERVATION OF MOMENTUM\n\nThe second and third laws of motion lead to\nan important consequence: the law of\nconservation of momentum.  Take a familiar\nexample. A bullet is fired  from a gun. If the force\non the bullet by the gun is F, the force on the gun\nby the bullet is – F, according to the third law.\nThe two forces act for a common interval of time\n∆t.  According to the second law, F ∆t is the\nchange in momentum of the bullet and – F ∆t is\nthe change in momentum of the gun. Since\ninitially, both are at rest, the change in\nmomentum equals the final momentum for each.\nThus if p\n\nb\n is the momentum of the bullet after\n\nfiring and p\ng \nis the recoil momentum of the gun,\n\np\ng\n = – p\n\nb\n  i.e. p\n\nb\n + p\n\ng\n = 0.  That is, the total\n\nmomentum of the (bullet + gun) system is\nconserved.\n\nThus in an isolated system (i.e. a system with\nno external force), mutual forces between pairs\nof particles in the system can cause momentum\nchange in individual particles, but since the\nmutual forces for each pair are equal and\nopposite, the momentum changes cancel in pairs\nand the total momentum remains unchanged.\nThis fact is known as the law of conservation\nof momentum :\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nLAWS OF MOTION 99\n\n\uf074\n\nThe total momentum of an isolated system\n\nof interacting particles is conserved.\n\nAn important example of the application of the\n\nlaw of conservation of momentum is the collision\n\nof two bodies. Consider two bodies A and B, with\n\ninitial momenta p\nA\n and p\n\nB\n. The bodies collide,\n\nget apart, with final momenta p′\nA\n and p′\n\nB\n\nrespectively. By the Second Law\n\nF p pAB A At∆ = ′ −\n \nand\n\nF p pBA B Bt∆ = ′ −\n\n(where we have taken a common interval of time\n\nfor both forces i.e. the time for which the two\n\nbodies are in contact.)\n\nSince F FAB BA= −  by the third law,\n\n( )′ − = − ′ −p p p pA A B B\ni.e. ′ + ′ = +p p p pA B A B   (5.9)\n\nwhich shows that the total final momentum of\n\nthe isolated system equals its initial momentum.\n\nNotice that this is true whether the collision is\n\nelastic or inelastic. In elastic collisions, there is\n\na second condition that the total initial kinetic\n\nenergy of the system equals the total final kinetic\n\nenergy (See Chapter 6).\n\n5.8  EQUILIBRIUM OF A PARTICLE\n\nEquilibrium of a particle in mechanics refers to\n\nthe situation when the net external force on the\n\nparticle is zero.*  According to the first law, this\nmeans that, the particle is either at rest or in\n\nuniform motion.\n\nIf two forces F\n1\n and F\n\n2\n, act on a particle,\n\nequilibrium requires\n\nF\n1  \n\n= −\n \nF\n\n2\n(5.10)\n\ni.e. the two forces on the particle  must be equal\n\nand opposite. Equilibrium under three\n\nconcurrent forces F\n1\n, F\n\n2\n  and F\n\n3\n requires that\n\nthe vector sum of the three forces is zero.\n\nF\n1\n  + F\n\n2\n  + F\n\n3\n  =  0                                  (5.11)\n\n* Equilibrium of a body requires not only translational equilibrium (zero net external force) but also rotational\nequilibrium (zero net external torque), as we shall see in Chapter 7.\n\nFig. 5.7  Equilibrium under concurrent forces.\n\nIn other words, the resultant of any two forces\nsay F\n\n1\n and F\n\n2\n, obtained by the parallelogram\n\nlaw of forces must be equal and opposite to the\nthird force, F\n\n3\n.  As seen in Fig. 5.7, the three\n\nforces in equilibrium can be represented by the\nsides of a triangle with the vector arrows taken\nin the same sense. The result can be\ngeneralised to any number of forces. A particle\nis in equilibrium under the action of forces F\n\n1\n,\n\nF\n2\n,... F\n\nn\n if they can be represented by the sides\n\nof a closed n-sided polygon with arrows directed\nin the same sense.\n\nEquation (5.11) implies that\n\nF\n1x \n\n+ F\n2x \n\n+ F\n3x\n\n = 0\n\nF\n1y\n\n + F\n2y\n\n + F\n3y\n\n = 0\n\nF\n1z\n\n + F\n2z\n\n + F\n3z\n\n = 0       (5.12)\n\nwhere F\n1x\n\n, F\n1y\n\n and F\n1z\n\n are the components of F\n1\n\nalong x, y and z directions respectively.\n\nExample 5.6   See Fig. 5.8. A mass of 6 kg\nis suspended by a  rope  of  length 2 m\nfrom the ceiling.  A force of 50 N in the\nhorizontal direction is  applied  at  the mid-\npoint P of the rope, as shown. What is the\nangle the rope makes with the vertical in\nequilibrium ?  (Take g = 10 m s-2). Neglect\nthe mass of the rope.\n\n(a) (b) (c)\nFig. 5.8\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS100\n\nAnswer  Figures 5.8(b) and 5.8(c) are known as\nfree-body diagrams.

The gravitational force is, of course,\npervasive.  Every object on the earth experiences\nthe force of gravity due to the earth. Gravity also\ngoverns the motion of celestial bodies.  The\ngravitational force can act at a distance without\nthe need of any intervening medium.\n\nAll the other forces common in mechanics are\ncontact forces.* As the name suggests, a contact\nforce on an object arises due to contact with some\nother object: solid or fluid. When bodies are in\ncontact (e.g.  a book resting on a table, a system\nof rigid bodies connected by rods, hinges and\n\nother types of supports), there are mutual\ncontact forces (for each pair of bodies) satisfying\nthe third law.  The component of contact force\nnormal to the surfaces in contact is called\nnormal reaction.  The component parallel to the\nsurfaces in contact is called friction.  Contact\nforces arise also when solids are in contact with\nfluids.  For example, for a solid immersed in a\nfluid, there is an upward bouyant force equal to\nthe weight of the fluid displaced. The viscous\nforce, air resistance, etc are also examples of\ncontact forces (Fig. 5.9).\n\nTwo other common forces are tension in a\nstring and the force due to spring. When a spring\nis compressed or extended by an external force,\na restoring force is generated. This force is\nusually proportional to the compression or\nelongation (for small displacements). The spring\nforce F is written as F = – k x where x is the\ndisplacement and k is the force constant. The\nnegative sign denotes that the force is opposite\nto the displacement from the unstretched state.\nFor an inextensible string, the force constant is\nvery high. The restoring force in a string is called\ntension. It is customary to use a constant tension\nT throughout the string. This assumption is true\nfor a string of negligible mass.\n\nIn Chapter 1, we learnt that there are four\nfundamental forces in nature.  Of these, the weak\nand strong forces appear in domains that do not\nconcern us here. Only the gravitational and\nelectrical forces are relevant in the context of\nmechanics. The different contact forces of\nmechanics mentioned above fundamentally arise\nfrom electrical forces.  This may seem surprising\n\n* We are not considering,  for simplicity, charged and magnetic bodies. For these, besides gravity, there are\nelectrical and magnetic non-contact forces.\n\nFig. 5.9  Some examples of contact forces in mechanics.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nLAWS OF MOTION 101\n\nsince we are talking of uncharged and non-\nmagnetic bodies in mechanics. At the microscopic\nlevel, all bodies are made of charged constituents\n(nuclei and electrons) and the various contact\nforces arising due to elasticity of bodies, molecular\ncollisions and impacts, etc. can ultimately be\ntraced to the electrical forces between the charged\nconstituents of different bodies. The detailed\nmicroscopic origin of these forces is, however,\ncomplex and not useful for handling problems in\nmechanics at the macroscopic scale.  This is why\nthey are treated as different types of forces with\ntheir characteristic properties determined\nempirically.\n\n5.9.1  Friction\n\nLet us return to the example of a body of mass m\nat rest on a horizontal table. The force of gravity\n(mg)  is cancelled by the normal reaction force\n(N) of the table. Now suppose a force F is applied\nhorizontally to the body.  We know from\nexperience that a small  applied force may not\nbe enough to move the body.  But if the applied\nforce F were the only external force on the body,\nit must move with acceleration F/m, however\nsmall. Clearly, the body remains at rest because\nsome other force comes into play in the\nhorizontal direction and opposes the applied\nforce F, resulting in zero net force on the body.\nThis force f\n\ns\n parallel to the surface of the body in\n\ncontact with the table is known as frictional\nforce, or simply friction (Fig. 5.10(a)).  The\nsubscript stands for static friction to distinguish\nit from kinetic friction f\n\nk\n that we consider later\n\n(Fig. 5.10(b)).  Note that  static friction does not\n\nFig. 5.10 Static and sliding friction: (a)  Impending\nmotion of the body is opposed by static\n\nfriction. When external force exceeds the\n\nmaximum limit of static friction, the body\n\nbegins to move.  (b) Once the body is in\n\nmotion, it is subject to sliding or kinetic friction\n\nwhich opposes relative motion between the\n\ntwo surfaces in contact. Kinetic friction is\n\nusually less than the maximum value of static\n\nexist by itself.  When there is no applied force,\nthere is no static friction. It comes into play the\nmoment there is an applied force. As the applied\nforce F increases, f\n\ns\n also increases, remaining\n\nequal and opposite to the applied force (up to a\ncertain limit), keeping the body at rest. Hence, it\nis called static friction.  Static friction opposes\nimpending motion. The term impending motion\nmeans motion that would take place (but does\nnot actually take place) under the applied force,\nif friction were absent.\n\nWe know from experience that as the applied\nforce exceeds a certain limit, the body begins to\nmove.  It is found experimentally that the limiting\n\nvalue of static friction ( )\nmaxs\n\nf  is independent of\n\nthe area of contact and varies with the normal\nforce(N)  approximately as :\n\n( )\nmax\n\ns sf N= µ (5.13)\n\nwhere µ\ns \n\nis a constant of proportionality\ndepending only on the nature of the surfaces in\ncontact. The constant µ\n\ns \n is called the coefficient\n\nof static friction.  The law of static friction may\nthus be written as\n\nf\ns\n  ≤  µ\n\ns \n N (5.14)\n\nIf the applied force F exceeds ( )\nmaxs\n\nf  the body\n\nbegins to slide on the surface. It is found\nexperimentally that when relative motion has\nstarted, the frictional force decreases from the\n\nstatic maximum value ( )\nmaxs\n\nf . Frictional force\n\nthat opposes relative motion between surfaces\nin contact is called kinetic or sliding friction and\nis denoted by f\n\nk \n.\n  \nKinetic friction, like static\n\nfriction, is found to be independent of the area\nof contact.  Further, it is nearly independent of\nthe velocity. It satisfies a law similar to that for\nstatic friction:\n\nk k\n=f Nµ (5.15)\n\nwhere µ\nk′\n the coefficient of kinetic friction,\n\ndepends only on the surfaces in contact. As\nmentioned above, experiments show that µ\n\nk\n is\n\nless than µ\ns\n. When relative motion has begun,\n\nthe acceleration of the body according to the\nsecond law is ( F – f\n\nk\n)/m.  For a body moving with\n\nconstant velocity, F = f\nk\n. If the applied force on\n\nthe body is removed, its acceleration is – f\nk \n/m\n\nand it eventually comes to a stop.\n       The laws of friction given above do not have\nthe status of fundamental laws like those for\ngravitational, electric and magnetic forces. They\nare empirical relations that are only\n\nfriction.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS102\n\n\uf074\n\n\uf074\n\napproximately true.  Yet they are very useful in\npractical calculations in mechanics.\n\nThus, when two bodies are in contact, each\nexperiences a contact force by the other. Friction,\nby definition, is the component of the contact force\nparallel to the surfaces in contact, which opposes\nimpending or actual relative motion between the\ntwo surfaces. Note that it is not motion, but\nrelative motion that the frictional force opposes.\nConsider a box lying in the compartment of a train\nthat is accelerating.  If the box is stationary\nrelative to the train, it is in fact accelerating along\nwith the train. What forces cause the acceleration\nof the box?  Clearly, the only conceivable force in\nthe horizontal direction is the force of friction. If\nthere were no friction, the floor of the train would\nslip by and the box would remain at its initial\nposition due to inertia (and hit the back side of\nthe train). This impending relative motion is\nopposed by the static friction f\n\ns\n. Static friction\n\nprovides the same acceleration to the box as that\nof the train, keeping it stationary relative to the\ntrain.\n\nExample 5.7 Determine the maximum\nacceleration of the train in which a box\nlying on its floor will remain stationary,\ngiven that the co-efficient of static friction\nbetween the box and the train’s floor is\n0.15.\n\nAnswer  Since the acceleration of the box is due\nto the static friction,\n\nma  =  f\ns\n ≤ µ\n\ns\n N  =  µ\n\ns\n  m g\n\ni.e.   a  ≤  µ\ns\n g\n\n∴ a\nmax\n\n =  µ\ns \ng  = 0.15  x 10 m s–2\n\n= 1.5  m s–2  \uf074\n\nExample 5.8  See Fig. 5.11. A mass of 4 kg\nrests on a horizontal plane. The plane is\ngradually inclined until at an angle θ  =  15°\nwith the horizontal, the mass just begins to\nslide. What is the coefficient of static friction\nbetween the block and the surface ?\n\nFig. 5.11\n\nAnswer  The forces acting on a block of mass m\nat rest on an inclined plane are (i) the weight\nmg acting vertically downwards (ii) the normal\nforce N of the plane on the block, and (iii) the\nstatic frictional force f\n\ns\n opposing the impending\n\nmotion. In equilibrium, the resultant of these\nforces must be zero.  Resolving the weight mg\nalong the two directions shown, we have\n\nm g sin θ  =  f\ns\n   ,     m g  cos θ    =  N\n\nAs θ  increases, the self-adjusting frictional force\nf\ns\n increases until at θ = θ\n\nmax\n,  f\n\ns\n achieves its\n\nmaximum value, ( )\nmaxs\n\nf = µ\ns\n N.\n\nTherefore,\n\ntan θ\nmax\n\n  =  µ\ns\n  or  θ\n\nmax\n  =  tan–1  µ\n\ns\n\nWhen  θ  becomes just a little more than  θ\nmax\n\n ,\nthere is a small net force on the block and it\nbegins to slide.  Note that  θ\n\nmax\n depends only on\n\nµ\ns\n and is  independent of the mass of the block.\n\nFor θ\nmax\n\n   =  15°,\nµ\n\ns\n      =  tan 15°\n\n =  0.27 \uf074\n\nExample 5.9  What is the acceleration of\nthe block  and  trolley system shown in a\nFig. 5.12(a), if the coefficient of kinetic friction\nbetween the trolley and the surface is 0.04?\nWhat is the tension in the string? (Take g =\n10 m s-2).  Neglect the mass of the string.\n\n(a)\n\n(b) (c)\n\nFig. 5.12\n\n\uf074\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nLAWS OF MOTION 103\n\nis the reason why discovery of the wheel has\nbeen a major milestone in human history.\n\nRolling friction again has a complex origin,\nthough somewhat different from that of static\nand sliding friction. During rolling, the surfaces\nin contact get momentarily deformed a little, and\nthis results in a finite area (not a point) of the\nbody being in contact with the surface.  The net\neffect is that the component of the contact force\nparallel to the surface opposes motion.\n\nWe often regard friction as something\nundesirable. In many situations, like in a\nmachine with different moving parts, friction\ndoes have a negative role. It opposes relative\nmotion and thereby dissipates power in the form\nof heat, etc. Lubricants are a way of reducing\nkinetic friction in a machine. Another way is to\nuse ball bearings between two moving parts of a\nmachine [Fig. 5.13(a)]. Since the rolling friction\nbetween ball bearings and the surfaces in\ncontact is very small, power dissipation is\nreduced. A thin cushion of air maintained\nbetween solid surfaces in relative motion is\nanother effective way of reducing friction (Fig.\n5.13(a)).\n\nIn many practical situations, however, friction\nis critically needed. Kinetic friction that\ndissipates power is nevertheless important for\nquickly stopping relative motion. It is made use\nof by brakes in machines and automobiles.\nSimilarly, static friction is important in daily\nlife.  We are able to walk because of friction.  It\nis impossible for a car to move on a very slippery\nroad. On an ordinary road, the friction between\nthe tyres and the road provides the necessary\nexternal force to accelerate the car.\n\nAnswer  As the string is inextensible, and the\npully is smooth, the 3 kg block and the 20 kg\ntrolley both have same magnitude of\nacceleration.  Applying second law to motion of\nthe block (Fig. 5.12(b)),\n\n30 – T  = 3a\nApply the second law to motion of the trolley (Fig.\n5.12(c)),\n\nT – f\nk\n  =  20 a.\n\nNow      f\nk\n\n= µ\nk\n N,\n\nHere        µ\nk\n\n= 0.04,\n     N   =  20 x 10\n\n= 200 N.\nThus the equation for the motion of the trolley is\n\nT – 0.04 x 200 = 20 a Or  T – 8 = 20a.\n\nThese equations give a = \n22\n\n23\n\n m s –2 = 0.96 m s-2\n\nand T  = 27.1 N.                                                 \uf074\n\nRolling friction\n\nA body like a ring or a sphere rolling without\nslipping over a horizontal plane will suffer no\nfriction, in principle. At every instant, there is\njust one point of contact between the body and\nthe plane and this point has no motion relative\nto the plane. In this ideal situation, kinetic or\nstatic friction is zero and the body should\ncontinue to roll with constant velocity.  We know,\nin practice, this will not happen and some\nresistance to motion (rolling friction) does occur,\ni.e. to keep the body rolling, some applied force\nis needed. For the same weight, rolling friction\nis much smaller (even by 2 or 3 orders of\nmagnitude) than static or sliding friction.  This\n\nFig. 5.13 Some ways of reducing friction.

This force\ndirected forwards the centre is called the\ncentripetal force. For a stone rotated in a circle\nby a string, the centripetal force is provided by\nthe tension in the string.  The centripetal force\nfor motion of a planet around the sun is the\n\nis the static friction that provides the centripetal\nacceleration. Static friction opposes the\nimpending motion of the car moving away from\nthe circle. Using equation (5.14) & (5.16) we get\nthe result\n\n= ≤\n2\n\ns\n\nmv\nf N\n\nR\nµ\n\n2 s\ns\n\nRN\nv Rg\n\nm\n\nµ\nµ≤ = [\uf001N = mg]\n\nwhich is independent of the mass of the car.\nThis shows that for a given value of µ\n\ns\n and R,\n\nthere is a maximum speed of circular motion of\nthe car possible, namely\n\nmax sv Rgµ=       (5.18)\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFig. 5.14  Circular motion of a car on (a) a level road, (b) a banked road.\n\ngravitational force on the planet due to the sun.\nFor a car taking a circular turn on a horizontal\nroad, the centripetal force is the force of friction.\n\nThe circular motion of a car on a flat and\nbanked road give interesting application of the\nlaws of motion.\n\nMotion of a car on a level road\n\nThree forces act on the car (Fig. 5.14(a):\n(i) The weight of the car, mg\n(ii) Normal reaction, N\n(iii) Frictional force, f\nAs there is no acceleration in the vertical\ndirection\nN – mg = 0\nN = mg      (5.17)\nThe centripetal force required for circular motion\nis along the surface of the road, and is provided\nby the component of the contact force between\nroad and the car tyres along the surface. This\nby definition is the frictional force. Note that it\n\nMotion of a car on a banked road\n\nWe can reduce the contribution of friction to the\ncircular motion of the car if the road is banked\n(Fig. 5.14(b)). Since there is no acceleration along\nthe vertical direction, the net force along this\ndirection must be zero. Hence,\n\nN cos θ  = mg + f sin θ         (5.19a)\n\nThe centripetal force is provided by the horizontal\ncomponents of N and f.\n\nN sin θ  + f cos θ  = \n2\n\nmv\n\nR\n                (5.19b)\n\nBut f sNµ≤\n\nThus to obtain v\nmax \n\n we put\n\ns\nf Nµ= .\n\nThen Eqs.

(5.21 ),\n\nv\no  \n\n=\n  \n( R g  tan θ ) ½ (5.22)\n\nAt this speed, frictional force is not needed at all\nto provide the necessary centripetal force.\nDriving at this speed on a banked road will cause\nlittle wear and tear of the tyres. The same\nequation also tells you that for v < v\n\no\n, frictional\n\nforce will be up the slope and that a car can be\nparked only if tan θ  ≤  µ\n\ns\n.\n\nExample  5.10  A cyclist speeding at\n18 km/h on a level road takes a sharp\ncircular turn of radius 3 m without reducing\nthe speed. The co-efficient of static friction\nbetween the tyres and the road is 0.1. Will\nthe cyclist slip while taking the turn?\n\nAnswer   On an unbanked road, frictional force\nalone can provide the centripetal force needed\nto keep the cyclist moving on a circular turn\nwithout  slipping. If the speed is too large, or if\nthe turn is too sharp (i.e. of too small a radius)\nor both, the frictional force is not sufficient to\nprovide the necessary centripetal force, and the\ncyclist slips. The condition for the cyclist not to\nslip is given by Eq. (5.18) :\n\nv2  ≤  µ\ns\n R g\n\nNow, R = 3 m,  g = 9.8 m s-2,  µ\ns\n = 0.1.  That is,\n\nµ\ns\n R g = 2.94 m2 s-2. v = 18  km/h = 5  m s-1; i.e.,\n\nv2 = 25  m2 s-2.  The condition is not obeyed.\nThe cyclist will slip while taking the circular\nturn. \uf074\n\nExample 5.11 A circular racetrack of\nradius 300 m is banked at an angle of 15°.\nIf the coefficient of friction between the\nwheels of a race-car and the road is 0.2,\nwhat is the (a) optimum speed of the race-\ncar to avoid wear and tear on its tyres, and\n(b) maximum permissible speed to avoid\nslipping ?\n\nAnswer  On a banked road, the horizontal\ncomponent of the normal force and the frictional\nforce contribute to provide centripetal force to\nkeep the car moving on a circular turn without\nslipping.  At the optimum speed, the normal\nreaction’s component is enough to provide the\nneeded centripetal force, and the frictional force\nis not needed.  The optimum speed v\n\no\n is given by\n\nEq.  (5.22):\nv\n\nO\n  =  (R g tan θ)1/2\n\nHere R  =  300 m,  θ  =  15°,  g  =  9.8  m s-2;  we\nhave\n\nv\nO\n  =  28.1  m s-1.\n\nThe maximum permissible speed v\nmax\n\n is given by\nEq.

A typical problem in\nmechanics usually does not merely involve a\nsingle body under the action of given forces.\nMore often, we will need to consider an assembly\nof different bodies exerting forces on each other.\nBesides, each body in the assembly experiences\nthe force of gravity.  When trying to solve a\nproblem of this type, it is useful to remember\nthe fact that we can choose any part of the\nassembly and apply the laws of motion to that\npart provided  we include all forces on the chosen\npart due to the  remaining parts of the assembly.\nWe may call the chosen part of the assembly as\nthe system and the remaining part of the\nassembly (plus any other agencies of forces) as\nthe environment. We have followed the same\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS106\n\n\uf074\n\nmethod in solved examples. To handle a typical\nproblem in mechanics systematically, one\nshould use the following steps :\n(i) Draw a diagram showing schematically the\n\nvarious parts of the assembly of bodies, the\nlinks, supports, etc.\n\n(ii) Choose a convenient part of the assembly\nas one system.\n\n(iii) Draw a separate diagram which shows this\nsystem and all the forces on the system by\nthe remaining part of the assembly.  Include\nalso the forces on the system by other\nagencies. Do not include the forces on the\nenvironment by the system.  A diagram of\nthis type is known as ‘a free-body diagram’.\n(Note this does not imply that the system\nunder consideration is without a net force).\n\n(iv) In a free-body diagram, include information\nabout forces (their magnitudes and\ndirections) that are either given or you are\nsure of (e.g., the direction of tension in a\nstring along its length).  The rest should be\ntreated as unknowns to be determined using\nlaws of motion.\n\n(v) If necessary, follow the same procedure for\nanother choice of the system.  In doing so,\nemploy Newton’s third law.  That is, if in the\nfree-body diagram of A, the force on A due to\nB is shown as F, then in the free-body\ndiagram of B, the force on B due to A should\nbe shown as –F.\n\nThe following example illustrates the above\nprocedure :\n\nExample 5.12 See Fig. 5.15. A wooden\nblock of mass 2 kg rests on a soft horizontal\nfloor.  When an iron cylinder of mass 25 kg\nis placed on top of the block, the floor yields\nsteadily and the block and the cylinder\ntogether go down with an acceleration of\n0.1 m s–2.  What is the action of the block\non the floor (a) before and (b) after the floor\nyields ? Take g = 10 m s–2. Identify the\naction-reaction pairs in the problem.\n\nAnswer\n\n(a) The block is at rest on the floor. Its free-body\ndiagram shows two forces on the block, the\nforce of gravitational attraction by the earth\nequal to 2 × 10 = 20 N; and the normal force\nR of the floor on the block. By the First Law,\n\nthe net force on the block must be zero i.e.,\nR = 20 N.  Using third law the action of the\nblock (i.e. the force exerted on the floor by\nthe block) is equal to 20 N and directed\nvertically downwards.\n\n(b) The system (block + cylinder) accelerates\ndownwards with 0.1 m s-2. The free-body\ndiagram of the system shows two forces on\nthe system : the force of gravity due to the\nearth (270 N); and the normal force R ′ by the\nfloor.  Note, the free-body diagram of the\nsystem does not show the internal forces\nbetween the block and the cylinder.  Applying\nthe second law to the system,\n\n270 – R′   =  27 × 0.1N\n                 ie. R′   =  267.3 N\n\nFig. 5.15\n\nBy the third law, the  action  of the system on\nthe floor is equal to 267.3 N vertically downward.\n\nAction-reaction pairs\n\nFor (a): (i) the force of gravity (20 N) on the block\nby the earth (say, action); the force of\ngravity on the earth by the block\n(reaction) equal to 20 N directed\nupwards (not shown in the figure).\n(ii) the force on the floor by the block\n(action); the force on the block by the\nfloor (reaction).\n\nFor (b): (i) the force of gravity (270 N) on the\nsystem by the earth (say, action); the\nforce of gravity on the earth by the\nsystem (reaction), equal to 270 N,\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nLAWS OF MOTION 107\n\ndirected upwards (not shown in the\nfigure).\n(ii) the force on the floor by the system\n(action); the force on the system by the\nfloor (reaction).  In addition, for (b), the\nforce on the block by the cylinder and\nthe force on the cylinder by the block\nalso constitute an action-reaction pair.\n\nThe important thing to remember is that an\naction-reaction pair consists of mutual forces\nwhich are always equal and opposite between\ntwo bodies.  Two forces on the same body which\nhappen to be equal and opposite can never\nconstitute an action-reaction pair. The force of\n\ngravity on the mass in (a) or (b) and the normal\nforce on the mass by the floor are not action-\nreaction pairs. These forces happen to be equal\nand opposite for (a) since the mass is at rest.\nThey are not so for case (b), as seen already.\nThe weight of the system is 270 N, while the\nnormal force R′ is 267.3 N. \uf074\n\nThe practice of drawing free-body diagrams is\nof great help in solving problems in mechanics.\nIt allows you to clearly define your system and\nconsider all forces on the system due to objects\nthat are not part of the system itself.  A number\nof exercises in this and subsequent chapters will\nhelp you cultivate this practice.\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. Aristotle’s view that a force is necessary to keep a body in uniform motion is wrong.  A\nforce is necessary in practice to counter the opposing force of friction.\n\n2. Galileo extrapolated simple observations on motion of bodies on inclined planes, and\narrived at the law of inertia.  Newton’s first law of motion is the same law rephrased\nthus: “Everybody continues to be in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line,\nunless compelled by some external force to act otherwise”.  In simple terms, the First Law\nis “If external force on a body is zero, its acceleration is zero”.\n\n3. Momentum (p ) of a body is the product of its mass (m) and velocity (v) :\np  =  m v\n\n4. Newton’s second law of motion :\nThe rate of change of momentum of a body is proportional to the applied force and takes\n\nplace in the direction in which the force acts.  Thus\n\nd\n\nd\nk k m \n\nt\n= =\n\np\nF a\n\nwhere F is the net external force on the body and a its acceleration. We set the constant\nof proportionality k = 1 in SI units.  Then\n\nd\n\nd\nm\n\nt\n= =\n\np\nF a\n\nThe SI unit of force is newton : 1 N = 1 kg m s-2.\n(a) The second law is consistent with the First Law (F = 0 implies a = 0)\n(b) It is a vector equation\n(c) It is applicable to a particle, and also to a body or a system of particles, provided  F\n\nis the total external force on the system and a  is the acceleration of the system as\na whole.\n\n(d) F at a point at a certain instant determines a at the same point at that instant.\nThat is the Second Law is a local law; a at an instant does not depend on the\nhistory of motion.\n\n5. Impulse is the product of force and time which equals change in momentum.\nThe notion of impulse is useful when a large force acts for a short time to produce a\nmeasurable change in momentum. Since the time of action of the force is very short,\none can assume that there is no appreciable change in the position of the body during\nthe action of the impulsive force.\n\n6. Newton’s third law of motion:\nTo every action, there is always an equal and opposite reaction\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS108\n\nIn simple terms, the law can be stated thus :\nForces in nature always occur between pairs of bodies.  Force on a body A by body\n\nB is equal and opposite to the force on the body B by A.\n\nAction and reaction forces are simultaneous forces.  There is no cause-effect\nrelation between action and reaction.  Any of the two mutual forces can be\ncalled action and the other reaction.  Action and reaction act on different\nbodies and so they cannot be cancelled out.  The internal action and reaction\nforces between different parts of a body do, however, sum to zero.\n\n7. Law of Conservation of Momentum\nThe total momentum of an isolated system of particles is conserved.  The law\nfollows from the second and third law of motion.\n\n8. Friction\nFrictional force opposes (impending or actual) relative motion between two\nsurfaces in contact.  It is the component of the contact force along the common\ntangent to the surface in contact.  Static friction f\n\ns\n opposes impending relative\n\nmotion; kinetic friction f\nk\n opposes actual relative motion. They are independent\n\nof the area of contact and satisfy the following approximate laws :\n\n( )\nmax\n\nf f Rs s s≤ = µ\n\nk\nf R\n\nk\n= µ\n\nµ\ns\n (co-efficient of static friction) and µ\n\nk\n (co-efficient of kinetic friction) are\n\nconstants characteristic of the pair of surfaces in contact.  It is found\nexperimentally that µ\n\nk \nis less than µ\n\ns \n.\n\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n\n1. Force is not always in the direction of motion.  Depending on the situation, F\nmay be along v, opposite to v, normal to v or may make some other angle with\nv.  In every case, it is parallel to acceleration.\n\n2. If v = 0 at an instant, i.e. if a body is momentarily at rest, it does not mean that\nforce or acceleration are necessarily zero at that instant.  For example, when a\nball thrown upward reaches its maximum height, v = 0 but the force continues\nto be its weight mg and the acceleration is not zero but g.\n\n3. Force on a body at a given time is determined by the situation at the location of\nthe body at that time.  Force is not ‘carried’ by the body from its earlier history of\nmotion.  The moment after a stone is released out of an accelerated train, there is\nno horizontal force (or acceleration) on the stone, if the effects of the surrounding\nair are neglected.  The stone then has only the vertical force of gravity.\n\n4. In the second law of motion F = m a, F stands for the net force due to all\nmaterial agencies external to the body.  a is the effect of the force.  ma should\nnot be regarded as yet another force, besides F.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nLAWS OF MOTION 109\n\n5. The centripetal force should not be regarded as yet another kind of force. It is\nsimply a name given to the force that provides inward radial acceleration to a\nbody in circular motion. We should always look for some material force like\ntension, gravitational force, electrical force, friction, etc as the centripetal force\nin any circular motion.\n\n6. Static friction is a self-adjusting force up to its limit µ\ns\n N (f\n\ns \n≤ µ\n\ns\n N).  Do not put\n\nf\ns\n= µ\n\ns \nN\n\n \n without being sure that the maximum value of static friction is coming\n\ninto play.\n7. The familiar equation mg = R for a body on a table is true only if the body is in\n\nequilibrium.  The two forces mg and R can be different (e.g. a body in an\naccelerated lift). The equality of mg and R has no connection with the third\nlaw.\n\n8. The terms ‘action’ and ‘reaction’ in the third Law of Motion simply stand for\nsimultaneous mutual forces between a pair of bodies. Unlike their meaning in\nordinary language, action does not precede or cause reaction.  Action and reaction\nact on different bodies.\n\n9. The different terms like ‘friction’, ‘normal reaction’ ‘tension’, ‘air resistance’,\n‘viscous drag’, ‘thrust’, ‘buoyancy’, ‘weight’, ‘centripetal force’ all stand for ‘force’\nin different contexts.  For clarity, every force and its equivalent terms\nencountered in mechanics should be reduced to the phrase ‘force on A by B’.\n\n10. For applying the second law of motion, there is no conceptual distinction between\ninanimate and animate objects.  An animate object such as a human also\nrequires an external  force to accelerate.  For example, without the external\nforce of friction, we cannot walk on the ground.\n\n11. The objective concept of force in physics should not be confused with the\nsubjective concept of the ‘feeling of force’.  On a merry-go-around, all parts of\nour body are subject to an  inward force,  but we have a feeling of being pushed\noutward – the direction of impending motion.\n\nEXERCISES\n\n(For simplicity in numerical calculations, take g = 10 m s-2)\n5.1 Give the magnitude and direction of the net force acting on\n\n(a) a drop of rain falling down with a constant speed,\n(b) a cork of mass 10 g floating  on water,\n(c) a kite skillfully held stationary in the sky,\n(d) a car moving with a constant velocity of 30 km/h on a rough road,\n(e) a high-speed electron in space far from all material objects, and free of\n\nelectric and magnetic fields.\n\n5.2 A  pebble of mass 0.05 kg is thrown vertically upwards.
