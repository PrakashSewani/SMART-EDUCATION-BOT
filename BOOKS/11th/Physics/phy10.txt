Liquids and gases can  flow\nand are therefore, called  fluids.  It is this property that\ndistinguishes liquids and gases from solids in a basic way.\n\nFluids are everywhere around us. Earth has an envelop of\nair and two-thirds of its surface is covered with water.  Water\nis not only necessary for our existence; every mammalian\nbody constitute mostly of water. All the  processes occurring\nin living beings including plants are mediated by fluids. Thus\nunderstanding the behaviour and properties of fluids is\nimportant.\n\nHow are fluids different from solids? What is common in\nliquids and gases? Unlike  a solid, a fluid has no definite\nshape of its own. Solids and liquids have a fixed volume,\nwhereas a gas fills the entire volume of its container. We\nhave learnt in the previous chapter that the volume of solids\ncan be changed by stress. The volume of solid, liquid or gas\ndepends on the stress or pressure acting on it. When we\ntalk about fixed volume of solid or liquid, we mean its volume\nunder atmospheric pressure. The difference between gases\nand solids or liquids is that for solids or liquids the change\nin volume due to  change of external pressure is rather small.\nIn other words solids and liquids have much lower\ncompressibility as compared to gases.\n\nShear stress can change the shape of a solid keeping its\nvolume fixed. The key property of fluids is that they offer\nvery little resistance to shear stress; their shape changes by\napplication of very small shear stress. The shearing stress\nof fluids is about million times smaller than that of solids.\n\n10.2  PRESSURE\n\nA sharp needle when pressed against our skin pierces it. Our\nskin, however, remains intact when a blunt object with a\nwider contact area (say the back of a spoon) is pressed against\nit with the same force. If an elephant were to step on a man’s\nchest, his ribs would crack. A circus performer across whose\n\n10.1 Introduction\n\n10.2 Pressure\n\n10.3 Streamline flow\n\n10.4 Bernoulli’s principle\n\n10.5 Viscosity\n\n10.6 Surface tension\n\nSummary\n\nPoints to ponder\n\nExercises\n\nAdditional exercises\n\nAppendix\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nchest a large, light but strong wooden plank is\nplaced first, is saved from this accident. Such\neveryday experiences convince us that both the\nforce and its coverage area are important. Smaller\nthe area on which the force acts, greater is the\nimpact. This impact is known as pressure.\n\nWhen an object is submerged in a fluid at\nrest, the fluid exerts a force on its surface. This\nforce is always normal to the object’s surface.\nThis is so because if there were a component of\nforce parallel to the surface, the object will also\nexert a force on the fluid parallel to it; as a\nconsequence of Newton’s third law. This force\nwill cause the fluid to flow parallel to the surface.\nSince the fluid is at rest, this cannot happen.\nHence, the force exerted by the fluid at rest has\nto be perpendicular to the surface in contact\nwith it. This is shown in Fig.10.1(a).\n\nThe normal force exerted by the fluid at a point\nmay be measured. An idealised form of one such\npressure-measuring device is shown in Fig.\n10.1(b). It consists of an evacuated chamber with\na spring that is calibrated to measure the force\nacting on the piston. This device is placed at a\npoint inside the fluid. The inward force exerted\nby the fluid on the piston is balanced by the\noutward spring force and is thereby measured.\n\nIf F is the magnitude of this normal force on the\npiston of area A then the average pressure P\n\nav\n\nis defined as the normal force acting per unit\narea.\n\nP\nF\n\nA\nav =              (10.1)\n\nIn principle, the piston area can be made\narbitrarily small. The pressure is then defined\nin a limiting sense as\n\nP = \nlim\n\n∆A 0→\n∆\n∆\n\nF\n\nA\n(10.2)\n\nPressure is a scalar quantity. We remind the\nreader that it is the component of the force\nnormal to the area under consideration and not\nthe (vector) force that appears in the numerator\nin Eqs. (10.1) and (10.2). Its dimensions are\n[ML–1T–2]. The SI unit of pressure is N m–2. It has\nbeen named as pascal (Pa) in honour of the\nFrench scientist Blaise Pascal (1623-1662) who\ncarried out pioneering studies on fluid pressure.\nA common unit of pressure is the atmosphere\n(atm), i.e. the pressure exerted by the\natmosphere at sea level (1 atm = 1.013 ×  105 Pa).\n\nAnother quantity, that is indispensable in\ndescribing fluids, is the density ρ. For a fluid of\nmass m occupying volume V,\n\nρ =\nm\n\nV\n(10.3)\n\nThe dimensions of density are [ML–3]. Its SI\nunit is kg m–3. It is a positive scalar quantity. A\nliquid is largely incompressible and its density\nis therefore, nearly constant at all pressures.\nGases, on the other hand exhibit a large\nvariation in densities with pressure.\n\nThe density of water at 4\no\nC (277 K) is\n\n1.0 ×  103 kg m–3. The relative density of a\nsubstance is the ratio of its density to the\ndensity of water at 4oC. It is a dimensionless\npositive scalar quantity. For example the relative\ndensity of aluminium is 2.7. Its density is\n2.7 ×  103 kg m–3.  The densities of some common\nfluids are displayed in Table 10.1.\n\nTable 10.1 Densities of some common fluids\n\nat STP*(a) (b)\nFig. 10.1 (a) The force exerted by the liquid in the\n\nbeaker on the submerged object or on the\n\nwalls is normal (perpendicular) to the\n\nsurface at all points.\n\n(b) An idealised device for measuring\n\npressure.\n\n* STP means standard temperature (00C) and 1 atm pressure.\n\nMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS 251\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n252 PHYSICS\n\nt\n\nExample 10.1   The two thigh bones\n(femurs), each of cross-sectional area10 cm2\n\nsupport the upper part of a human body of\nmass 40 kg. Estimate the average pressure\nsustained by the femurs.\n\nAnswer   Total cross-sectional area of the\nfemurs is A = 2 ×  10 cm2 = 20 ×  10–4 m2. The\nforce acting on them is F = 40 kg wt = 400 N\n(taking g = 10 m s–2). This force is acting\nvertically down and hence, normally on the\nfemurs. Thus, the average pressure is\n\n25\nm N 10  2    \n\n−×==\nA\n\nF\nPav                             t\n\n10.2.1 Pascal’s Law\n\nThe French scientist Blaise Pascal observed that\nthe pressure in a fluid at rest is the same at all\npoints if they are at the same height. This fact\nmay be demonstrated in a simple way.\n\nFig. 10.2 shows an element in the interior of\na fluid at rest. This element ABC-DEF is in the\nform of a right-angled prism. In principle, this\nprismatic element is very small so that every\npart of it can be considered at the same depth\nfrom the liquid surface and therefore, the effect\nof the gravity is the same at all these points.\nBut for clarity we have enlarged this element.\nThe forces on this element are those exerted by\nthe rest of the fluid and they must be normal to\nthe surfaces of the element as discussed above.\nThus, the fluid exerts pressures P\n\na\n, P\n\nb \nand P\n\nc\n on\n\nthis element of area corresponding to the normal\nforces F\n\na\n, F\n\nb\n and F\n\nc\n as shown in Fig. 10.2 on the\n\nfaces BEFC, ADFC and ADEB denoted by A\na\n, A\n\nb\n\nand A\nc\n respectively. Then\n\nF\nb \nsinθ = F\n\nc\n, F\n\nb \ncosθ = F\n\na\n(by equilibrium)\n\nA\nb \nsinθ = A\n\nc\n, A\n\nb \ncosθ = A\n\na\n(by geometry)\n\nThus,\n\n;b c a b c a\nb c a\n\nF F F\nP P P\n\nA A A\n= = = = (10.4)\n\nHence, pressure exerted is same in all\ndirections in a fluid at rest. It again reminds us\nthat like other types of stress, pressure is not a\nvector quantity. No direction can be assigned\nto it.  The force against any area within (or\nbounding) a fluid at rest and under pressure is\nnormal to the area, regardless of the orientation\nof the area.\n\nNow consider a fluid element in the form of a\nhorizontal bar of uniform cross-section. The bar\nis in equilibrium. The horizontal forces exerted\nat its two ends  must be balanced or the\npressure at the two ends should be equal. This\nproves that for a liquid in equilibrium the\npressure is same at all points in a horizontal\nplane. Suppose the pressure were not equal in\ndifferent parts of the fluid, then there would be\na flow as the  fluid will have some net force\nacting on it. Hence in the absence of flow the\npressure in the fluid must be same everywhere\nin a horizontal plane.\n\n10.2.2 Variation of Pressure with Depth\n\nConsider a fluid at rest in a container. In\nFig. 10.3 point 1 is at height h above a point 2.\nThe pressures at points 1 and 2 are P\n\n1\n and P\n\n2\n\nrespectively. Consider a cylindrical element of\nfluid having area of base A and height h. As the\nfluid is at rest the resultant horizontal forces\nshould be zero and the resultant vertical forces\nshould balance the weight of the element. The\nforces acting in the vertical direction are due to\nthe fluid pressure at the top (P\n\n1\nA) acting\n\ndownward, at the bottom (P\n2\nA) acting upward.\n\nIf mg is weight of the fluid in the cylinder we\nhave\n\n(P\n2 \n\n− P\n1\n) A = mg (10.5)\n\nNow, if ρ is the mass density of the fluid, we\nhave the mass of fluid to be m = ρV= ρhA so\nthat\n\nP\n2 \n\n−\n \nP\n\n1\n=  ρgh (10.6)\n\nFig. 10.2 Proof of Pascal’s law. ABC-DEF is an\nelement of the interior of a fluid at rest.\n\nThis element is in the form of a right-\n\nangled prism. The element is small so that\n\nthe effect of gravity can be ignored, but it\n\nhas been enlarged for the sake of clarity.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS 253\n\nt\n\nFig.10.3 Fluid under gravity. The effect of gravity is\nillustrated through pressure on a vertical\n\ncylindrical column.\n\nPressure difference depends on the vertical\n\ndistance h between the points (1 and 2), mass\n\ndensity of the fluid ρ and acceleration due to\ngravity g. If the point 1 under discussion is\n\nshifted to the top of the  fluid (say, water), which\n\nis open to the atmosphere, P\n1\n may be replaced\n\nby atmospheric pressure (P\na\n) and we replace P\n\n2\n\nby P. Then Eq. (10.6) gives\n\nP =\n \nP\n\na \n+ ρgh (10.7)\n\nThus, the pressure P, at depth below the\n\nsurface of a liquid open to the atmosphere is\n\ngreater than atmospheric pressure by an\n\namount ρgh. The excess of pressure, P −\n \nP\n\na\n, at\n\ndepth h is called a gauge pressure at that point.\n\nThe area of the cylinder is not appearing in\n\nthe expression of absolute pressure in Eq. (10.7).\n\nThus, the height of the fluid column is important\n\nand not cross-sectional or base area or the shape\n\nof the container. The liquid pressure is the same\n\nat all points at the same horizontal level (same\n\ndepth).  The result is appreciated through the\n\nexample of hydrostatic paradox. Consider three\n\nvessels A, B and C  [Fig.10.4] of different shapes.\n\nThey are connected at the bottom by a horizontal\n\npipe. On filling with water, the level in the three\n\nvessels is the same, though they hold different\n\namounts of water. This is so because water at\n\nthe bottom has the same pressure below each\n\nsection of the vessel.\n\nFig 10.4 Illustration of hydrostatic paradox. The\nthree vessels A, B and C contain different\n\namounts of liquids, all upto the same\n\nheight.\n\nExample 10.2 What is the pressure on a\nswimmer 10 m below the surface of a lake?\n\nAnswer Here\nh = 10 m and ρ = 1000 kg m-3. Take g = 10 m s–2\n\nFrom Eq. (10.7)\nP =\n\n \nP\n\na \n+ ρgh\n\n   = 1.01 × 105 Pa + 1000 kg m–3 × 10 m s–2 × 10 m\n   = 2.01 × 105 Pa\n    ≈ 2 atm\n\nThis is a 100% increase in pressure from\nsurface level. At a depth of 1 km, the increase\nin pressure is 100 atm! Submarines are designed\nto withstand such enormous pressures.   t\n\n10.2.3 Atmospheric Pressure and\nGauge Pressure\n\nThe pressure of the atmosphere at any point is\nequal to the weight of a column of air of unit\ncross-sectional area extending from that point\nto the top of the atmosphere. At sea level, it is\n1.013 × 105 Pa (1 atm). Italian scientist\nEvangelista Torricelli (1608–1647) devised for\nthe first time a method for measuring\natmospheric pressure. A long glass tube closed\nat one end and filled with mercury is inverted\ninto a trough of mercury as shown in Fig.10.5 (a).\nThis device is known as ‘mercury barometer’.\nThe space above the mercury column in the tube\ncontains only mercury vapour whose pressure\nP is so small  that it may be neglected. Thus,\nthe pressure at Point A=0. The pressure inside\nthe coloumn at Point B must be the same as the\npressure at Point C, which is atmospheric\npressure, Pa.\n\nP\na \n= ρgh (10.8)\n\nwhere ρ is the density of mercury and h is the\nheight of the mercury column in the tube.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n254 PHYSICS\n\nt\n\nt\n\nIn the experiment it is found that the mercury\ncolumn in the barometer has a height of about\n76 cm at sea level equivalent to one atmosphere\n(1 atm). This can also be obtained using the\nvalue of ρ in Eq. (10.8). A common way of stating\npressure is in terms of cm or mm of mercury\n(Hg). A pressure equivalent of 1 mm is called a\ntorr (after Torricelli).\n\n1 torr = 133 Pa.\nThe mm of Hg and torr are used in medicine\n\nand physiology. In meteorology, a common unit\nis the bar and millibar.\n\n1 bar = 105 Pa\nAn open tube manometer is a useful\n\ninstrument for measuring pressure differences.\nIt consists of a U-tube containing a suitable\nliquid i.e., a low density liquid (such as oil) for\nmeasuring small pressure differences and a\nhigh density liquid (such as mercury) for large\npressure differences. One end of the tube is open\nto the atmosphere and the other end is\nconnected to the system whose pressure we want\nto measure [see Fig. 10.5 (b)]. The pressure P at\nA is equal to pressure at point B. What we\nnormally measure is the gauge pressure, which\nis P − P\n\na\n, given by Eq. (10.8) and is proportional\n\nto manometer height h.\n\nPressure is same at the same level on both\nsides of the U-tube containing a fluid. For\nliquids, the density varies very little over wide\nranges in pressure and temperature and we can\ntreat it safely as a constant for our present\npurposes. Gases on the other hand, exhibits\nlarge variations of densities with changes in\npressure and temperature. Unlike gases, liquids\nare, therefore, largely treated as incompressible.\n\nExample 10.3 The density of the\natmosphere at sea level is 1.29 kg/m3.\nAssume that it does not change with\naltitude. Then how high would the\natmosphere extend?\n\nAnswer We use Eq. (10.7)\n\nρgh  =  1.29 kg m–3 × 9.8 m s2 × h  m = 1.01 × 105 Pa\n\n∴ h = 7989 m ≈ 8 km\nIn reality the density of air decreases with\n\nheight. So does the value of g. The atmospheric\n\ncover extends with decreasing pressure over\n\n100 km. We should also note that the sea level\n\natmospheric pressure is not always 760 mm of\n\nHg. A drop in the Hg level by 10 mm or more is a\n\nsign of an approaching storm. t\n\nExample 10.4 At a depth of 1000 m in an\nocean (a) what is the absolute pressure?\n(b) What is the gauge pressure?

(10.6), absolute pressure\n\nP =\n \nP\n\na \n+ ρgh\n\n= 1.01 ×  105 Pa\n   + 1.03 ×  103 kg m–3  × 10 m s–2 ×  1000 m\n=  104.01 ×  105 Pa\n≈  104 atm\n\n(b) Gauge pressure is P −\n \nP\n\na \n= ρgh = P\n\ng\n\nP\ng\n = 1.03 ×  103 kg m–3 ×  10 ms2 ×  1000 m\n\n    = 103 ×  105 Pa\n     ≈ 103 atm\n\n(c) The pressure outside the submarine is\nP =\n\n \nP\n\na \n+ ρgh and the pressure inside it is P\n\na\n.\n\nHence, the net pressure acting on the\nwindow is gauge pressure, P\n\ng\n = ρgh. Since\n\nthe area of the window is A = 0.04 m2, the\nforce acting on it is\nF = P\n\ng\n A = 103 ×  105 Pa ×  0.04 m2 = 4.12 ×  105 N\n\n  t\n\n10.2.4  Hydraulic Machines\n\nLet us now consider what happens when we\nchange the pressure on a fluid contained in a\nvessel. Consider a horizontal cylinder with a\n\npiston and three vertical tubes at different\n\npoints [Fig. 10.6 (a)]. The pressure in the\n\nhorizontal cylinder is indicated by the height of\n\nliquid column in the vertical tubes. It is necessarily\n\nthe same in all. If we push the piston, the fluid level\n\nrises in all the tubes, again reaching the same level\nin each one of them.\n\n     This indicates that when the pressure  on the\ncylinder was increased, it was distributed\nuniformly throughout. We can say  whenever\nexternal pressure is applied on any part of a\nfluid contained in a vessel, it is transmitted\nundiminished and equally in all directions.\nThis is another form of the Pascal’s law and it\nhas many applications in daily life.\n\nA number of devices, such as hydraulic lift\nand hydraulic brakes, are based on the Pascal’s\nlaw. In these devices, fluids are used for\ntransmitting pressure. In a hydraulic lift, as\nshown in Fig. 10.6 (b), two pistons are separated\nby the space filled with a liquid. A piston of small\ncross-section A\n\n1\n is used to exert a force F\n\n1\n directly\n\non the liquid. The pressure P = \n1\n\n1\n\nF\n\nA\n is\n\ntransmitted throughout the liquid to the larger\ncylinder attached with a larger piston of area A\n\n2\n,\n\nwhich results in an upward force of P × A\n2\n.\n\nTherefore, the piston is capable of supporting a\nlarge force (large weight of, say a car, or a truck,\n\nArchemedes’ Principle\nFluid appears to provide partial support to the objects placed in it.  When a body is wholly or partially\nimmersed in a fluid at rest, the fluid exerts pressure on the surface of the body in contact with the\nfluid. The pressure is greater on lower surfaces of the body than on the upper surfaces as pressure in\na fluid increases with depth. The resultant of all the forces is an upward force called buoyant force.\nSuppose that a cylindrical body is immersed in the fluid. The upward force on the bottom of the body\nis more than the downward force on its top. The fluid exerts a resultant upward force or buoyant force\n\non the body equal to (P\n2 \n– P\n\n1\n) ×××××      A (Fig. 10.3). We have seen in equation 10.4 that (P\n\n2\n-P\n\n1\n)A = ρghA. Now,\n\nhA is the volume of the solid and  ρhA is the weight of an equivaliant volume of the fluid. (P\n2\n-P\n\n1\n)A = mg.\n\nThus, the upward force exerted is equal to the weight of the displaced fluid.\nThe result holds true irrespective of the shape of the object and here cylindrical object is considered\n\nonly for convenience. This is Archimedes’ principle. For totally immersed objects the volume of the\nfluid displaced by the object is equal to its own volume. If the density of the immersed object is more\nthan that of the fluid, the object will sink as the weight of the body is more than the upward thrust. If\nthe density of the object is less than that of the fluid, it floats in the fluid partially submerged. To\ncalculate the volume submerged, suppose the total volume of the object is V\n\ns\n and  a part V\n\np \nof it is\n\nsubmerged  in the fluid.  Then, the upward force which is the weight of the displaced fluid is ρ\nf\ngV\n\np\n,\n\nwhich must equal the weight of the body; ρ\ns\ngV\n\ns\n = ρ\n\nf\ngV\n\np\nor  ρ\n\ns\n/ρ\n\nf\n = V\n\np\n/V\n\ns \n The apparent weight of the\n\nfloating body is zero.\nThis principle can be summarised as; ‘the loss of weight of a body submerged (partially or fully) in\n\na fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced’.\n\nFig 10.6  (a) Whenever external pressure is applied\n   on any part of a fluid in a vessel, it is\n\nequally transmitted in all directions.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n256 PHYSICS\n\nt\n\nt\n\nplaced on the platform) F\n2 \n\n= PA\n2 \n\n= \n1 2\n\n1\n\nF A\n\nA\n.

When we apply a little force\non the pedal with our foot the master piston\n\nArchimedes was a Greek philosopher, mathematician, scientist and engineer. He\ninvented the catapult and devised a system of pulleys and levers to handle heavy\nloads. The king of his native city Syracuse, Hiero II, asked him to determine if his gold\ncrown was alloyed with some cheaper metal, such as silver without damaging the crown.\nThe partial loss of weight he experienced while lying in his bathtub suggested a solution\n\nto him. According to legend, he ran naked through the streets of Syracuse, exclaiming “Eureka,\neureka!”, which means “I have found it, I have found it!”\n\nArchimedes (287–212 B.C.)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS 257\n\nmoves inside the master cylinder, and the\npressure caused is transmitted through the\nbrake oil to act on a piston of larger area. A large\nforce acts on the piston and is pushed down\nexpanding the brake shoes against brake lining.\nIn this way, a small force on the pedal produces\na large retarding force on the wheel. An\nimportant advantage of the system is that the\npressure set up by pressing pedal is transmitted\nequally to all cylinders attached to the four\nwheels so that the braking effort is equal on\nall wheels.\n\n10.3  STREAMLINE FLOW\n\nSo far we have studied fluids at rest. The study\nof the fluids in motion is known as fluid\ndynamics. When a water tap is turned on slowly,\n\nthe water flow is smooth initially, but loses its\n\nsmoothness when the speed of the outflow is\n\nincreased. In studying the motion of fluids, we\n\nfocus our attention on what is happening to\n\nvarious fluid particles at a particular point in\nspace at a particular time. The flow of the fluid\n\nis said to be steady if at any given point, the\nvelocity of each passing fluid particle remains\n\nconstant in time. This does not mean that the\n\nvelocity at different points in space is same. The\n\nvelocity of a particular particle may change as it\nmoves from one point to another. That is, at some\n\nother point the particle may have a different\n\nvelocity, but every other particle which passes\n\nthe second point behaves exactly as the previous\n\nparticle that has just passed that point. Each\n\nparticle follows a smooth path, and the paths of\nthe particles do not cross each other.\n\nFig. 10.7 The meaning of streamlines. (a) A typical\ntrajectory of a fluid particle.\n\n(b) A region of streamline flow.\n\nThe path taken by a fluid particle under a\nsteady flow is a streamline. It is defined as a\ncurve whose tangent at any point is in the\ndirection of the fluid velocity at that point.\nConsider the path of a particle as shown in\nFig.10.7 (a), the curve describes how a fluid\nparticle moves with time. The curve PQ is like a\npermanent map of fluid flow, indicating how the\nfluid streams. No two streamlines can cross, for\nif they do, an oncoming fluid particle can go\neither one way or the other and the flow would\nnot be steady. Hence, in steady flow, the map of\nflow is stationary in time. How do we draw closely\nspaced streamlines ? If we intend to show\nstreamline of every flowing particle, we would\nend up with a continuum of lines. Consider planes\nperpendicular to the direction of fluid flow e.g.,\nat three points P, R and Q in Fig.10.7 (b). The\nplane pieces are so chosen that their boundaries\nbe determined by the same set of streamlines.\nThis means that number of fluid particles\ncrossing the surfaces as indicated at P, R and Q\nis the same. If area of cross-sections at these\npoints are A\n\nP\n,A\n\nR\n and A\n\nQ\n and speeds of fluid\n\nparticles are v\nP\n, v\n\nR\n and v\n\nQ\n, then mass of fluid\n\n∆m\nP\n crossing at A\n\nP\n in a small interval of time ∆t\n\nis ρ\nP\nA\n\nP\nv\n\nP \n∆t. Similarly mass of fluid ∆m\n\nR\n flowing\n\nor crossing at A\nR\n in a small interval of time ∆t is\n\nρ\nR\nA\n\nR\nv\n\nR \n∆t and mass of fluid  ∆m\n\nQ\n is ρ\n\nQ\nA\n\nQ\nv\n\nQ \n∆t\n\ncrossing at A\nQ\n. The mass of liquid flowing out\n\nequals the mass flowing in, holds in all cases.\nTherefore,\n\nρ\nP\nA\n\nP\nv\n\nP\n∆t = ρ\n\nR\nA\n\nR\nv\n\nR\n∆t = ρ\n\nQ\nA\n\nQ\nv\n\nQ\n∆t (10.9)\n\nFor flow of incompressible fluids\nρ\n\nP\n = ρ\n\nR\n = ρ\n\nQ\n\nEquation (10.9) reduces to\nA\n\nP\nv\n\nP\n = A\n\nR\nv\n\nR\n = A\n\nQ\nv\n\nQ\n(10.10)\n\nwhich is called the equation of continuity and\nit is a statement of conservation of mass in flow\nof incompressible fluids. In general\n\nAv = constant (10.11)\nAv gives the volume flux or flow rate and\n\nremains constant throughout the pipe of flow.\nThus, at narrower portions where the\nstreamlines are closely spaced, velocity\nincreases and its vice versa. From (Fig 10.7b) it\nis clear that A\n\nR  \n> A\n\nQ \nor   v\n\nR\n <  v\n\nQ\n, the fluid is\n\naccelerated while passing from R to Q. This is\nassociated with a change in pressure in fluid\nflow in horizontal pipes.\n\nSteady flow is achieved at low flow speeds.\nBeyond a limiting value, called critical speed,\nthis flow loses steadiness and becomes\nturbulent. One sees this when a fast flowing\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n258 PHYSICS\n\nstream encounters rocks, small foamy\nwhirlpool-like regions called ‘white water\nrapids are formed.\n\nFigure 10.8 displays streamlines for some\ntypical flows. For example, Fig. 10.8(a) describes\na laminar flow where the velocities at different\npoints in the fluid may have dif ferent\nmagnitudes but their directions are parallel.\nFigure 10.8 (b) gives a sketch of turbulent flow.\n\nFig. 10.8 (a) Some streamlines for fluid flow.\n(b) A jet of air striking a flat plate placed\n\nperpendicular to it. This is an example\n\nof turbulent flow.\n\n10.4  BERNOULLI’S PRINCIPLE\n\nFluid flow is a complex phenomenon. But we\ncan obtain some useful properties for steady\nor streamline flows using the conservation\nof energy.\n\nConsider a fluid moving in a pipe of varying\ncross-sectional area. Let the pipe be at varying\nheights as shown in Fig. 10.9. We now suppose\nthat an incompressible fluid is flowing through\nthe pipe in a steady flow. Its velocity must\nchange as a consequence of equation of\ncontinuity. A force is required to produce this\nacceleration, which is   caused by the fluid\nsurrounding it, the pressure must be different\nin different regions. Bernoulli’s equation is a\ngeneral expression that relates the pressure\ndifference between two points in a pipe to both\nvelocity changes (kinetic energy change) and\nelevation (height) changes (potential energy\n\nchange). The Swiss Physicist Daniel Bernoulli\ndeveloped this relationship in 1738.\n\nConsider the flow at two regions 1 (i.e., BC)\nand 2 (i.e., DE). Consider the fluid initially lying\nbetween B and D. In an infinitesimal time\ninterval ∆t, this fluid would have moved. Suppose\nv\n\n1\n is the speed at B and v\n\n2\n at D, then fluid initially\n\nat B has moved a distance v\n1\n∆t to C (v\n\n1\n∆t is small\n\nenough to assume constant cross-section along\nBC). In the same interval ∆t the fluid initially at\nD moves to E, a distance equal to v\n\n2\n∆t. Pressures\n\nP\n1\n and P\n\n2\n act as shown on the plane faces of\n\nareas A\n1\n and A\n\n2\n binding the two regions. The\n\nwork done on the fluid at left end (BC) is W\n1\n =\n\nP\n1\nA\n\n1\n(v\n\n1\n∆t) = P\n\n1\n∆V. Since the same volume ∆V\n\npasses through both the regions (from the\nequation of continuity) the work done by the fluid\nat the other end (DE) is W\n\n2\n = P\n\n2\nA\n\n2\n(v\n\n2\n∆t) = P\n\n2\n∆V or,\n\nthe work done on the fluid is  –P\n2\n∆V. So the total\n\nwork done on the fluid is\nW\n\n1\n – W\n\n2 \n=  (P\n\n1\n− P\n\n2\n) ∆V\n\nPart of this work goes into changing the kinetic\nenergy of the fluid, and part goes into changing\nthe gravitational potential energy. If the density\nof the fluid is ρ and ∆m = ρA\n\n1\nv\n\n1\n∆t = ρ∆V is the\n\nmass passing through the pipe in time ∆t, then\nchange in gravitational potential energy is\n\n∆U = ρg∆V (h\n2 \n\n− h\n1\n)\n\nThe change in its kinetic energy is\n\n∆K = \n\n1\n\n2\n\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ed \uf8f8\n\n ρ ∆V (v\n2\n\n2 − v\n1\n2)\n\nWe can employ the work – energy theorem\n(Chapter 6) to this volume of the fluid and\nthis yields\n\n(P\n1\n− P\n\n2\n) ∆V = \n\n1\n\n2\n\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ed \uf8f8\n\n ρ ∆V (v\n2\n2 − v\n\n1\n2) + ρg∆V (h\n\n2 \n− h\n\n1\n)\n\nWe now divide each term by ∆V to obtain\n\n(P\n1\n− P\n\n2\n) = \n\n1\n\n2\n\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ed \uf8f8\n\n ρ (v\n2\n2 − v\n\n1\n2) + ρg (h\n\n2 \n− h\n\n1\n)\n\nDaniel Bernoulli was a Swiss scientist and mathematician, who along with Leonard\nEuler had the distinction of winning the French Academy prize for mathematics\n10 times. He also studied medicine and served as a professor of anatomy and\nbotany for a while at Basle, Switzerland. His most well-known work was in\nhydrodynamics, a subject he developed from a single principle: the conservation of\nenergy. His work included calculus, probability, the theory of vibrating strings,\n\nand applied mathematics. He has been called the founder of mathematical physics.\n\nDaniel Bernoulli (1700–1782)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS 259\n\nWe can rearrange the above terms to obtain\n\nP\n1 \n+ \n\n1\n\n2\n\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ed \uf8f8\n\n ρv\n1\n2 + ρgh\n\n1\n = P\n\n2\n+ \n\n1\n\n2\n\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ed \uf8f8\n\n ρv\n2\n2 + ρgh\n\n2\n\n (10.12)\nThis is Bernoulli’s equation. Since 1 and 2\n\nrefer to any two locations along the pipeline,\nwe may write the expression in general as\n\n P + \n1\n\n2\n\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ed \uf8f8\n\nρv2 + ρgh = constant (10.13)\n\nFig. 10.9 The flow of an ideal fluid in a pipe of\nvarying cross section. The fluid in a\n\nsection of length v\n1\n∆t moves to the section\n\nof length v\n2\n∆t in time ∆t.\n\nIn words, the Bernoulli’s relation may be\nstated as follows: As we move along a streamline\nthe sum of the pressure (P ), the kinetic energy\n\nper unit volume \nρv2\n\n2\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8\uf8f7  and the potential energy\n\nper unit volume (ρgh) remains a constant.\nNote that in applying the energy conservation\n\nprinciple, there is an assumption that no energy\nis lost due to friction. But in fact, when fluids\nflow, some energy does get lost due to internal\nfriction. This arises due to the fact that in a\nfluid flow, the different layers of the fluid flow\nwith different velocities. These layers exert\nfrictional forces on each other resulting in a loss\nof energy. This property of the fluid is called\nviscosity and is discussed in more detail in a\nlater section. The lost kinetic energy of the fluid\ngets converted into heat energy. Thus,\nBernoulli’s equation ideally applies to fluids with\n\nzero viscosity or non-viscous fluids. Another\n\nrestriction on application of Bernoulli theorem\n\nis that the fluids must be incompressible, as\n\nthe elastic energy of the fluid is also not taken\n\ninto consideration. In practice, it has a large\n\nnumber of useful applications and can help\n\nexplain a wide variety of phenomena for low\n\nviscosity incompressible fluids.  Bernoulli’s\n\nequation also does not hold for non-steady or\n\nturbulent flows, because in that situation\n\nvelocity and pressure are constantly fluctuating\n\nin time.\n\nWhen a fluid is at rest i.e., its velocity is zero\n\neverywhere, Bernoulli’s equation becomes\n\nP\n1\n + ρgh\n\n1\n = P\n\n2\n + ρgh\n\n2\n\n(P\n1\n− P\n\n2\n) = ρg (h\n\n2 \n− h\n\n1\n)\n\nwhich is same as Eq. (10.6).\n\n10.4.1 Speed of Efflux: Torricelli’s Law\n\nThe word efflux means fluid outflow. Torricelli\ndiscovered that the speed of efflux from an open\ntank is given by a formula identical to that of a\nfreely falling body. Consider a tank containing\na liquid of density ρ with a small hole in its side\nat a height y\n\n1\n from the bottom (see Fig. 10.10).\n\nThe air above the liquid, whose surface is at\nheight y\n\n2\n, is at pressure P. From the equation\n\nof continuity [Eq. (10.10)] we have\nv\n\n1 \nA\n\n1\n = v\n\n2 \nA\n\n2\n\nv\nA\n\nA\nv2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n= 1\n\nFig. 10.10 Torricelli’s law. The speed of efflux, v\n1\n,\n\nfrom the side of the container is given by\n\nthe application of Bernoulli’s equation.\n\nIf the container is open at the top to the\n\natmosphere then 1   2  hv g= .\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n260 PHYSICS\n\nIf the cross-sectional area of the tank A\n2\n is\n\nmuch larger than that of the hole (A\n2\n >>A\n\n1\n), then\n\nwe may take the fluid to be approximately at rest\nat the top, i.e., v\n\n2\n = 0. Now, applying the Bernoulli\n\nequation at points 1 and 2 and noting that at\nthe hole P\n\n1\n = P\n\na\n, the atmospheric pressure, we\n\nhave from Eq. (10.12)\n\n2\n1 1 2\n\n1\n\n2\naP  v g y P g y             + ρ + ρ = + ρ\n\nTaking  y\n2\n – y\n\n1\n = h we have\n\n( )2\n2\n\na\n\n1\n\nP P\nv g h     \n\n−\n= +\n\nρ\n(10.14)\n\nWhen P >>P\na \nand 2 g h may be ignored, the\n\nspeed of efflux is determined by the container\npressure. Such a situation occurs in rocket\npropulsion. On the other hand, if the tank is\nopen to the atmosphere, then P  = P\n\na \nand\n\nhgv    21 = (10.15)\n\nThis is also the speed of a freely falling body.\nEquation (10.15) represents Torricelli’s law.\n\n10.4.2 Venturi-meter\n\nThe Venturi-meter is a device to measure the\nflow speed of incompressible fluid. It consists of\na tube with a broad diameter and a small\nconstriction at the middle as shown in\nFig. (10.11). A manometer in the form of a\nU-tube is also attached to it, with one arm at\nthe broad neck point of the tube and the other\nat constriction as shown in Fig. (10.11). The\nmanometer contains a liquid of density ρ\n\nm\n. The\n\nspeed v\n1 \nof the liquid flowing through the tube\n\nat the broad neck area A is to be measured\nfrom equation of continuity Eq. (10.10) the speed\n\nat the constriction becomes 2 1v v=\nA\n\na\n. Then\n\nusing Bernoulli’s equation (Eq.10.12) for (h\n1\n=h\n\n2\n),\n\nwe get\n\nP\n1\n+ \n\n1\n\n2\n ρv\n\n1\n2 = P\n\n2\n+\n\n1\n\n2\n ρv\n\n1\n2 (A/a)2\n\nSo that\n\nP\n1\n- P\n\n2\n = \n\n1\n\n2\n ρv\n\n1\n2 \n\nA\n\na\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8fb\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\n2\n\n1– (10.16)\n\nThis pressure difference causes the fluid in\nthe U-tube connected at the narrow neck to rise\nin comparison to the other arm.

The carburetor of automobile has\na Venturi channel (nozzle) through which air\nflows with a high speed. The pressure is then\nlowered at the narrow neck and the petrol\n(gasoline) is sucked up in the chamber to provide\nthe correct mixture of air to fuel necessary for\ncombustion. Filter pumps or aspirators, Bunsen\nburner, atomisers and sprayers [See Fig. 10.12]\nused for perfumes or to spray insecticides work\non the same principle.\n\nFig. 10.12 The spray gun.

The narrower part has an area\na = 4 mm2. The pressure drop in the artery\nis 24 Pa. What is the speed of the blood in\nthe artery?\n\nAnswer We take the density of blood from Table\n10.1 to be 1.06 ×  103 kg m-3.

(10.17) we obtain\n\nt\n\n10.4.3 Blood Flow and Heart Attack\n\nBernoulli’s principle helps in explaining blood\n\nflow in artery. The artery may get constricted\n\ndue to the accumulation of plaque on its inner\n\nwalls. In order to drive the blood through this\n\nconstriction a greater demand is placed on the\n\nactivity of the heart. The speed of the flow of\n\nthe blood in this region is raised which lowers\n\nthe pressure inside and the artery may\n\ncollapse due to the external pressure. The\n\nheart exerts further pressure to open this\n\nartery and forces the blood through. As the\n\nblood rushes through the opening, the\n\ninternal pressure once again drops due to\n\nsame reasons leading to a repeat collapse.\n\nThis may result in heart attack.\n\n10.4.4 Dynamic Lift\n\nDynamic lift is the force that acts on a body,\n\nsuch as airplane wing, a hydrofoil or a spinning\n\nball, by virtue of its motion through a fluid. In\n\nmany games such as cricket, tennis, baseball,\n\nor golf, we notice that a spinning ball deviates\n\nfrom its parabolic trajectory as it moves through\n\nair. This deviation can be partly explained on\n\nthe basis of Bernoulli’s principle.\n\n(i) Ball moving without spin: Fig. 10.13(a)\n\nshows the streamlines around a\n\nnon-spinning ball moving relative to a fluid.\n\nFrom the symmetry of streamlines it is clear\n\nthat the velocity of fluid (air) above and below\n\nthe ball at corresponding points is the same\n\nresulting in zero pressure difference. The air\n\ntherefore, exerts no upward or downward\n\nforce on the ball.\n\n(ii) Ball moving with spin: A ball which is\n\nspinning drags air along with it. If the\n\nsurface is rough more air will be dragged.\n\nFig 10.13(b) shows  the streamlines of air\n\nfor a ball which is moving and spinning at\n\nthe same time. The ball is moving forward\n\nand relative to it the air is moving\n\nbackwards. Therefore, the velocity of air\n\nabove the ball relative to the ball is larger\n\nand below it is smaller (see Section 10.3).\n\nThe stream lines, thus, get crowded above\n\nand rarified below.\n\nThis difference in the velocities of air results\n\nin the pressure difference between the lower and\n\nupper faces and there is a net upward force on\n\nthe ball. This dynamic lift due to spining is called\n\nMagnus effect.\n\n(a) (b) (c)\n\nFig 10.13 (a) Fluid streaming past a static sphere. (b) Streamlines for a fluid around a sphere spinning  clockwise.\n(c) Air flowing past an aerofoil.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n262 PHYSICS\n\nt\n\nAerofoil or lift on aircraft wing: Figure 10.13\n\n(c) shows an aerofoil, which is a solid piece\n\nshaped to provide an upward dynamic lift when\n\nit moves horizontally through air. The cross-\n\nsection of the wings of an aeroplane looks\n\nsomewhat like the aerofoil shown in Fig. 10.13 (c)\n\nwith streamlines around it. When the aerofoil\n\nmoves against the wind, the orientation of the\n\nwing relative to flow direction causes the\n\nstreamlines to crowd together above the wing\n\nmore than those below it. The flow speed on top\n\nis higher than that below it. There is an upward\n\nforce resulting in a dynamic lift of the wings and\n\nthis balances the weight of the plane. The\n\nfollowing example illustrates this.\n\nExample 10.8 A fully loaded Boeing\n\naircraft has a mass of 3.3 ×  105 kg. Its total\nwing area is 500 m2. It is in level flight with\n\na speed of 960 km/h.

This resistance to fluid motion\n\nis like an internal friction analogous to friction when\n\na solid moves on a surface. It is called  viscosity.\n\nThis force exists when there is relative motion\n\nbetween layers of the liquid. Suppose we consider\n\na fluid  like oil  enclosed between two glass plates\n\nas shown in Fig. 10.14 (a). The bottom plate is fixed\n\nwhile the top plate is moved with a constant\n\nvelocity v relative to the fixed plate. If oil is\n\nreplaced by honey, a greater force is required to\n\nmove the plate with the same velocity. Hence\n\nwe say that honey is more viscous than oil. The\n\nfluid in contact with a surface has the same\n\nvelocity as that of the surfaces. Hence, the layer\n\nof the liquid in contact with top surface moves\n\nwith a velocity v and the layer of the liquid in\n\ncontact with the fixed surface is stationary. The\n\nvelocities of layers increase uniformly from\n\nbottom (zero velocity) to the top layer (velocity\n\nv). For any layer of liquid, its upper layer pulls\n\nit forward while lower layer pulls it backward.\n\nThis results in force between the layers. This\n\ntype of flow is known as laminar. The layers of\n\nliquid slide over one another as the pages of a\n\nbook do when it is placed flat on a table and a\n\nhorizontal force is applied to the top cover. When\n\na fluid is flowing in a pipe or a tube, then  velocity\n\nof the liquid layer along the axis of the tube is\n\nmaximum and  decreases  gradually as we move\n\ntowards the walls where it becomes zero, Fig.\n\n10.14 (b). The velocity on a cylindrical surface\n\nin a tube is constant.\n\nOn account of this motion, a portion of liquid,\n\nwhich at some instant has the shape ABCD, take\n\nthe shape of AEFD after short interval of time\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS 263\n\nt\n\n(∆t). During this time interval the liquid has\nundergone a shear strain of\n\n∆x/l. Since, the strain in a flowing fluid\nincreases with time continuously. Unlike a solid,\n\nhere the stress is found experimentally to depend\n\non ‘rate of change of strain’ or ‘strain rate’ i.e.\n\n∆x/(l ∆t) or v/l instead of strain itself. The\ncoefficient of viscosity (pronounced ‘eta’) for a\n\nfluid is defined as the ratio of shearing stress to\n\nthe strain rate.\n\nη = =\nF A\n\nv l\n\nF l\n\nv A\n\n/\n\n/\n(10.18)\n\nThe SI unit of viscosity is poiseiulle (Pl). Its\n\nother units are N s m-2 or Pa s. The dimensions\n\nof viscosity are [ML-1T-1]. Generally, thin liquids,\n\nlike water, alcohol, etc., are less viscous than\n\nthick liquids, like coal tar, blood, glycerine, etc.\n\nThe coefficients of viscosity for some common\n\nfluids are listed in Table 10.2. We point out two\n\nfacts about blood and water that you may find\n\ninteresting. As Table 10.2 indicates, blood is\n\n‘thicker’ (more viscous) than water. Further, the\n\nrelative viscosity (η/η\nwater\n\n) of blood remains\n\nconstant between 0 \no\nC and 37 \n\no\nC.\n\nThe viscosity of liquids decreases with\n\ntemperature, while it increases in the case of gases.\n\nExample 10.9 A metal block of area 0.10 m2\n\nis connected to a 0.010 kg mass via a string\n\nthat passes over an ideal pulley (considered\n\nmassless and frictionless), as in Fig. 10.15.\n\nA liquid with a film thickness of 0.30 mm\n\nis placed between the block and the table.\n\nWhen released the block moves to the right\n\nwith a constant speed of 0.085 m s-1. Find\n\nthe coefficient of viscosity of the liquid.\n\nAnswer The metal block moves to the right\n\nbecause of the tension in the string. The tension\n\nT is equal in magnitude to the weight of the\n\nsuspended mass m. Thus, the shear force  F  is\n\nF = T = mg = 0.010 kg ×  9.8 m s–2 = 9.8 ×  10-2 N\n\nShear stress on the fluid = F/A = N/m2\n\nStrain rate = \n\nη =\nstress\n\nstrain rate\ns\n\n-1\n\n  = \n\n  = 3.46 × 10-3 Pa s\n  t\n\n(a)\n\nFig. 10.15 Measurement of the coefficient of viscosity\nof a liquid.\n\n(b)\n\nFig 10.14 (a) A layer of liquid sandwiched between\ntwo parallel glass plates, in which the\n\nlower plate is fixed and the upper one is\n\nmoving to the right with velocity v\n(b) velocity distribution for viscous flow in\n\na pipe.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n264 PHYSICS\n\nt\n\nwhere ρ and σ are mass densities of sphere and\nthe fluid, respectively.

Compute\n\nthe viscosity of the oil at 20oC.

As\n\nliquids have no definite shape but have a\n\ndefinite volume, they acquire a free surface when\n\npoured in a container. These surfaces  possess\n\nsome additional  energy. This phenomenon is\n\nknown as surface tension and it is concerned\n\nwith only liquid as gases do not have free\n\nsurfaces.  Let us now understand this\n\nphenomena.\n\nTable10.2 The viscosities of some fluids\n\nFluid T(oC) Viscosity (mPl)\n\nWater 20 1.0\n\n100 0.3\n\nBlood 37 2.7\n\nMachine Oil 16 113\n\n38 34\n\nGlycerine 20 830\n\nHoney – 200\n\nAir 0 0.017\n\n40 0.019\n\n10.5.1 Stokes’ Law\n\nWhen a body falls through a fluid it drags the\n\nlayer of the fluid in contact with it. A relative\n\nmotion between the different layers of the fluid\n\nis set and, as a result, the body experiences a\n\nretarding force. Falling of a raindrop and\n\nswinging of a pendulum bob are some common\n\nexamples of such motion. It is seen that the\n\nviscous force is proportional to the velocity of\n\nthe object and is opposite to the direction of\n\nmotion. The other quantities on which the force\n\nF depends are viscosity η of the fluid and radius\na of the sphere. Sir George G. Stokes (1819–\n\n1903), an English scientist enunciated clearly\n\nthe viscous drag force F as\n\n6F avη= π (10.19)\n\nThis is known as Stokes’ law. We shall not\n\nderive Stokes’ law.\n\nThis law is an interesting example of retarding\n\nforce, which is proportional to velocity. We can\n\nstudy its consequences on an object falling\n\nthrough a viscous  medium. We consider a\n\nraindrop in air. It accelerates initially due to\n\ngravity. As the velocity increases, the retarding\n\nforce also increases. Finally, when viscous force\n\nplus buoyant force becomes equal to the force\n\ndue to gravity, the net force becomes zero and so\n\ndoes the acceleration. The sphere (raindrop) then\n\ndescends with a constant velocity. Thus, in\n\nequilibrium, this terminal velocity v\nt \nis given by\n\n6πηav\nt\n = (4π/3) a3 (ρ-σ)g\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS 265\n\nFig. 10.16 Schematic picture of molecules in a liquid, at the surface and balance of forces.

(c) Balance of attractive (AI and repulsive (R) forces.\n\nterms of this fact. What is the energy required\n\nfor having a molecule at the surface? As\n\nmentioned above, roughly it is half the energy\n\nrequired to remove it entirely from the liquid\n\ni.e., half the heat of evaporation.\n\nFinally, what is a surface? Since a liquid\n\nconsists of molecules moving about, there cannot\n\nbe a perfectly sharp surface. The density of the\n\nliquid molecules drops rapidly to zero around\n\nz = 0 as we move along the direction indicated\n\nFig 10.16 (c) in a distance of the order of a few\n\nmolecular sizes.\n\nand to disperse them far away from each other\n\nin order to evaporate or vaporise, the heat of\n\nevaporation required is quite large. For water it\n\nis of the order of 40 kJ/mol.\n\nLet us consider a molecule near the surface\n\nFig. 10.16(b). Only lower half side of it is\n\nsurrounded by liquid molecules. There is some\n\nnegative potential energy due to these, but\n\nobviously it is less than that of a molecule in\n\nbulk, i.e., the one fully inside. Approximately\n\nit is half of the latter. Thus, molecules on a\n\nliquid surface have some extra energy in\n\ncomparison to molecules in the interior.  A\n\nliquid, thus, tends to have the least surface\n\narea which external conditions permit.\n\nIncreasing surface area requires energy. Most\n\nsurface phenomenon can be understood in\n\n10.6.2 Surface Energy and Surface Tension\n\nAs we have discussed that an extra energy is\n\nassociated with surface of liquids, the creation\n\nof more surface (spreading of surface) keeping\n\nother things like volume fixed requires\n\nadditional energy. To appreciate this, consider\n\na horizontal liquid film ending in bar free to slide\n\nover parallel guides Fig (10.17).\n\n10.6.1 Surface Energy\n\nA liquid stays together because of attraction\n\nbetween molecules. Consider a molecule well\n\ninside a liquid. The intermolecular distances are\n\nsuch that it is attracted to all the surrounding\n\nmolecules [Fig. 10.16(a)]. This attraction results\n\nin a negative potential energy for the molecule,\n\nwhich depends on the number and distribution\n\nof molecules around the chosen one. But the\n\naverage potential energy of all the molecules is\n\nthe same. This is supported by the fact that to\n\ntake a collection of such molecules (the liquid)\n\nFig. 10.17 Stretching a film. (a) A film in equilibrium;\n\n(b) The film stretched an extra distance.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n266 PHYSICS\n\nSuppose that we move the bar by a small\n\ndistance d as shown. Since the area of the\n\nsurface increases, the system now has more\n\nenergy, this means that some work has been\n\ndone against an internal force. Let this internal\n\nforce be F, the work done by the applied force is\n\nF.d = Fd. From conservation of energy, this is\n\nstored as additional energy in the film. If the\n\nsurface energy of the film is S per unit area, the\n\nextra area is 2dl. A film has two sides and the\n\nliquid in between, so there are two surfaces and\n\nthe extra energy is\n\nS (2dl) = Fd (10.21)\n\nOr, S=Fd/2dl = F/2l (10.22)\n\nThis quantity S is the magnitude of surface\n\ntension. It is equal to the surface energy per unit\n\narea of the liquid interface and is also equal to\n\nthe force per unit length exerted by the fluid on\n\nthe movable bar.\n\nSo far we have talked about the surface of one\n\nliquid. More generally, we need to consider fluid\n\nsurface in contact with other fluids or solid\n\nsurfaces. The surface energy in that case depends\n\non the materials on both sides of the surface. For\n\nexample, if the molecules of the materials attract\n\neach other, surface energy is reduced while if they\n\nrepel each other the surface energy is increased.\n\nThus, more appropriately, the surface energy is\n\nthe energy of the interface between two materials\n\nand depends on both of them.\n\nWe make the following observations from\n\nabove:\n\n(i) Surface tension is a force per unit length\n\n(or surface energy per unit area) acting in\n\nthe plane of the interface between the plane\n\nof the liquid and any other substance; it also\n\nis the extra energy that the molecules at the\n\ninterface have as compared to molecules in\n\nthe interior.\n\n(ii) At any point on the interface besides the\n\nboundary, we can draw a line and imagine\n\nequal and opposite surface tension forces S\n\nper unit length of the line acting\n\nperpendicular to the line, in the plane of the\n\ninterface. The line is in equilibrium. To be\n\nmore specific, imagine a line of atoms or\n\nmolecules at the surface. The atoms to the\n\nleft pull the line towards them; those to the\n\nright pull it towards them! This line of atoms\n\nis in equilibrium under tension. If the line\n\nreally marks the end of the interface, as in\n\nFigure 10.16 (a) and (b) there is only the force\n\nS per unit length acting inwards.\n\nTable 10.3 gives the surface tension of various\n\nliquids. The value of surface tension depends\n\non temperature. Like viscosity, the surface\n\ntension of a liquid usually falls with\n\ntemperature.\n\nTable 10.3 Surface tension of some liquids at the\ntemperatures indicated with the\nheats of the vaporisation\n\nLiquid Temp (oC) Surface Heat of\n\nTension vaporisation\n (N/m)  (kJ/mol)\n\nHelium –270 0.000239 0.115\n\nOxygen –183 0.0132 7.1\n\nEthanol 20 0.0227 40.6\n\nWater 20 0.0727 44.16\n\nMercury 20 0.4355 63.2\n\nA fluid will stick to a solid surface if the\n\nsurface energy between fluid and the solid is\n\nsmaller than the sum of surface energies\n\nbetween solid-air, and fluid-air. Now there is\n\nattraction between the solid surface and the\n\nliquid. It can be directly measured\n\nexperimentaly as schematically shown in Fig.\n\n10.18. A flat vertical glass plate, below which a\n\nvessel of some liquid is kept, forms one arm of\n\nthe balance. The plate is balanced by weights\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS 267\n\non the other side, with its horizontal edge just\n\nover water. The vessel is raised slightly till the\n\nliquid just touches the glass plate and pulls it\n\ndown a little because of surface tension. Weights\n\nare added till the plate just clears water.\n\nFig. 10.18 Measuring Surface Tension.\n\nSuppose the additional weight required is W.\n\nThen from Eq. 10.22 and the discussion given\n\nthere, the surface tension of the liquid-air\n\ninterface is\n\nS\nla \n\n= (W/2l) = (mg/2l ) (10.23)\n\nwhere m is the extra mass and l is the length of\n\nthe plate edge. The subscript (la) emphasises\n\nthe fact that the liquid-air interface tension is\n\ninvolved.\n\n10.6.3 Angle of Contact\n\nThe surface of liquid near the plane of contact,\n\nwith another medium is in general curved. The\n\nangle between tangent to the liquid surface at\n\nthe point of contact and solid surface inside the\n\nliquid is termed as angle of contact. It is denoted\n\nby θ. It is different at interfaces of different pairs\nof liquids and solids. The value of θ determines\nwhether a liquid will spread on the surface of a\n\nsolid or it will form droplets on it. For example,\n\nwater forms droplets on lotus leaf as shown in\n\nFig. 10.19 (a) while spreads over a clean plastic\n\nplate as shown in Fig. 10.19(b).\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFig. 10.19 Different shapes of water drops with\ninterfacial tensions (a) on a lotus leaf (b)\n\non a clean plastic plate.\n\nWe consider the three interfacial tensions at\n\nall the three interfaces, liquid-air, solid-air and\n\nsolid-liquid denoted by S\nla\n, S\n\nsa\n and S\n\nsl \n, respectively\n\nas given in Fig. 10.19 (a) and (b). At the line of\n\ncontact, the surface forces between the three media\n\nmust be in equilibrium. From the Fig. 10.19(b) the\n\nfollowing relation is easily derived.\n\nS\nla\n cos θ  +  S\n\nsl\n =  S\n\nsa\n(10.24)\n\nThe angle of contact is an obtuse angle if\n\nS\nsl  \n\n> S\nla\n as in the case of water-leaf interface\n\nwhile it is an acute angle if S\nsl  \n\n< S\nla\n as in the\n\ncase of water-plastic interface. When θ is an\nobtuse angle then molecules of liquids are\n\nattracted strongly to themselves and weakly to\n\nthose of solid, it costs a lot of energy to create a\n\nliquid-solid surface, and liquid then does not\n\nwet the solid. This is what happens with water\n\non a waxy or oily surface, and with mercury on\n\nany surface. On the other hand, if the molecules\n\nof the liquid are strongly attracted to those of\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n268 PHYSICS\n\nthe solid, this will reduce S\nsl\n and therefore,\n\ncos θ may increase or θ may decrease. In this\ncase θ is an acute angle. This is what happens\nfor water on glass or on plastic and for kerosene\n\noil on virtually anything (it just spreads). Soaps,\n\ndetergents and dying substances are wetting\n\nagents. When they are added the angle of\n\ncontact becomes small so that these may\n\npenetrate well and become effective. Water\n\nproofing agents on the other hand are added to\n\ncreate a large angle of contact between the water\n\nand fibres.\n\n10.6.4 Drops and Bubbles\n\nOne consequence of surface tension is that free\n\nliquid drops and bubbles are spherical if effects\n\nof gravity can be neglected. You must have seen\n\nthis especially clearly in small drops just formed\n\nin a high-speed spray or jet, and in soap bubbles\n\nblown by most of us in childhood. Why are drops\n\nand bubbles spherical? What keeps soap\n\nbubbles stable?\n\nAs we have been saying repeatedly, a liquid-\n\nair interface has energy, so for a given volume\n\nthe surface with minimum energy is the one with\n\nthe least area. The sphere has this property.\n\nThough it is out of the scope of this book, but\n\nyou can check that a sphere is better than at\n\nleast a cube in this respect! So, if gravity and\n\nother forces (e.g. air resistance) were ineffective,\n\nliquid drops would be spherical.\n\nAnother interesting consequence of surface\n\ntension is that the pressure inside a spherical\n\ndrop Fig. 10.20(a) is more than the pressure\n\noutside. Suppose a spherical drop of radius r is\n\nin equilibrium. If its radius increase by ∆r. The\nextra surface energy is\n\n[4π(r + ∆r) 2- 4πr2] S\nla\n = 8πr ∆r S\n\nla\n(10.25)\n\nIf the drop is in equilibrium this energy cost is\n\nbalanced by the energy gain due to\n\nexpansion under the pressure difference (P\ni\n – P\n\no\n)\n\nbetween the inside of the bubble and the outside.\n\nThe work done is\n\nW = (P\ni\n – P\n\no\n) 4πr2∆r (10.26)\n\nso that\n\n(P\ni\n – P\n\no\n) = (2 S\n\nla\n/ r) (10.27)\n\nIn general, for a liquid-gas interface, the\n\nconvex side has a higher pressure than the\n\nconcave side. For example, an air bubble in a\n\nliquid, would have higher pressure inside it.\n\nSee Fig 10.20 (b).\n\nFig. 10.20 Drop, cavity and bubble of radius r.\n\nA bubble Fig 10.20 (c) differs from a drop\n\nand a cavity; in this it has two interfaces.\n\nApplying the above argument we have for a\n\nbubble\n\n (P\ni\n – P\n\no\n) = (4 S\n\nla\n/ r) (10.28)\n\nThis is probably why you have to blow hard,\n\nbut not too hard, to form a soap bubble. A little\n\nextra air pressure is needed inside!\n\n10.6.5 Capillary Rise\n\nOne consequence of the pressure difference\n\nacross a curved liquid-air interface is the well-\n\nknown effect that water rises up in a narrow\n\ntube in spite of gravity. The word capilla means\n\nhair in Latin; if the tube were hair thin, the rise\n\nwould be very large. To see this, consider a\n\nvertical capillary tube of circular cross section\n\n(radius a) inserted into an open vessel of water\n\n(Fig. 10.21). The contact angle between water\n\nFig. 10.21 Capillary rise, (a) Schematic picture of a\nnarrow tube immersed water.\n\n(b) Enlarged picture near interface.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS 269\n\nand glass is acute. Thus the surface of water in\n\nthe capillary is concave. This means that\n\nthere is a pressure difference between the\n\ntwo sides of the top surface. This is given by\n\n(P\ni\n – P\n\no\n) =(2S/r) = 2S/(a sec θ )\n\n= (2S/a) cos θ (10.29)\n\nThus the pressure of the water inside the\n\ntube, just at the meniscus (air-water interface)\n\nis less than the atmospheric pressure. Consider\n\nthe two points A and B in Fig. 10.21(a). They\n\nmust be at the same pressure, namely\n\nP\n0\n + h ρ  g = P\n\ni\n = P\n\nA\n(10.30)\n\nwhere ρρρρρ is the density of water and h is called\nthe capillary rise [Fig. 10.21(a)]. Using\n\nEq. (10.29) and (10.30) we have\n\nh ρ  g = (P\ni\n – P\n\n0\n) = (2S cos θ  )/a    (10.31)\n\nThe discussion here, and the Eqs. (10.26) and\n\n(10.27) make it clear that the capillary rise is\n\ndue to surface tension. It is larger, for a smaller\n\na. Typically it is of the order of a few cm for fine\n\ncapillaries. For example, if a = 0.05 cm, using\n\nthe value of surface tension for water (Table\n\n10.3), we find that\n\nh = 2S/(ρ  g a)\n\n  \n\n-1\n\n3 -3 -2 -4\n\n2×(0.073 N m )\n=\n\n(10 kg m ) (9.8 m s )(5 × 10 m)\n\n  = 2.98 ×  10–2 m = 2.98 cm\n\nNotice that if the liquid meniscus is convex,\n\nas for mercury, i.e., if cos θ is negative then from\nEq. (10.30) for example, it is clear that the liquid\n\nwill be lower in the capillary !\n\n10.6.6 Detergents and Surface Tension\n\nWe clean dirty clothes containing grease and oil\n\nstains sticking to cotton or other fabrics by\n\nadding detergents or soap to water, soaking\n\nclothes in it and shaking. Let us understand\n\nthis process better.\n\nWashing with water does not remove grease\n\nstains. This is because water does not wet greasy\n\ndirt; i.e., there is very little area of contact\n\nbetween them. If water could wet grease, the flow\n\nof water could carry some grease away.\n\nSomething of this sort is achieved through\n\ndetergents. The molecules of detergents are\n\nhairpin shaped, with one end attracted to water\nand the other to molecules of grease, oil or wax,\nthus tending to form water-oil interfaces. The result\nis shown in Fig. 10.22 as a sequence of figures.\n\nIn our language, we would say that addition\nof detergents, whose molecules attract at one\nend and say, oil on the other, reduces drastically\nthe surface tension S (water-oil). It may even\nbecome energetically favourable to form such\ninterfaces, i.e., globs of dirt surrounded by\ndetergents and then by water. This kind of\nprocess using surface active detergents or\nsurfactants is important not only for cleaning,\nbut also in recovering oil, mineral ores etc.\n\nFig. 10.22 Detergent action in terms of what\ndetergent molecules do.\n\n.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n270 PHYSICS\n\nt\n\nExample 10.11 The lower end of a capillary\ntube of diameter 2.00 mm is dipped 8.00\ncm below the surface of water in a beaker.\nWhat is the pressure required in the tube\nin order to blow a hemispherical bubble at\nits end in water? The surface tension of\nwater at temperature of the experiments is\n7.30×10-2 Nm-1. 1 atmospheric pressure =\n1.01 × 105 Pa, density of water = 1000 kg/m3,\ng = 9.80 m s-2. Also calculate the excess\npressure.\n\nAnswer The excess pressure in a bubble of gas\nin a liquid is given by 2S/r, where S is the\nsurface tension of the liquid-gas interface. You\nshould note there is only one liquid surface in\nthis case. (For a bubble of liquid in a gas, there\nare two liquid surfaces, so the formula for\n\nexcess pressure in that case is 4S/r.) The\nradius of the bubble is r. Now the pressure\noutside the bubble P\n\no\n equals atmospheric\n\npressure plus the pressure due to 8.00 cm of\nwater column. That is\n\nP\no\n = (1.01 × 105 Pa + 0.08 m × 1000 kg m–3\n\n    × 9.80 m s–2)\n    = 1.01784 × 105 Pa\n\nTherefore, the pressure inside the bubble is\n  P\n\ni \n = P\n\no\n + 2S/r\n\n= 1.01784 × 105 Pa + (2 × 7.3 × 10-2 Pa m/10-3 m)\n= (1.01784 + 0.00146) × 105  Pa\n= 1.02  × 105 Pa\n\nwhere the radius of the bubble is taken\nto be equal to the radius of the capillary tube,\nsince the bubble is hemispherical ! (The answer\nhas been rounded off to three significant\nfigures.) The excess pressure in the\nbubble is 146 Pa. t\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. The basic property of a fluid is that it can flow. The fluid does not have any\n\nresistance to change of its shape. Thus, the shape of a fluid is governed by the\n\nshape of its container.\n\n2. A liquid is incompressible and has a free surface of its own. A gas is compressible\n\nand it expands to occupy all the space available to it.\n\n3. If F is the normal force exerted by a fluid on an area A then the average pressure P\nav\n\nis defined as the ratio of the force to area\n\nA\n\nF\nP\n\nav\n=\n\n4. The unit of the pressure is the pascal (Pa). It is the same as N m-2. Other common\n\nunits of pressure are\n\n1 atm = 1.01×105 Pa\n\n1 bar = 105 Pa\n\n1 torr = 133 Pa = 0.133 kPa\n\n1 mm of Hg = 1 torr = 133 Pa\n\n5. Pascal’s law states that: Pressure in a fluid at rest is same at all points which are at\n\nthe same height. A change in pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted\n\nundiminished to every point of the fluid and the walls of the containing vessel.\n\n6. The pressure in a fluid varies with depth h according to the expression\n\nP = P\na \n+ ρgh\n\nwhere  ρ is the density of the fluid, assumed uniform.\n\n7. The volume of an incompressible fluid passing any point every second in a pipe of\n\nnon uniform crossection is the same in the steady flow.\n\nv A = constant ( v is the velocity and A is the area of crossection)\n\nThe equation is due to mass conservation in incompressible fluid flow.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS 271\n\n8. Bernoulli’s principle states that as we move along a streamline, the sum of the\n\npressure (P), the kinetic energy per unit volume (ρv2/2) and the potential energy per\nunit volume (ρgy) remains a constant.\nP + ρv2/2 + ρgy = constant\n\nThe equation is basically the conservation of energy applied to non viscuss fluid\n\nmotion in steady state. There is no fluid which have zero viscosity, so the above\n\nstatement is true only approximately. The viscosity is like friction and converts the\n\nkinetic energy to heat energy.\n\n9. Though shear strain in a fluid does not require shear stress, when a shear stress is\n\napplied to a fluid, the motion is generated which causes a shear strain growing\n\nwith time. The ratio of the shear stress to the time rate of shearing strain is known\n\nas coefficient of viscosity, η.\n\nwhere symbols have their usual meaning and are defined in the text.\n\n10. Stokes’ law states that the viscous drag force F on a sphere of radius a moving with\n\nvelocity v through a fluid of viscosity is, F = 6πηav.\n\n11. Surface tension is a force per unit length (or surface energy per unit area) acting in\n\nthe plane of interface between the liquid and the bounding surface. It is the extra\n\nenergy that the molecules at the interface have as compared to the interior.\n\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n\n1. Pressure is a scalar quantity. The definition of the pressure as “force per unit area”\nmay give one false impression that pressure is a vector. The “force” in the numerator of\nthe definition is the component of the force normal to the area upon which it is\nimpressed. While describing fluids as a concept, shift from particle and rigid body\nmechanics is required. We are concerned with properties that vary from point to point\nin the fluid.\n\n2.  One should not think of pressure of a fluid as being exerted only on a solid like the\nwalls of a container or a piece of solid matter immersed in the fluid. Pressure exists at\nall points in a fluid. An element of a fluid (such as the one shown in Fig. 10.2) is in\nequilibrium because the pressures exerted on the various faces are equal.\n\n3. The expression for pressure\nP = P\n\na \n+ ρgh\n\nholds true if fluid is incompressible. Practically speaking it holds for liquids, which\nare largely incompressible and hence  is a constant with height.\n\n4. The gauge pressure is the difference of the actual pressure and the atmospheric pressure.\nP – P\n\na \n= P\n\ng\n\nMany pressure-measuring devices measure the gauge pressure. These include the tyre\npressure gauge and the blood pressure gauge (sphygmomanometer).\n\n5. A streamline is a map of fluid flow. In a steady flow two streamlines do not intersect as\nit means that the fluid particle will have two possible velocities at the point.\n\n6. Bernoulli’s principle does not hold in presence of viscous drag on the fluid. The work\ndone by this dissipative viscous force must be taken into account in this case, and P\n\n2\n\n[Fig. 10.9] will be lower than the value given by Eq. (10.12).\n7. As the temperature rises the atoms of the liquid become more mobile and the coefficient\n\nof viscosity, η  falls. In a gas the temperature rise increases the random motion of\natoms and η  increases.\n\n8. Surface tension arises due to excess potential energy of the molecules on the surface\nin comparison to their potential energy in the interior. Such a surface energy is present\nat the interface separating two substances at least one of which is a fluid. It is not the\nproperty of a single fluid alone.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n272 PHYSICS\n\nEXERCISES\n\n10.1 Explain why\n(a) The blood pressure in humans is greater at the feet than at the brain\n(b) Atmospheric pressure at a height of about 6 km decreases to nearly half of\n\nits value at the sea level, though the height of the atmosphere is more than\n100 km\n\n(c) Hydrostatic pressure is a scalar quantity even though pressure is force\ndivided by area.\n\n10.2 Explain why\n(a) The angle of contact of mercury with glass is obtuse, while that of water\n\nwith glass is acute.\n(b) Water on a clean glass surface tends to spread out while mercury on the\n\nsame surface tends to form drops.

This placed a number of demands on the circulatory system. The\nvenous system that returns blood from the lower extremities to the heart underwent changes. You\nwill recall that veins are blood vessels through which blood returns to the heart. Humans and\nanimals such as the giraffe have adapted to the problem of moving blood upward against gravity.\nBut animals such as snakes, rats and rabbits will die if held upwards, since the blood remains in\nthe lower extremities and the venous system is unable to move it towards the heart.\n\nFig. 10.26 Schematic view of the gauge pressures in the arteries in various parts of the human body while\nstanding or lying down. The pressures shown are averaged over a heart cycle.\n\nFigure 10.26 shows the average pressures observed in the arteries at various points in the human body.\nSince viscous effects are small, we can use Bernoulli’s equation, Eq. (10.13),\n\n21\nConstant\n\n2\nP v gy+ ρ + ρ =\n\nto understand these pressure values. The kinetic energy term (ρ  v2/2) can be ignored since the velocities in\nthe three arteries are small (≈  0.1 m s–1) and almost constant. Hence the gauge pressures at the brain P\n\nB\n,\n\nthe heart P\nH\n, and the foot P\n\nF \nare related by\n\nP\nF\n = P\n\nH\n +  ρ g h\n\nH\n = P\n\nB\n + ρ g h\n\nB\n(10.34)\n\nwhere ρ is the density of blood.\nTypical values of the heights to the heart and the brain are h\n\nH\n = 1.3 m and h\n\nB\n = 1.7 m. Taking\n\nρ = 1.06 ×  103 kg m–3 we obtain that P\nF  \n\n= 26.8 kPa (kilopascals) and\n \nP\n\nB\n = 9.3 kPa given that P\n\nH\n = 13.3 kPa.\n\nThus the pressures in the lower and upper parts of the body are so different when a person is standing,\nbut are almost equal when he is lying down. As mentioned in the text the units for pressure more\ncommonly employed in medicine and physiology are torr and mm of Hg. 1 mm of Hg = 1 torr = 0.133 kPa.\nThus the average pressure at the heart is P\n\nH\n = 13.3 kPa = 100 mm of Hg.\n\nThe human body is a marvel of nature. The veins in the lower extremities are equipped with valves,\nwhich open when blood flows towards the heart and close if it tends to drain down. Also, blood is returned\nat least partially by the pumping action associated with breathing and by the flexing of the skeletal muscles\nduring walking. This explains why a soldier who is required to stand at attention may faint because of\ninsufficient return of the blood to the heart. Once he is made to lie down, the pressures become equalized\nand he regains consciousness.\n\nAn instrument called the sphygmomanometer usually measures the blood pressure of humans. It is a\nfast, painless and non-invasive technique and gives the doctor a reliable idea about the patient’s health.\nThe measurement process is shown in Fig. 10.27. There are two reasons why the upper arm is used. First,\nit is at the same level as the heart and measurements here give values close to that at the heart. Secondly,\nthe upper arm contains a single bone and makes the artery there (called the brachial artery) easy to\ncompress. We have all measured pulse rates by placing our fingers over the wrist. Each pulse takes a little\nless than a second. During each pulse the pressure in the heart and the  circulatory  system goes through a\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS 277\n\nmaximum as the blood is pumped by the heart (systolic  pressure) and a minimum as the heart relaxes\n(diastolic pressure). The sphygmomanometer is a device, which measures these extreme pressures. It\nworks on the principle that blood flow in the brachial (upper arm) artery can be made to go from\nlaminar to turbulent by suitable compression. Turbulent flow is dissipative, and its sound can be\npicked up on the stethoscope.\n\nThe gauge pressure in an air sack wrapped around the upper arm is measured using a manometer or a\n\ndial pressure gauge (Fig. 10.27). The pressure in the sack is first increased till the brachial artery is closed.\n\nThe pressure in the sack is then slowly reduced while a stethoscope placed just below the sack is used to\nlisten to noises arising in the brachial artery. When\n\nthe pressure is just below the systolic (peak)\npressure, the artery opens briefly. During this brief\n\nperiod, the blood velocity in the highly constricted\n\nartery is high and turbulent and hence noisy. The\n\nresulting noise is heard as a tapping sound on the\nstethoscope. When the pressure in the sack is\n\nlowered further, the artery remains open for a longer\n\nportion of the heart cycle. Nevertheless, it remains\n\nclosed during the diastolic (minimum pressure)\nphase of the heartbeat. Thus the duration of the\n\ntapping sound is longer. When the pressure in the\nsack reaches the diastolic pressure the artery is\n\nopen during the entire heart cycle. The flow is\n\nhowever, still turbulent and noisy. But instead of a\n\ntapping sound we hear a steady, continuous roar\n\non the stethoscope.\n\nThe blood pressure of a patient is presented as the ratio of systolic/diastolic pressures. For a resting\n\nhealthy adult it is typically 120/80 mm of Hg (120/80 torr). Pressures above 140/90 require medical\n\nattention and advice. High blood pressures may seriously damage the heart, kidney and other organs and\n\nmust be controlled.\n\nFig. 10.27 Blood pressure measurement using the\nsphygmomanometer and stethoscope.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n\n')('status', 200)
