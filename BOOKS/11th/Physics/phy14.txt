Both these motions are\n\nnon-repetitive. We have also learnt about uniform circular\n\nmotion and orbital motion of planets in the solar system. In\n\nthese cases, the motion is repeated after a certain interval of\n\ntime, that is, it is periodic. In your childhood, you must have\n\nenjoyed rocking in a cradle or swinging on a swing. Both\n\nthese motions are repetitive in nature but different from the\n\nperiodic motion of a planet. Here, the object moves to and fro\n\nabout a mean position. The pendulum of a wall clock executes\n\na similar motion. Examples of such periodic to and fro\n\nmotion abound: a boat tossing up and down in a river, the\n\npiston in a steam engine going back and forth, etc. Such a\n\nmotion is termed as oscillatory motion. In this chapter we\n\nstudy this motion.\n\nThe study of oscillatory motion is basic to physics; its\n\nconcepts are required for the understanding of many physical\n\nphenomena. In musical instruments, like the sitar, the guitar\n\nor the violin, we come across vibrating strings that produce\n\npleasing sounds. The membranes in drums and diaphragms\n\nin telephone and speaker systems vibrate to and fro about\n\ntheir mean positions. The vibrations of air molecules make\n\nthe propagation of sound possible. In a solid, the atoms vibrate\n\nabout their equilibrium positions, the average energy of\n\nvibrations being proportional to temperature. AC power\n\nsupply give voltage that oscillates alternately going positive\n\nand negative about the mean value (zero).\n\nThe description of a periodic motion, in general, and\n\noscillatory motion, in particular, requires some fundamental\n\nconcepts, like period, frequency, displacement, amplitude\n\nand phase. These concepts are developed in the next section.\n\n14.1 Introduction\n\n14.2 Periodic and oscillatory\nmotions\n\n14.3 Simple harmonic motion\n\n14.4 Simple harmonic motion\nand uniform circular\nmotion\n\n14.5 Velocity and acceleration\nin simple harmonic motion\n\n14.6 Force law for simple\nharmonic motion\n\n14.7 Energy in simple harmonic\nmotion\n\n14.8 Some systems executing\nsimple harmonic motion\n\n14.9 Damped simple harmonic\nmotion\n\n14.10 Forced oscillations and\nresonance\n\nSummary\n\nPoints to ponder\n\nExercises\n\nAdditional Exercises\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS342\n\n14.2 PERIODIC AND OSCILLATORY MOTIONS\n\nFig. 14.1 shows some periodic motions. Suppose\nan insect climbs up a ramp and falls down, it\ncomes back to the initial point and repeats the\nprocess identically. If you draw a graph of its\nheight above the ground versus time, it would\nlook something like Fig. 14.1 (a). If a child climbs\nup a step, comes down, and repeats the process\nidentically, its height above the ground would\nlook like that in Fig. 14.1 (b). When you play the\ngame of bouncing a ball off the ground, between\nyour palm and the ground, its height versus time\ngraph would look like the one in Fig. 14.1 (c).\nNote that both the curved parts in Fig. 14.1 (c)\nare sections of a parabola given by the Newton’s\nequation of motion (see section 3.6),\n\n21\n\n2\n + gth = ut  for downward motion, and\n\n21\n\n2\n – gth = ut  for upward motion,\n\nwith different values of u in each case. These\nare examples of periodic motion. Thus, a motion\nthat repeats itself at regular intervals of time is\ncalled periodic motion.\n\nFig. 14.1 Examples of periodic motion. The period T\n\nis shown in each case.\n\nVery often, the body undergoing periodic\nmotion has an equilibrium position somewhere\ninside its path. When the body is at this position\nno net external force acts on it. Therefore, if it is\nleft there at rest, it remains there forever. If the\nbody is given a small displacement from the\nposition, a force comes into play which tries to\nbring the body back to the equilibrium point,\ngiving rise to oscillations or vibrations. For\nexample, a ball placed in a bowl will be in\nequilibrium at the bottom. If displaced a little\nfrom the point, it will perform oscillations in the\nbowl. Every oscillatory motion is periodic, but\nevery periodic motion need not be oscillatory.\nCircular motion is a periodic motion, but it is\nnot oscillatory.\n\nThere is no significant difference between\noscillations and vibrations. It seems that when\nthe frequency is small, we call it oscillation (like,\nthe oscillation of a branch of a tree), while when\nthe frequency is high, we call it vibration (like,\nthe vibration of a string of a musical instrument).\n\nSimple harmonic motion is the simplest form\nof oscillatory motion. This motion arises when\nthe force on the oscillating body is directly\nproportional to its displacement from the mean\nposition, which is also the equilibrium position.\nFurther, at any point in its oscillation, this force\nis directed towards the mean position.\n\nIn practice, oscillating bodies eventually\ncome to rest at their equilibrium positions\nbecause of the damping due to friction and other\ndissipative causes.  However, they can be forced\nto remain oscillating by means of some external\nperiodic agency.  We discuss the phenomena of\ndamped and forced oscillations later in the\nchapter.\n\nAny material medium can be pictured as a\ncollection of a large number of coupled\noscillators. The collective oscillations of the\nconstituents of a medium manifest themselves\nas waves. Examples of waves include water\nwaves, seismic waves, electromagnetic waves.\nWe shall study the wave phenomenon in the next\nchapter.\n\n14.2.1 Period and frequency\n\nWe have seen that any motion that repeats itself\nat regular intervals of time is called periodic\nmotion. The smallest interval of time after\nwhich the motion is repeated is called its\nperiod. Let us denote the period by the symbol\nT. Its SI unit is second. For periodic motions,\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nOSCILLATIONS 343\n\nwhich are either too fast or too slow on the scale\nof seconds, other convenient units of time are\nused. The period of vibrations of a quartz crystal\nis expressed in units of microseconds (10–6 s)\nabbreviated as µs. On the other hand, the orbital\nperiod of the planet Mercury is 88 earth days.\nThe Halley’s comet appears after every 76 years.\n\nThe reciprocal of T gives the number of\nrepetitions that occur per unit time. This\nquantity is called the frequency of the periodic\nmotion. It is represented by the symbol ν. The\nrelation between ν and T is\n\nν  = 1/T  (14.1)\n\nThe unit of ν is thus s–1. After the discoverer of\nradio waves, Heinrich Rudolph Hertz (1857–1894),\na special name has been given to the unit of\nfrequency. It is called hertz (abbreviated as Hz).\nThus,\n\n1 hertz  = 1 Hz =1 oscillation per second =1s–1\n\n (14.2)\n\nNote, that the frequency, ν, is not necessarily\nan integer.\n\nu Example 14.1  On an average, a human\nheart is found to beat 75 times in a minute.\nCalculate its frequency and period.\n\nAnswer The beat frequency of heart = 75/(1 min)\n     = 75/(60 s)\n\n                                                    = 1.25 s–1\n\n                                                    = 1.25 Hz\n             The time period T         = 1/(1.25 s–1)\n                                                    = 0.8 s t\n14.2.2   Displacement\nIn section 4.2, we defined displacement of a\nparticle as the change in its position vector. In\n\nthis chapter, we use the term displacement\n\nin a more general sense. It refers to change\n\nwith time of any physical property under\n\nconsideration. For example, in case of rectilinear\nmotion of a steel ball on a surface, the distance\n\nfrom the starting point as a function of time is\n\nits position displacement. The choice of origin\n\nis a matter of convenience. Consider a block\n\nattached to a spring, the other end of the spring\n\nis fixed to a rigid wall [see Fig.14.2(a)]. Generally,\nit is convenient to measure displacement of the\n\nbody from its equilibrium position. For an\n\noscillating simple pendulum, the angle from the\nvertical as a function of time may be regarded\n\nas a displacement variable [see Fig.14.2(b)]. The\nterm displacement is not always to be referred\n\nFig. 14.2(a) A block attached to a spring, the other\n\nend of which is fixed to a rigid wall. The\n\nblock moves on a frictionless surface. The\n\nmotion of the block can be described in\n\nterms of its distance or displacement x\n\nfrom the equilibrium position.\n\nFig.14.2(b) An oscillating simple pendulum; its\nmotion can be described in terms of\n\nangular displacement θ from the vertical.\n\nin the context of position only. There can be\nmany other kinds of displacement variables. The\nvoltage across a capacitor, changing with time\nin an AC circuit, is also a displacement variable.\nIn the same way, pressure variations in time in\nthe propagation of sound wave, the changing\nelectric and magnetic fields in a light wave are\nexamples of displacement in different contexts.\nThe displacement variable may take both\npositive and negative values. In experiments on\noscillations, the displacement is measured for\ndifferent times.\n\nThe displacement can be represented by a\nmathematical function of time. In case of periodic\nmotion, this function is periodic in time. One of\nthe simplest periodic functions is given by\n\n    f (t) = A cos ωt                           (14.3a)\n\nIf the argument of this function, ωt, is\nincreased by an integral multiple of 2π radians,\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS344\n\nthe value of the function remains the same. The\nfunction f (t ) is then periodic and its period, T,\nis given by\n\n    \nω\nπ2\n\n=  T     (14.3b)\n\nThus, the function f (t) is periodic with period T,\n\nf (t) = f (t+T )\n\nThe same result is obviously correct if we\nconsider a sine function, f (t ) = A sin ωt. Further,\na linear combination of sine and cosine functions\nlike,\n\n       f (t )  =  A sin ωt + B cos ωt                 (14.3c)\nis also a periodic function with the same period\nT. Taking,\n\nA = D cos φ  and  B = D sin φ\n\nEq. (14.3c) can be written as,\n\nf (t) = D sin (ωt + φ ) ,                        (14.3d)\n\nHere D and φ are constant given by\n\n2 2 1\nand tanφ =  –D = A + B    \n\nB\n\nA\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\nThe great importance of periodic sine and\ncosine functions is due to a remarkable result\nproved by the French mathematician, Jean\nBaptiste Joseph Fourier (1768–1830): Any\nperiodic function can be expressed as a\nsuperposition of sine and cosine functions\nof different time periods with suitable\ncoefficients.\n\nu Example 14.2   Which of the following\nfunctions of time represent (a) periodic and\n(b) non-periodic motion? Give the period for\neach case of periodic motion [ω is any\npositive constant].\n(i) sin ωt + cos ωt\n(ii) sin ωt + cos 2 ωt + sin 4 ωt\n(iii) e–ωt\n\n(iv) log (ωt)\n\nAnswer\n\n(i) sin ωt + cos ωt is a periodic function, it can\n\nalso be written as 2  sin (ωt + π/4).\n\nNow 2  sin (ωt + π/4)= 2  sin (ωt + π/4+2π)\n\n       = 2  sin [ω (t + 2π/ω) + π/4]\n\nThe periodic time of the function is 2π/ω.\n\n(ii) This is an example of a periodic motion. It\ncan be noted that each term represents a\nperiodic function with a different angular\nfrequency. Since period is the least interval\nof time after which a function repeats its\nvalue, sin ωt has a period T\n\n0\n= 2π/ω ; cos 2 ωt\n\nhas a period π/ω =T\n0\n/2; and sin 4 ωt has a\n\nperiod 2π/4ω = T\n0\n/4. The period of the first\n\nterm is a multiple of the periods of the last\ntwo terms. Therefore, the smallest interval\nof time after which the sum of the three\nterms repeats is T\n\n0\n, and thus, the sum is a\n\nperiodic function with a period 2π/ω.\n\n(iii) The function e–ωt is not periodic, it\ndecreases monotonically with increasing\ntime and tends to zero as t → ∞ and thus,\nnever repeats its value.\n\n(iv) The function log (ωt ) increases\nmonotonically with time t. It, therefore,\nnever repeats its value and is a non-\nperiodic function. It may be noted that as\nt → ∞, log(ωt) diverges to ∞. It, therefore,\ncannot represent any kind of physical\ndisplacement.               t\n\n14.3 SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION\n\nConsider a particle oscillating back and forth\nabout the origin of an x-axis between the limits\n+A and –A as shown in Fig. 14.3. This oscillatory\nmotion is said to be simple harmonic if the\n\nFig. 14.3 A particle vibrating back and forth about\nthe origin of x-axis, between the limits +A\n\nand –A.\n\ndisplacement x of the particle from the origin\nvaries with time as :\n\nx (t) = A cos (ω t + φ ) (14.4)\nwhere A, ω and φ are constants.\n\nThus, simple harmonic motion (SHM) is not\nany periodic motion but one in which\ndisplacement is a sinusoidal function of time.\nFig. 14.4 shows the positions of a particle\nexecuting SHM at discrete value of time, each\ninterval of time being T/4, where T is the period\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nOSCILLATIONS 345\n\nof motion. Fig. 14.5 plots the graph of x versus t,\nwhich gives the values of displacement as a\ncontinuous function of time. The quantities A,\nω and φ which characterize a given SHM have\nstandard names, as summarised in Fig. 14.6.\nLet us understand these quantities.\n\nThe amplitutde A of SHM is the magnitude\nof maximum displacement of the particle.\n[Note, A can be taken to be positive without\nany loss of generality]. As the cosine function\nof time varies from +1 to –1, the displacement\nvaries between the extremes A and – A. Two\nsimple harmonic motions may have same ω\nand φ but different amplitudes A and B, as\nshown in Fig. 14.7 (a).\n\nFig. 14.4 The location of the particle in SHM at the\ndiscrete values t = 0, T/4, T/2, 3T/4, T,\n\n5T/4. The time after which motion repeats\n\nitself is T. T will remain fixed, no matter\n\nwhat location you choose as the initial (t =\n\n0) location. The speed is maximum for zero\n\ndisplacement (at x = 0) and zero at the\n\nextremes of motion.\n\nFig. 14.5 Displacement as a continuous function of\ntime for simple harmonic motion.\n\nFig. 14.7 (b) A plot obtained from Eq. (14.4). The\ncurves 3 and 4 are for φ = 0 and -π/4\nrespectively. The amplitude A is same for\n\nboth the plots.\n\nFig. 14.7 (a) A plot of displacement as a function of\ntime as obtained from Eq. (14.4) with\n\nφ = 0. The curves 1 and 2 are for two\ndifferent amplitudes A and B.\n\nx (t) : displacement x as a function of time t\nA : amplitude\nω : angular frequency\nωt + φ : phase (time-dependent)\nφ : phase constant\n\nFig. 14.6  The meaning of standard symbols\nin Eq. (14.4)\n\nWhile the amplitude A is fixed for a given\nSHM, the state of motion (position and velocity)\nof the particle at any time t is determined by the\nargument (ωt + φ) in the cosine function. This\ntime-dependent quantity, (ωt + φ) is called the\nphase of the motion. The value of plase at t = 0\nis φ and is called the phase constant (or phase\nangle). If the amplitude is known, φ can be\ndetermined from the displacement at t = 0. Two\nsimple harmonic motions may have the same A\nand ω but different phase angle φ, as shown in\nFig. 14.7 (b).\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS346\n\nFinally, the quantity ω can be seen to be\nrelated to the period of motion T. Taking, for\nsimplicity, φ = 0 in Eq. (14.4), we have\n\nx(t ) = A cos ωt   (14.5)\n\nSince the motion has a period T, x (t) is equal to\nx (t + T ). That is,\n\nA cos ωt = A cos ω (t + T )      (14.6)\n\nNow the cosine function is periodic with period\n2π, i.e., it first repeats itself when the argument\nchanges by 2π. Therefore,\n\nω(t + T ) = ωt + 2π\n\nthat is ω = 2π/ T (14.7)\n\nω is called the angular frequency of SHM. Its\nS.I. unit is radians per second. Since the\nfrequency of oscillations is simply 1/T, ω is 2π\ntimes the frequency of oscillation. Two simple\nharmonic motions may have the same A and φ,\nbut different ω, as seen in Fig. 14.8. In this plot\nthe curve (b) has half the period and twice the\nfrequency of the curve (a).\n\nThis function represents a simple harmonic\nmotion having a period T = 2π/ω and a\nphase angle (–π/4) or (7π/4)\n\n(b) sin2 ωt\n= ½ – ½ cos 2 ωt\n\nThe function is periodic having a period\nT = π/ω. It also represents a harmonic\nmotion with the point of equilibrium\n\noccurring at ½ instead of zero.                      t\n\n14.4  SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION AND\nUNIFORM CIRCULAR MOTION\n\nIn this section, we show that the projection of\nuniform circular motion on a diameter of the\ncircle follows simple harmonic motion. A\nsimple experiment (Fig. 14.9) helps us visualise\nthis connection. Tie a ball to the end of a string\nand make it move in a horizontal plane about\na fixed point with a constant angular speed.\nThe ball would then perform a uniform circular\nmotion in the horizontal plane. Observe the\nball sideways or from the front, fixing your\nattention in the plane of motion. The ball will\nappear to execute to and fro motion along a\nhorizontal line with the point of rotation as\nthe midpoint. You could alternatively observe\nthe shadow of the ball on a wall which is\nperpendicular to the plane of the circle. In this\nprocess what we are observing is the motion\nof the ball on a diameter of the circle normal\nto the direction of viewing.\n\nFig. 14.9 Circular motion of a ball in a plane viewed\nedge-on is SHM.\n\nFig. 14.8   Plots of Eq. (14.4) for φ  = 0 for two different\nperiods.\n\nu Example 14.3  Which of the following\nfunctions of time represent (a) simple\nharmonic motion and (b) periodic but not\nsimple harmonic? Give the period for each\ncase.\n(1) sin ωt – cos ωt\n(2) sin2 ωt\n\nAnswer\n(a) sin ωt – cos ωt\n\n= sin ωt – sin (π/2 – ωt)\n= 2 cos (π/4)  sin (ωt – π/4)\n\n                   = √2 sin (ωt – π/4)\n\nFig. 14.10 describes the same situation\nmathematically. Suppose a particle P is moving\nuniformly on a circle of radius A with angular\nspeed ω. The sense of rotation is anticlockwise.\nThe initial position vector of the particle, i.e.,\n\nthe vector OP  at t = 0 makes an angle of φ with\nthe positive direction of x-axis. In time t, it will\ncover a further angle ωt and its position vector\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nOSCILLATIONS 347\n\nwill make an angle of ωt + φ with the +ve\nx-axis. Next, consider the projection of the\nposition vector OP on the x-axis. This will be\nOP′. The position of P′ on the x-axis, as the\nparticle P moves on the circle, is given by\n\nx(t ) =  A cos (ωt + φ )\nwhich is the defining equation of SHM. This\nshows that if P moves uniformly on a circle,\nits projection P′ on a diameter of the circle\nexecutes SHM. The particle P and the circle\non which it moves are sometimes referred to\nas the reference particle and the reference circle,\nrespectively.\n\nWe can take projection of the motion of P on\nany diameter, say the y-axis. In that case, the\ndisplacement y(t) of P′ on the y-axis is given by\n\ny = A sin (ωt + φ )\nwhich is also an SHM of the same amplitude\nas that of the projection on x-axis, but differing\nby a phase of π/2.\n\nIn spite of this connection between circular\n\nmotion and SHM, the force acting on a particle\n\nin linear simple harmonic motion is very\n\ndifferent from the centripetal force needed to\n\nkeep a particle in uniform circular motion.\n\nu Example 14.4   The figure given below\ndepicts two circular motions. The radius\nof the circle, the period of revolution, the\ninitial position and the sense of revolution\nare indicated in the figures. Obtain the\nsimple harmonic motions of the\nx-projection of the radius vector of the\nrotating particle P in each case.\n\nAnswer\n\n(a) At t = 0, OP makes an angle of 45o = π/4 rad\nwith the (positive direction of ) x-axis. After\n\ntime t, it covers an angle t\nT\n\nπ2  in the\n\nanticlockwise sense, and makes an angle\n\nof \n \n\n4\n + \n\n2 ππ\nt\n\nT\n  with the x-axis.\n\nThe projection of OP on the x-axis at time t\nis given by,\n\nx (t) = A cos \n2\n\n + \n4\n\nπ π\n\nT\nt\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\nFor T = 4 s,\n\nx(t) = A cos  \n2\n\n4\n + \n\n4\n\nπ π\nt\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\nwhich is a SHM of amplitude A, period 4 s,\n\nand an initial phase* = \n4\n\nπ\n \n.\n\n* The natural unit of angle is radian, defined through the ratio of arc to radius. Angle is a dimensionless\nquantity. Therefore it is not always necessary to mention the unit ‘radian’ when we use π, its multiples\nor submultiples. The conversion between radian and degree is not similar to that between metre and\n\ncentimetre or mile. If the argument of a trigonometric function is stated without units, it is understood\n\nthat the unit is radian. On the other hand, if degree is to be used as the unit of angle, then it must be\n\nshown explicitly. For example, sin(150) means sine of 15 degree, but sin(15) means sine of 15 radians.\n\nHereafter, we will often drop ‘rad’ as the unit, and it should be understood that whenever angle is\n\nmentioned as a numerical value, without units, it is to be taken as radians.\n\nFig. 14.10\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS348\n\n(b) In this case at t = 0, OP makes an angle of\n\n90o = \n2\n\nπ  with the x-axis.

We find that this\n\nrepresents a SHM of amplitude B, period 30 s,\n\nand an initial phase of \n2\n\nπ\n− . t\n\n14.5 VELOCITY AND ACCELERATION IN\nSIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION\n\nThe speed of a particle v in uniform circular\n\nmotion is its angular speed ω times the radius\nof the circle A.\n\nv = ω A      (14.8)\n\nThe direction of velocity v at a time t is along\nthe tangent to the circle at the point where the\nparticle is located at that instant. From the\ngeometry of Fig. 14.11, it is clear that the velocity\nof the projection particle P′ at time t is\n\nv(t ) = –ωA sin (ωt + φ )              (14.9)\n\nwhere the negative sign shows that v (t) has a\ndirection opposite to the positive direction of\nx-axis. Eq. (14.9) gives the instantaneous\nvelocity of a particle executing SHM, where\ndisplacement is given by Eq. (14.4). We can, of\ncourse, obtain this equation without using\ngeometrical argument, directly by differentiating\n(Eq. 14.4) with respect of t:\n\nd\n( )\n\nd\nv(t) = x t\n\nt\n(14.10)\n\nThe method of reference circle can be similarly\nused for obtaining instantaneous acceleration\nof a particle undergoing SHM. We know that the\ncentripetal acceleration of a particle P in uniform\ncircular motion has a magnitude v2/A or ω2A,\nand it is directed towards the centre i.e., the\ndirection is along PO. The instantaneous\nacceleration of the projection particle P′ is then\n(See Fig. 14.12)\n\na (t)  = –ω2A cos (ωt + φ)\n\n               = –ω2x (t) (14.11)\n\nFig. 14.11 The velocity, v (t), of the particle P′ is the\nprojection of the velocity v  of the\nreference particle, P.\n\nFig. 14.12 The acceleration, a(t), of the particle P′ is\nthe projection of the acceleration a of the\nreference particle P.\n\nEq. (14.11) gives the acceleration of a particle\nin SHM. The same equation can again be\nobtained directly by differentiating velocity v(t)\ngiven by Eq. (14.9) with respect to time:\n\nd\n( ) ( )\n\nd\na t  = v t\n\nt\n(14.12)\n\nWe note from Eq. (14.11) the important\nproperty that acceleration of a particle in SHM\nis proportional to displacement. For x(t) > 0,\na(t) < 0 and for  x(t) < 0, a(t) > 0. Thus, whatever\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nOSCILLATIONS 349\n\nthe value of x between –A and A, the acceleration\na(t) is always directed towards the centre.\nFor simplicity, let us put φ = 0 and write the\nexpression for x (t), v (t) and a(t)\nx(t) = A cos ωt, v(t) = – ω Asin ωt, a(t)=–ω2 A cos ωt\nThe corresponding plots are shown in Fig. 14.13.\nAll quantities vary sinusoidally with time; only\ntheir maxima differ and the different plots differ\nin phase. x varies between –A to A; v(t) varies\nfrom –ωA to ωA and a(t) from –ω2A to ω2A. With\nrespect to displacement plot, velocity plot has a\nphase difference of π/2 and acceleration plot\nhas a phase difference of π.\n\n(b) Using Eq. (14.9), the speed of the body\n= – (5.0 m)(2π s–1) sin [(2π s–1) ×1.5 s\n+ π/4]\n= – (5.0 m)(2π s–1) sin [(3π + π/4)]\n\n       = 10π × 0.707 m s–1\n       = 22 m s–1\n\n(c) Using Eq.(14.10), the acceleration of the\nbody\n\n= –(2π s–1)2 × displacement\n           = – (2π s–1)2 × (–3.535 m)\n           = 140 m s–2 t\n\n14.6 FORCE LAW FOR SIMPLE HARMONIC\nMOTION\n\nUsing Newton’s second law of motion, and the\nexpression for acceleration of a particle\nundergoing SHM (Eq. 14.11), the force acting\non a particle of mass m in SHM is\n\nF (t )  = ma\n\n    = –mω2 x (t )\n\ni.e., F (t )  = –k x (t ) (14.13)\n\nwhere  k = mω2 (14.14a)\n\nor ω =  \nk\n\nm\n(14.14b)\n\nLike acceleration, force is always directed\ntowards the mean position—hence it is sometimes\ncalled the restoring force in SHM. To summarise\nthe discussion so far, simple harmonic motion can\nbe defined in two equivalent ways, either by Eq.\n(14.4) for displacement or by Eq. (14.13) that gives\nits force law. Going from Eq. (14.4) to Eq. (14.13)\nrequired us to differentiate two times. Likewise,\nby integrating the force law Eq. (14.13) two times,\nwe can get back Eq. (14.4).\n\nNote that the force in Eq. (14.13) is linearly\nproportional to x(t). A particle oscillating under\nsuch a force is, therefore, calling a linear\nharmonic oscillator. In the real world, the force\nmay contain small additional terms proportional\nto x2, x3, etc. These then are called non-linear\noscillators.\n\nu Example 14.6 Two identical springs of\nspring constant k are attached to a block\nof mass m and to fixed supports as shown\nin Fig. 14.14. Show that when the mass is\ndisplaced from its equilibrium position on\neither side, it executes a simple harmonic\nmotion. Find the period of oscillations.\n\nFig. 14.13 Displacement, velocity and acceleration of\na particle in simple harmonic motion have\n\nthe same period T, but they differ in phase\n\nu Example 14.5  A body oscillates with SHM\naccording to the equation (in SI units),\n\n     x = 5 cos [2π t + π/4].\n\nAt t = 1.5 s, calculate the (a) displacement,\n(b) speed and (c) acceleration of the body.\n\nAnswer The angular frequency ω of the body\n= 2π s–1 and its time period T = 1 s.\nAt t = 1.5 s\n(a) displacement = (5.0 m) cos [(2π s–1) ×\n\n1.5 s + π/4]\n= (5.0 m) cos [(3π + π/4)]\n= –5.0 × 0.707 m\n= –3.535 m\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS350\n\nFig. 14.14\n\nAnswer Let the mass be displaced by a small\ndistance x to the right side of the equilibrium\nposition, as shown in Fig. 14.15. Under this\n\nsituation the spring on the left side gets\n\nFig. 14.15\n\nelongated by a length equal to x and that on\n\nthe right side gets compressed by the same\n\nlength. The forces acting on the mass are\n\nthen,\n\nF\n1\n   = –k x (force exerted by the spring on\n\nthe left side, trying to pull the\n\nmass towards the mean\n\nposition)\n\nF\n2 \n  =\n\n  \n–k x (force exerted by the spring on\n\nthe right side, trying to push the\n\nmass towards the mean\n\nposition)\n\nThe net force, F, acting on the mass is then\n\ngiven by,\n\nF   = –2kx\n\nHence the force acting on the mass is\n\nproportional to the displacement and is directed\n\ntowards the mean position; therefore, the motion\n\nexecuted by the mass is simple harmonic. The\n\ntime period of oscillations is,\n\nT = 2  \nm\n\n2k\nπ t\n\n14.7 ENERGY IN SIMPLE HARMONIC\nMOTION\n\nBoth kinetic and potential energies of a particle\n\nin SHM vary between zero and their maximum\n\nvalues.\n\nIn section14.5 we have seen that the velocity\n\nof a particle executing SHM, is a periodic\n\nfunction of time. It is zero at the extreme positions\n\nof displacement. Therefore, the kinetic energy (K)\n\nof such a particle, which is defined as\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\nmv =  K\n\n2 2 21\nsin ( + )\n\n2\n= m A  t  ω ω φ\n\n2\n \n\n1\nsin ( + )\n\n2\n\n2\n=  k A t ω φ     (14.15)\n\nis also a periodic function of time, being zero\n\nwhen the displacement is maximum and\n\nmaximum when the particle is at the mean\n\nposition. Note, since the sign of v is immaterial\n\nin K, the period of K is T/2.\n\nWhat is the potential energy (U) of a particle\n\nexecuting simple harmonic motion? In\n\nChapter 6, we have seen that the concept of\n\npotential energy is possible only for conservative\n\nforces. The spring force F = –kx is a conservative\n\nforce, with associated potential energy\n\n21\n\n2\nU = k x (14.16)\n\nHence the potential energy of a particle\nexecuting simple harmonic motion is,\n\nU(x)  =   2\n\n2\n\n1\nx k \n\n         \n2 2\n\n \n1\n\ncos ( + )\n2\n\n= k A t ω φ  (14.17)\n\nThus, the potential energy of a particle\n\nexecuting simple harmonic motion is also\n\nperiodic, with period T/2, being zero at the mean\n\nposition and maximum at the extreme\n\ndisplacements.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nOSCILLATIONS 351\n\nIt follows from Eqs. (14.15) and (14.17) that\n\nthe total energy, E, of the system is,\n\nE  = U + K\n\n2 2 2 2\n  \n\n1 1\ncos ( + ) + sin ( + )\n\n2 2\n=  k A t  k A t ω φ ω φ\n\n2 2 21\ncos ( + ) + sin ( + )\n\n2\n=  k A t t ω φ ω φ\uf8ee \uf8f9\uf8f0 \uf8fb\n\nUsing the familiar trigonometric identity, the\nvalue of the expression in the brackets is unity.\nThus,\n\n21\n\n2\nE =  k A (14.18)\n\nThe total mechanical energy of a harmonic\n\noscillator is thus independent of time as expected\n\nfor motion under any conservative force. The\n\ntime and displacement dependence of the\n\npotential and kinetic energies of a linear simple\n\nharmonic oscillator are shown in\n\nFig. 14.16.\n\nObserve that both kinetic energy and\n\npotential energy in SHM are seen to be always\n\npositive in Fig. 14.16. Kinetic energy can, of\n\ncourse, be never negative, since it is\n\nproportional to the square of speed. Potential\n\nenergy is positive by choice of the undermined\n\nconstant in potential energy. Both kinetic\n\nenergy and potential energy peak twice during\n\neach period of SHM. For x = 0, the energy is\n\nkinetic; at the extremes x = ±A, it is all potential\n\nenergy. In the course of motion between these\n\nlimits, kinetic energy increases at the expense\n\nof potential energy or vice-versa.\n\nu Example 14.7  A block whose mass is 1 kg\nis fastened to a spring. The spring has a\nspring constant of 50 N m–1. The block is\npulled to a distance x = 10 cm from its\nequilibrium position at x = 0 on a frictionless\nsurface from rest at t = 0. Calculate the\nkinetic, potential and total energies of the\nblock when it is 5 cm away from the mean\nposition.\n\nAnswer The block executes SHM, its angular\nfrequency, as given by Eq. (14.14b), is\n\nω =  \nk\n\nm\n\n =  \n50 N m\n\n– 1\n\n1kg\n\n             = 7.07 rad s–1\n\nIts displacement at any time t is then given by,\n\nx(t) = 0.1 cos (7.07t )\n\nTherefore, when the particle is 5 cm away from\nthe mean position, we have\n\n0.05 = 0.1 cos (7.07t )\n\nOr cos (7.07t ) = 0.5 and hence\n\nsin (7.07t )  =\n3\n\n2\n \n\n \n= 0.866\n\nFig. 14.16 Kinetic energy, potential energy and total\nenergy as a function of time [shown in (a)]\n\nand displacement [shown in (b)] of a particle\n\nin SHM. The kinetic energy and potential\n\nenergy both repeat after a period T/2. The\n\ntotal energy remains constant at all t or x.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS352\n\nThen, the velocity of the block at x = 5 cm is\n\n      = 0.1 × 7.07 × 0.866 m s–1\n\n          = 0.61 m s–1\n\nHence the K.E. of the block,\n\n \n2\n\n1\n = 2  vm\n\n           = ½[1kg × (0.6123 m s–1 )2 ]\n\n           = 0.19 J\n\nThe P.E. of the block,\n\n  \n2\n\n1\n = 2x k \n\n           = ½(50 N m–1 × 0.05 m × 0.05 m)\n           = 0.0625 J\n\nThe total energy of the block at x = 5 cm,\n\n           =  K.E. + P.E.\n\n           =  0.25 J\n\nwe also know that at maximum displacement,\nK.E. is zero and hence the total energy of the\nsystem is equal to the P.E. Therefore, the total\nenergy of the system,\n\n          = ½(50 N m–1 ×  0.1 m × 0.1 m )\n\n          = 0.25 J\nwhich is same as the sum of the two energies at\na displacement of 5 cm. This is in conformity\nwith the principle of conservation of energy.   t\n\n14.8   SOME SYSTEMS EXECUTING SIMPLE\nHARMONIC MOTION\n\nThere are no physical examples of absolutely\npure simple harmonic motion. In practice we\ncome across systems that execute simple\nharmonic motion approximately under certain\nconditions. In the subsequent part of this\nsection, we discuss the motion executed by some\nsuch systems.\n\n14.8.1  Oscillations due to a Spring\n\nThe simplest observable example of simple\nharmonic motion is the small oscillations of a\nblock of mass m fixed to a spring, which in turn\nis fixed to a rigid wall as shown in Fig. 14.17.\nThe block is placed on a frictionless horizontal\nsurface. If the block is pulled on one side and is\nreleased, it then executes a to and fro motion\nabout the mean position. Let x = 0, indicate the\nposition of the centre of the block when the\n\nspring is in equilibrium. The positions marked\nas –A and +A indicate the maximum\ndisplacements to the left and the right of the\nmean position. We have already learnt that\nsprings have special properties, which were first\ndiscovered by the English physicist Robert\nHooke. He had shown that such a system when\ndeformed, is subject to a restoring force, the\nmagnitude of which is proportional to the\ndeformation or the displacement and acts in\nopposite direction.  This is known as Hooke’s\nlaw (Chapter 9). It holds good for displacements\nsmall in comparison to the length of the spring.\nAt any time t, if the displacement of the block\nfrom its mean position is x, the restoring force F\nacting on the block is,\n\nF (x)  = –k x     (14.19)\n\nThe constant of proportionality, k, is called\nthe spring constant, its value is governed by the\nelastic properties of the spring. A stiff spring has\nlarge k and a soft spring has small k. Equation\n(14.19) is same as the force law for SHM and\ntherefore the system executes a simple harmonic\nmotion. From Eq. (14.14) we have,\n\n =  ω\nk\n\nm\n   (14.20)\n\nand the period, T, of the oscillator is given by,\n\n  = 2  \nm\n\nT\nk\n\nπ (14.21)\n\nStiff springs have high value of k (spring\nconstant). A block of small mass m attached to\na stiff spring will have, according to Eq. (14.20),\nlarge oscillation frequency, as expected\nphysically.\n\nFig. 14.17 A linear simple harmonic oscillator\nconsisting of a block of mass m attached\n\nto a spring. The block moves over a\n\nfrictionless surface. The box, when pulled\n\nor pushed and released, executes simple\n\nharmonic motion.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nOSCILLATIONS 353\n\nof pendulum. You can also make your own\npendulum by tying a piece of stone to a long\n\nunstretchable thread, approximately 100 cm\n\nlong.  Suspend your pendulum from a suitable\n\nsupport so that it is free to oscillate. Displace\n\nthe stone to one side by a small distance and\n\nlet it go. The stone executes a to and fro motion,\n\nit is periodic with a period of about two seconds.\nWe shall show that this periodic motion is\n\nsimple harmonic for small displacements from\nthe mean position. Consider simple pendulum\n— a small bob of mass m tied to an inextensible\nmassless string of length L. The other end of\n\nthe string is fixed to a rigid support. The bob\n\noscillates in a plane about the vertical line\n\nthrough the support. Fig. 14.18(a) shows this\n\nsystem. Fig. 14.18(b) is a kind of ‘free-body’\n\ndiagram of the simple pendulum showing the\n\nforces acting on the bob.\n\nu  Example 14.8  A 5 kg collar is attached\nto a spring of spring constant 500 N m–1. It\nslides without friction over a horizontal rod.\nThe collar is displaced from its equilibrium\nposition by 10.0 cm and released. Calculate\n(a) the period of oscillation,\n(b) the maximum speed and\n(c) maximum acceleration of the collar.\n\nAnswer  (a) The period of oscillation as given by\nEq.

He observed that the motion of the\nchandelier was periodic. The system is a kind\n\n(a)\n\n (b)\n\nFig. 14.18 (a) A bob oscillating about its mean\nposition. (b) The radial force T-mg cosθ\nprovides centripetal force but no torque\n\nabout the support. The tangential force\n\nmg sinθ provides the restoring torque.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS354\n\nLet θ be the angle made by the string with\nthe vertical. When the bob is at the mean\n\nposition, θ = 0\nThere are only two forces acting on the bob;\n\nthe tension T along the string and the vertical\n\nforce due to gravity (=mg). The force mg can be\n\nresolved into the component mg cosθ along the\nstring and mg sinθ perpendicular to it. Since\nthe motion of the bob is along a circle of length\n\nL and centre at the support point, the bob has\n\na radial acceleration (ω2L) and also a tangental\nacceleration; the latter arises since motion along\n\nthe arc of the circle is not uniform. The radial\n\nacceleration is provided by the net radial force\n\nT –mg cosθ, while the tangential acceleration is\nprovided by mg sinθ. It is more convenient to\nwork with torque about the support since the\n\nradial force gives zero torque. Torque τ about\nthe support is entirely provided by the tangental\n\ncomponent of force\n\nτ =  –L (mg sinθ ) (14.22)\n\nThis is the restoring torque that tends to reduce\nangular displacement — hence the negative\nsign. By Newton’s law of rotational motion,\n\nτ   =  I α (14.23)\n\nwhere I is the moment of inertia of the system\nabout the support and α is the angular\nacceleration. Thus,\n\nI α = –m g sin θ   L (14.24)\n\nOr,\n\nα  =  sin  \nm g L\n  \n\nI\n θ− (14.25)\n\nWe can simplify Eq. (14.25) if we assume that\nthe displacement θ is small. We know that sin θ\ncan be expressed as,\n\nsin  ± ...\n3! 5!\n\n  \nθ θ\n\nθ θ\n3 5\n\n  =  − + (14.26)\n\nwhere θ is in radians.\nNow if θ  is small, sin θ can be approximated\n\nby θ and Eq. (14.25) can then be written as,\n\n α θ  =  −  \nmgL\n\nI\n (14.27)\n\nIn Table 14.1, we have listed the angle θ in\ndegrees, its equivalent in radians, and the value\n\nSHM - how small should the amplitude be?\n\nWhen you perform the experiment to\ndetermine the time period of a simple\npendulum, your teacher tells you to keep\nthe amplitude small. But have you ever\nasked how small is small? Should the\namplitude to 50, 20, 10, or 0.50? Or could it\nbe 100, 200, or 300?\n\nTo appreciate this, it would be better to\nmeasure the time period for different\namplitudes, up to large amplitudes. Of\ncourse, for large oscillations, you will have\nto take care that the pendulum oscillates\nin a vertical plane. Let us denote the time\nperiod for small-amplitude oscillations as\nT (0) and write the time period for amplitude\nθ\n\n0\n as T(θ\n\n0\n) = cT (0), where c is the multiplying\n\nfactor. If you plot a graph of c versus θ\n0\n,\n\nyou will get values somewhat like this:\n\nθ\n0\n\n: 200 450 500 700 900\n\nc : 1.02 1.04 1.05 1.10 1.18\n\nThis means that the error in the time\nperiod is about 2% at an amplitude of 200,\n5% at an amplitude of 500, and 10% at an\namplitude of 700 and 18% at an amplitude\nof 900.\n\nIn the experiment, you will never be able\nto measure T (0) because this means there\nare no oscillations. Even theoretically,\nsin θ  is exactly equal to θ  only for θ  = 0.\nThere will be some inaccuracy for all other\nvalues of θ . The difference increases with\nincreasing θ . Therefore we have to decide\nhow much error we can tolerate. No\nmeasurement is ever perfectly accurate.\nYou must also consider questions like\nthese: What is the accuracy of the\nstopwatch? What is your own accuracy in\nstarting and stopping the stopwatch? You\nwill realise that the accuracy in your\nmeasurements at this level is never better\nthan 5% or 10%. Since the above table\nshows that the time period of the pendulum\nincreases hardly by 5% at an amplitude of\n500 over its low amplitude value, you could\nvery well keep the amplitude to be 50° in\nyour experiments.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nOSCILLATIONS 355\n\nof the function sin θ . From this table it can be\nseen that for θ as large as 20 degrees, sin θ is\nnearly the same as θ expressed in radians.\n\nTable 14.1  sin θθθθθ as a function of angle θθθθθ\n\nEquation (14.27) is mathematically, identical\n\nto Eq. (14.11) except that the variable is angular\n\ndisplacement. Hence we have proved that for\n\nsmall θ, the motion of the bob is simple harmonic.\nFrom Eqs.

Why does it\n\nhappen ? This is because the air drag and the\n\nfriction at the support oppose the motion of the\n\npendulum and dissipate its energy gradually.\n\nThe pendulum is said to execute damped\noscillations. In dampled oscillations, the energy\nof the system is dissipated continuously; but,\n\nfor small damping, the oscillations remain\n\napproximately periodic. The dissipating forces\n\nare generally the frictional forces. To understand\n\nthe effect of such external forces on the motion\n\nof an oscillator, let us consider a system as\nshown in Fig. 14.19. Here a block of mass m\n\nconnected to an elastic spring of spring constant\n\nk oscillates vertically. If the block is pushed down\n\na little and released, its angular frequency of\n\noscillation is ω =\nk\n\nm\n, as seen in Eq. (14.20).\n\nHowever, in practice, the surrounding medium\n(air) will exert a damping force on the motion of\nthe block and the mechanical energy of the\nblock-spring system will decrease. The energy\nloss will appear as heat of the surrounding\nmedium (and the block also) [Fig. 14.19].\n\n(degrees) (radians) sin\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS356\n\nThe damping force depends on the nature of\nthe surrounding medium. If the block is\nimmersed in a liquid, the magnitude of damping\nwill be much greater and the dissipation of\nenergy much faster. The damping force is\ngenerally proportional to velocity of the bob.\n[Remember Stokes’ Law, Eq. (10.19)] and acts\nopposite to the direction of velocity. If the\ndamping force is denoted by F\n\nd\n, we have\n\nF\nd\n  = –b v     (14.30)\n\nwhere the positive constant b depends on\n\ncharacteristics of the medium (viscosity, for\n\nexample) and the size and shape of the block,\n\netc. Eq. (14.30) is usually valid only for small\nvelocity.\n\nWhen the mass m is attached to the spring\n(hung vertically as shown in Fig. 14.19) and\nreleased, the spring will elongate a little and the\nmass will settle at some height. This position,\nshown by O in Fig 14.19, is the equilibrium\nposition of the mass. If the mass is pulled down\nor pushed up a little, the restoring force on the\nblock due to the spring is F\n\nS\n = –kx, where x is\n\nthe displacement* of the mass from its\nequilibrium position. Thus, the total force acting\non the mass at any time t, is F = –kx –bv.\n\nIf a(t) is the acceleration of mass at time t,\nthen by Newton’s Law of Motion applied along\nthe direction of motion, we have\n\nm a(t ) = –k x(t ) – b v(t ) (14.31)\nHere we have dropped the vector notation\n\nbecause we are discussing one-dimensional\n\nmotion.\n\nUsing the first and second derivatives of x (t)\n\nfor v (t) and a (t), respectively, we have\n\n2\nd d\n\ndd\n2\n\nx x\nm  b   k x  0\n\ntt\n     + + = (14.32)\n\nThe solution of Eq. (14.32) describes the\nmotion of the block under the influence of a\ndamping force which is proportional to velocity.\nThe solution is found to be of the form\n\nx(t)  =   A e–b t/2m cos (ω′t + φ ) (14.33)\n\nwhere A  is the amplitude and ω ′ is the angular\nfrequency of the damped oscillator given by,\n\n  \n4m\n\nb\n\nm\n\nk\n'\n\n2\n\n2\n\n   −= ω (14.34)\n\nIn this function, the cosine function has a\n\nperiod 2π/ω′ but the function x(t) is not strictly\nperiodic because of the factor e–b t/2m which\ndecreases continuously with time. However, if the\ndecrease is small in one time period T, the motion\nrepresented by Eq. (14.33) is approximately\nperiodic.\n\nThe solution, Eq. (14.33), can be graphically\nrepresented as shown in Fig. 14.20. We can\nregard it as a cosine function whose amplitude,\nwhich is Ae–b t/2m, gradually decreases with time.\n\n* Under gravity, the block will be at a certain equilibrium position O on the spring; x here represents the\ndisplacement from that position.\n\nFig. 14.20 A damped oscillator is approximately\nperiodic with decreasing amplitude of\n\noscillation. With greater damping,\n\noscillations die out faster.\n\nNow the mechanical energy of the undamped\noscillator is 1/2 kA2. For a damped oscillator,\nthe amplitude is not constant but depends on\ntime. For small damping, we may use the same\nexpression but regard the amplitude as A e–bt/2m.\n\n1\n( )\n\n2\n\n2 –b t/m\nE t    k A  e   = (14.35)\n\nEquation (14.35) shows that the total energy\nof the system decreases exponentially with time.\nNote that small damping means that the\n\ndimensionless ratio \uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n\uf8eb\n \n\nm k\n\nb\nis much less than 1.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nOSCILLATIONS 357\n\nOf course, as expected, if we put b = 0, all\nequations of a damped oscillator in this section\nreduce to the corresponding equations of an\nundamped oscillator.\n\nu Example 14.10   For the damped oscillator\nshown in Fig. 14.19, the mass m of the block\nis 200 g, k = 90 N m–1 and the damping\nconstant b is 40 g s–1. Calculate (a) the\nperiod of oscillation, (b) time taken for its\namplitude of vibrations to drop to half of\nits initial value, and (c) the time taken for\nits mechanical energy to drop to half its\ninitial value.\n\nAnswer (a) We see that km = 90×0.2 = 18 kg N\n\nm–1 = kg2 s–2; therefore km = 4.243 kg s\n–1, and\n\nb = 0.04 kg s–1. Therefore, b is much less than\n\nkm . Hence, the time period T from Eq. (14.34)\n\nis given by\n\n2\nm\n\nT  \nk\n\nπ=\n\n   –1\n0.2 kg\n\n2\n90 N m\n\nπ=  \n\n   =  0.3 s\n\n(b) Now, from Eq. (14.33), the time, T\n1/2\n\n, for the\namplitude to drop to half of its initial value is\ngiven by,\n\nln(1/2)\n\n/2\nT    =\n\n1/2\n\nb m\n\n             \n0.6 39\n\n2 200 s\n40\n\n = × ×\n\n             = 6.93 s\n\n(c) For calculating the time, t\n1/2\n\n, for its\nmechanical energy to drop to half its initial value\nwe make use of Eq. (14.35). From this equation\nwe have,\n\nE (t\n1/2\n\n)/E (0)   =  exp (–bt\n1/2\n\n/m)\n\nOr                  ½   =  exp (–bt\n1/2\n\n/m)\n\n              ln (1/2)  =  –(bt\n1/2\n\n/m)\n\nOr  t\n1/2\n\n  \n–1\n\n0.6 39\n200 g\n\n40 g s\n    \n\n \n= ×\n\n              =  3.46 s\nThis is just half of the decay period for\n\namplitude. This is not surprising, because,\naccording to Eqs. (14.33) and (14.35), energy\ndepends on the square of the  amplitude. Notice\nthat there is a factor of 2 in the exponents of\nthe two exponentials. t\n\n14.10 FORCED OSCILLATIONS\nAND RESONANCE\n\nWhen a system (such as a simple pendulum or\n\na block attached to a spring) is displaced from\n\nits equilibrium position and released, it oscillates\n\nwith its natural frequency ω, and the oscillations\nare called free oscillations. All free oscillations\neventually die out because of the ever present\n\ndamping forces. However, an external agency\n\ncan maintain these oscillations. These are called\n\nforced or driven oscillations. We consider the\ncase when the external force is itself periodic,\n\nwith a frequency ω\nd\n called the driven frequency.\n\nThe most important fact of forced periodic\n\noscillations is that the system oscillates not with\n\nits natural frequency ω, but at the frequency ω\nd\n\nof the external agency; the free oscillations die\n\nout due to damping. The most familiar example\n\nof forced oscillation is when a child in a garden\n\nswing periodically presses his feet against the\n\nground (or someone else periodically gives the\n\nchild a push) to maintain the oscillations.\nSuppose an external force F(t ) of amplitude\n\nF\n0\n that varies periodically with time is applied\n\nto a damped oscillator. Such a force can be\nrepresented as,\n\nF(t )  = F\no\n cos ω\n\nd \nt (14.36)\n\nThe motion of a particle under the combined\naction of a linear restoring force, damping force\nand a time dependent driving force represented\nby Eq. (14.36) is given by,\n\nm a(t ) = –k x(t ) – bv(t ) + F\no\n cos ω\n\nd \nt    (14.37a)\n\nSubstituting d2x/dt2 for acceleration in\nEq. (14.37a) and rearranging it, we get\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS358\n\n2\n\n2\n\nd d\ndd\n\nx xm b kx \ntt\n\n+ + =  F\no\n cos ω\n\nd \nt (14.37b)\n\nThis is the equation of an oscillator of mass\nm on which a periodic force of (angular)\nfrequency ω\n\nd \nis applied. The oscillator, initially,\n\noscillates with its natural frequency ω. When\nwe apply the external periodic force, the\noscillations with the natural frequency die out,\nand then the body oscillates with the (angular)\nfrequency of the external periodic force. Its\ndisplacement, after the natural oscillations die\nout, is given by\n\nx(t )  =  A cos (ω\nd\nt  + φ ) (14.38)\n\nwhere t is the time measured from the moment\nwhen we apply the periodic force.\n\nThe amplitude A is a function of the forced\nfrequency ω\n\nd\n and the natural frequency ω.\n\nAnalysis shows that it is given by\n\n( ){ }2d d\n1/2\n\nF\nA\n\nm b\n\nο\n\nω ω ω2 2 2 2 2\n=\n\n− + (14.39a)\n\nand tan φ =\n–v\n\nx\nd\n\nο\n\nοω\n(14.39b)\n\nwhere m is the mass of the particle and v\n0\n and\n\nx\n0\n are the velocity and the displacement of the\n\nparticle at time t = 0, which is the moment when\nwe apply the periodic force. Equation (14.39)\nshows that the amplitude of the forced oscillator\ndepends on the (angular) frequency of the\ndriving force. We can see a different behaviour\nof the oscillator when ω\n\nd\n is far from ω and when\n\nit is close to ω. We consider these two cases.\n(a) Small Damping, Driving Frequency far\nfrom Natural Frequency : In this case, ω\n\nd \nb will\n\nbe much smaller than m(ω2\n \n–ω2\n\nd\n), and we can\n\nneglect that term. Then Eq. (14.39) reduces to\n\nA\nF\n\nm d\n=\n\n−( )\nο\n\nω ω\n2   2\n\n(14.40)\n\nFig. 14.21 shows the dependence of the\ndisplacement amplitude of an oscillator on the\nangular frequency of the driving force for\ndifferent amounts of damping present in the\nsystem. It may be noted that in all cases the\namplitude is the greatest when ω\n\nd \n/ω = 1. The\n\ncurves in this figure show that smaller the\ndamping, the taller and narrower is the\nresonance peak.\n\nIf we go on changing the driving frequency,\nthe amplitude tends to infinity when it equals\nthe natural frequency. But this is the ideal case\nof zero damping, a case which never arises in a\nreal system as the damping is never perfectly\nzero. You must have experienced in a swing that\nwhen the timing of your push exactly matches\nwith the time period of the swing, your swing\ngets the maximum amplitude. This amplitude\nis large, but not infinity, because there is always\nsome damping in your swing. This will become\nclear in the (b).\n(b) Driving Frequency Close to Natural\n\nFrequency : If ω\nd \n is very close to ω\n\n \n, m (ω2\n\n \n– 2\n\ndω )\nwould be much less than ω\n\nd \nb, for any reasonable\n\nvalue of b, then Eq. (14.39) reduces to\n\nF\nA\n\nο\n\nω\n=\n\nd\nb\n\n(14.41)\n\nThis makes it clear that the maximum\npossible amplitude for a given driving frequency\nis governed by the driving frequency and the\ndamping, and is never infinity. The phenomenon\nof increase in amplitude when the driving force\nis close to the natural frequency of the oscillator\nis called resonance.\n\nIn our daily life, we encounter phenomena\nwhich involve resonance.  Your experience with\n\nb=70g/s\n\nb=140g/s\n\nb=50g/s (least \n\n damping)\n\nFig. 14.21 The displacement amplitude of a forced\noscillator as a function of the angular\nfrequency of the driving force. The\n\namplitude is the greatest at ω\nd \n/ω =1, the\n\nresonance condition. The three curves\ncorrespond to different extents of damping\n\npresent in the system. The curves 1 and\n\n3 correspond to minimum and maximum\ndamping in the system.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nOSCILLATIONS 359\n\nmotion is gradually damped and not sustained.\nTheir frequencies of oscillation gradually\nchange, and ultimately, they oscillate with the\nfrequency of pendulum 1, i.e., the frequency of\nthe driving force but with different amplitudes.\nThey oscillate with small amplitudes. The\nresponse of pendulum 4 is in contrast to this\nset of pendulums. It oscillates with the same\nfrequency as that of pendulum 1 and its\namplitude gradually picks up and becomes very\nlarge. A resonance-like response is seen.\nThis happens because in this the condition for\nresonance is satisfied, i.e. the natural frequency\nof the system coincides with that of the\ndriving force.\n\nWe have so far considered oscillating systems\n\nwhich have just one natural frequency. In\ngeneral, a system may have several natural\n\nfrequencies. You will see examples of such\nsystems (vibrating strings, air columns, etc.) in\nthe next chapter. Any mechanical structure, like\n\na building, a bridge, or an aircraft may have\nseveral possible natural frequencies. An\n\nexternal periodic force or disturbance will set\nthe system in forced oscillation. If, accidentally,\n\nthe forced frequency ω\nd\n happens to be close to\n\none of the natural frequencies of the system,\nthe amplitude of oscillation will shoot up\n\n(resonance), resulting in possible damage. This\nis why, soldiers go out of step while crossing a\n\nbridge. For the same reason, an earthquake will\nnot cause uniform damage to all buildings in\nan affected area, even if they are built with the\n\nsame strength and material. The natural\nfrequencies of a building depend on its height,\n\nother size parameters, and the nature of\nbuilding material. The one with its natural\nfrequency close to the frequency of seismic wave\n\nis likely to be damaged more.\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. The motion that repeats itself is called periodic motion.\n\n2. The period T is the time required for one complete oscillation, or cycle. It is  related to\nthe frequency ν by,\n\nν\n1\n  T =\n\nswings is a good example of resonance. You\nmight have realised that the skill in swinging to\ngreater heights lies in the synchronisation of\nthe rhythm of pushing against the ground with\nthe natural frequency of the swing.\n\nTo illustrate this point further, let us\nconsider a set of five simple pendulums of\nassorted lengths suspended from a common rope\nas shown in Fig. 14.22. The pendulums 1 and 4\nhave the same lengths and the others have\ndifferent lengths. Now, let us set pendulum 1\ninto motion. The energy from this pendulum gets\ntransferred to other pendulums through  the\nconnecting rope and they start oscillating. The\ndriving force is provided through the connecting\nrope. The frequency of this force is the frequency\nwith which pendulum 1 oscillates.  If we observe\nthe response of pendulums 2, 3 and 5, they first\nstart oscillating with their natural frequencies\nof oscillations and different amplitudes, but this\n\nFig. 14.22 Five simple pendulums of different\nlengths suspended from a common\n\nsupport.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS360\n\nThe frequency ν of periodic or oscillatory motion is the number of oscillations per\nunit time. In the SI, it is measured in hertz :\n\n                      1 hertz = 1 Hz = 1 oscillation per second = 1s–1\n\n3. In simple harmonic motion (SHM), the displacement x (t) of a particle from its\nequilibrium position is given by,\n\nx (t)  = A cos (ωt + φ ) (displacement),\n\nin which A\n \n is the amplitude of the displacement, the quantity  (ωt + φ ) is the phase of\n\nthe motion, and φ is the phase constant. The angular frequency ω is related to the\nperiod and frequency of the motion by,\n\n                         \n2\n\n2    \nT\n\nπ\nω πν= = (angular frequency).\n\n4. Simple harmonic motion can also be viewed as the projection of uniform circular\nmotion on the diameter of the circle in which the latter motion occurs.\n\n5. The particle velocity and acceleration during SHM as functions of time are given by,\n\nv (t)  =  –ωA sin (ωt + φ )            (velocity),\n\n                        a (t)  =  –ω2A cos (ωt + φ )\n\n                                = –ω2x (t)                            (acceleration),\n\nThus we see that both velocity and acceleration of a body executing simple harmonic\nmotion are periodic functions, having the velocity amplitude v\n\nm\n=ω A  and acceleration\n\namplitude a\nm \n\n=ω 2A, respectively.\n\n6. The force acting in a simple harmonic motion is proportional to the displacement and\nis always directed towards the centre of motion.\n\n7. A particle executing simple harmonic motion has, at any time, kinetic energy\nK = ½ mv2  and potential energy U = ½ kx2.  If no friction is present the mechanical\nenergy of the system, E = K + U always remains constant even though K and U change\nwith time.\n\n8. A particle of mass m oscillating under the influence of Hooke’s law restoring force\ngiven by F = – k x exhibits simple harmonic motion with\n\nω \nk\n\nm\n= (angular frequency)\n\n2\nm\n\nT \nk\n\nπ= (period)\n\nSuch a system is also called a linear oscillator.\n\n9. The motion of a simple pendulum swinging through small angles is approximately\nsimple harmonic. The period of oscillation is given by,\n\n2\nL\n\nT \ng\n\nπ=\n\n10. The mechanical energy in a real oscillating system decreases during oscillations because\nexternal forces, such as drag, inhibit the oscillations and transfer mechanical energy\nto thermal energy. The real oscillator and its motion are then said to be damped. If the\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nOSCILLATIONS 361\n\ndamping force is given by F\nd\n = –bv, where v is the velocity of the oscillator and b is a\n\ndamping constant, then the displacement of the oscillator is given by,\n\n                                     x (t) = A\n \ne–bt/2m cos (ω′t + φ )\n\nwhere ω′, the angular frequency of the damped oscillator, is given by\n\n                                   \n\n2\n\n2\n \n\n4\n\nbk\n   \n\nm m\nω ′ = −\n\nIf the damping constant is small then ω′ ≈ ω, where ω is the angular frequency of the\nundamped oscillator.

If an external force with angular frequency ω\nd\n acts on an oscillating system with natural\n\nangular frequency ω, the system oscillates with angular frequency ω\nd\n. The amplitude of\n\noscillations is the greatest when\n\n                                    ω\nd\n  =  ω\n\na condition called resonance.\n\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n\n1. The period T is the least time after which motion repeats itself.  Thus, motion repeats\nitself after nT where n is an integer.\n\n2. Every periodic motion is not simple harmonic motion. Only that periodic motion\ngoverned by the force law F = – k x is simple harmonic.\n\n3. Circular motion can arise due to an inverse-square law force (as in planetary motion)\nas well as due to simple harmonic force in two dimensions equal to: –mω2r.  In the\nlatter case, the phases of motion, in two perpendicular directions (x and y) must differ\n\nby π/2. Thus, for example, a particle subject to a force  –mω2r with initial position (0,\nA) and velocity (ωA, 0) will move uniformly in a circle of radius A.\n\n4. For linear simple harmonic motion with a given ω, two initial conditions are necessary\nand sufficient to determine the motion completely.  The  initial  conditions may be (i)\ninitial position and initial velocity or (ii) amplitude and phase or (iii) energy\nand phase.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS362\n\n5. From point 4 above, given  amplitude or energy, phase of motion is determined by the\ninitial position or initial velocity.\n\n6. A combination of two simple harmonic motions with arbitrary amplitudes and phases\nis not necessarily periodic.  It is periodic only if frequency of one motion is an integral\nmultiple of the other’s frequency.  However, a periodic motion can always be expressed\nas a sum of infinite number of harmonic motions with appropriate amplitudes.\n\n7. The period of SHM does not depend on amplitude or energy or the phase constant.\nContrast this with the periods of planetary orbits under gravitation (Kepler’s third\nlaw).\n\n8. The motion of a simple pendulum is simple harmonic for small angular displacement.\n\n9. For motion of a particle to be simple harmonic, its displacement x must be expressible\nin either of the following forms :\n\nx = A cos ωt  +  B sin ωt\n\nx = A cos (ωt + α ), x =  B sin (ωt + β )\n\nThe three forms are completely equivalent (any one can be expressed in terms of any\nother two forms).\n\nThus, damped simple harmonic motion [Eq. (14.31)] is not strictly simple harmonic. It\nis approximately so only for time intervals much less than 2m/b where b is the damping\nconstant.\n\n10. In forced oscillations, the steady state motion of the particle (after the forced oscillations\ndie out) is simple harmonic motion whose frequency is the frequency of the driving\nfrequency ω\n\nd\n, not the natural frequency ω of the particle.\n\n11. In the ideal case of zero damping, the amplitude of simple harmonic motion at resonance\nis infinite. Since all real systems have some damping, however small, this situation is\nnever observed.\n\n12. Under forced oscillation, the phase of harmonic motion of the particle differs from the\nphase of the driving force.\n\nExercises\n\n14.1 Which of the following examples represent periodic motion?\n(a) A swimmer completing one (return) trip from one bank of a river to the other\n\nand back.\n(b) A freely suspended bar magnet displaced from its N-S direction and released.\n(c) A hydrogen molecule rotating about its centre of mass.\n(d) An arrow released from a bow.\n\n14.2 Which of the following examples represent (nearly) simple harmonic motion and\nwhich represent periodic but not simple harmonic motion?\n(a) the rotation of earth about its axis.\n(b) motion of an oscillating mercury column in a U-tube.\n(c) motion of a ball bearing inside a smooth curved bowl, when released from a\n\npoint slightly above the lower most point.\n(d) general vibrations of a polyatomic molecule about its equilibrium position.\n\n14.3 Fig. 14.23 depicts four x-t plots for linear motion of a particle.
