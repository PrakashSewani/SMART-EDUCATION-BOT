The night sky with its bright celestial objects has\nfascinated humans since time immemorial. The regular\nrepetitions of the day and night, the annual cycle of seasons,\nthe eclipses, the tides, the volcanoes, the rainbow have always\nbeen a source of wonder. The world has an astonishing variety\nof materials and a bewildering diversity of life and behaviour.\nThe inquiring and imaginative human mind has responded\nto the wonder and awe of nature in different ways. One kind\nof response from the earliest times has been to observe the\nphysical environment carefully, look for any meaningful\npatterns and relations in natural phenomena, and build and\nuse new tools to interact with nature.  This human endeavour\nled, in course of time, to modern science and technology.\n\nThe word Science originates from the Latin verb Scientia\nmeaning ‘to know’.  The Sanskrit word Vijñãn and the Arabic\nword Ilm convey similar meaning, namely ‘knowledge’.\nScience, in a broad sense, is as old as human species. The\nearly civilisations of Egypt, India, China, Greece, Mesopotamia\nand many others made vital contributions to its progress.\nFrom the sixteenth century onwards, great strides were made\nin science in Europe. By the middle of the twentieth century,\nscience had become a truly international enterprise, with\nmany cultures and countries contributing to its rapid growth.\n\nWhat is Science and what is the so-called Scientific\nMethod?  Science is a systematic attempt to understand\nnatural phenomena in as much detail and depth as possible,\nand use the knowledge so gained to predict, modify and\ncontrol phenomena. Science is exploring, experimenting and\npredicting from what we see around us. The curiosity to learn\nabout the world, unravelling the secrets of nature is the first\nstep towards the discovery of science. The scientific method\ninvolves several interconnected steps : Systematic\nobservations, controlled experiments, qualitative and\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nPHYSICAL WORLD\n\n1.1 What is physics ?\n\n1.2 Scope and excitement of\nphysics\n\n1.3 Physics, technology and\nsociety\n\n1.4 Fundamental forces in\nnature\n\n1.5 Nature of physical laws\n\nSummary\n\nExercises\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS2\n\nquantitative reasoning, mathematical\nmodelling, prediction and verification or\nfalsification of theories. Speculation and\nconjecture also have a place in science; but\nultimately, a scientific theory, to be acceptable,\nmust be verified by relevant observations  or\nexperiments. There is much philosophical\ndebate about the nature and method of science\nthat we need not discuss here.\n\nThe interplay of theory and observation (or\nexperiment) is basic to the progress of science.\nScience is ever dynamic. There is no ‘final’\ntheory in science and no unquestioned\nauthority among scientists.  As observations\nimprove in detail and precision or experiments\nyield new results, theories must account for\nthem, if necessary, by introducing modifications.\nSometimes the modifications may not be drastic\nand may lie within the framework of existing\ntheory.  For example, when Johannes Kepler\n(1571-1630) examined the extensive data on\nplanetary motion collected by Tycho Brahe\n(1546-1601), the planetary circular orbits in\nheliocentric  theory (sun at the centre of the\nsolar system) imagined by Nicolas Copernicus\n(1473–1543) had to be replaced by elliptical\norbits to fit the data better.  Occasionally,\nhowever, the  existing theory is simply unable\nto explain new observations.  This causes a\nmajor upheaval in science. In the beginning of\nthe twentieth century, it was realised that\nNewtonian mechanics, till then a very\nsuccessful theory, could not explain some of the\nmost basic features of atomic phenomena.\nSimilarly, the then accepted wave picture of light\nfailed to explain the photoelectric effect properly.\nThis led to the development of a  radically new\ntheory (Quantum Mechanics) to deal with atomic\nand molecular phenomena.\n\nJust as a new experiment may suggest an\nalternative theoretical model, a theoretical\nadvance may suggest what to look for in some\nexperiments.  The result of experiment of\nscattering of alpha particles by gold foil, in 1911\nby Ernest Rutherford (1871–1937) established\nthe nuclear model of the atom, which then\nbecame the basis of the quantum theory of\nhydrogen atom given in 1913 by Niels Bohr\n(1885–1962). On the other hand, the concept of\nantiparticle was first introduced theoretically by\nPaul Dirac (1902–1984) in 1930 and confirmed\ntwo years later by the experimental discovery of\npositron (antielectron) by Carl Anderson.\n\nPhysics is a basic discipline in the category\n\nof Natural Sciences, which also includes other\ndisciplines like Chemistry and Biology. The word\n\nPhysics comes from a Greek word meaning\nnature. Its Sanskrit equivalent is Bhautiki that\nis used to refer to the study of the physical world.\n\nA precise definition of this discipline is neither\npossible nor necessary.  We can broadly describe\n\nphysics as a study of the basic laws of  nature\nand their manifestation in different natural\n\nphenomena.  The scope of physics is described\nbriefly in the next section.  Here we remark on\ntwo principal thrusts in physics :  unification\nand reduction.\n\nIn Physics, we attempt to explain diverse\n\nphysical phenomena in terms of a few concepts\nand laws.  The effort is to see the physical world\nas manifestation of some universal laws in\n\ndifferent domains and conditions.  For example,\nthe same law of gravitation (given by Newton)\n\ndescribes the fall of an apple to the ground, the\nmotion of the moon around the earth and the\n\nmotion of planets around the sun. Similarly, the\nbasic laws of electromagnetism (Maxwell’s\nequations) govern all electric and magnetic\n\nphenomena. The attempts to unify fundamental\nforces of nature (section 1.4) reflect this same\n\nquest for unification.\nA related effort is to derive the properties of a\n\nbigger, more complex, system from the properties\n\nand interactions of its constituent simpler parts.\nThis approach is called reductionism and is\nat the heart of physics.  For example, the subject\nof thermodynamics, developed in the nineteenth\ncentury, deals with bulk systems in terms of\n\nmacroscopic quantities such as temperature,\ninternal energy, entropy, etc.  Subsequently, the\n\nsubjects of kinetic theory and statistical\nmechanics interpreted these quantities in terms\n\nof the properties of the molecular constituents\nof the bulk system.  In particular, the\ntemperature was seen to be related to the average\n\nkinetic energy of molecules  of the system.\n\n1.2  SCOPE AND EXCITEMENT OF PHYSICS\n\nWe can get some idea of the scope of physics by\nlooking at its various sub-disciplines.  Basically,\nthere are two domains of interest : macroscopic\nand microscopic. The macroscopic domain\nincludes phenomena at the laboratory, terrestrial\nand astronomical scales. The microscopic domain\nincludes atomic, molecular and nuclear\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICAL WORLD 3\n\nAmpere and Faraday, and encapsulated by\nMaxwell in his famous set of equations. The\nmotion of a current-carrying conductor in a\nmagnetic field, the response of a circuit to an ac\nvoltage (signal), the working of an antenna, the\npropagation of radio waves in the ionosphere, etc.,\nare problems of electrodynamics. Optics deals\nwith the phenomena involving light. The working\nof telescopes and microscopes, colours exhibited\nby thin films, etc., are topics in optics.\nThermodynamics, in contrast to mechanics, does\nnot deal with the motion of bodies as a whole.\nRather, it deals with systems in macroscopic\nequilibrium and is concerned with changes in\ninternal energy, temperature, entropy, etc., of the\nsystem through external work and transfer of\nheat.  The efficiency of heat engines and\nrefrigerators, the direction of a physical or\n\nYou can now see that the scope of physics is\n\ntruly vast.  It covers a tremendous range of\n\nmagnitude of physical quantities like length,\n\nmass, time, energy, etc.  At one end, it studies\n\nphenomena at the very small scale of length\n\n(10\n-14 \n\nm or even less) involving electrons, protons,\n\netc.; at the other end, it deals with astronomical\n\nphenomena at the scale of galaxies or even the\n\nentire universe whose extent is of the order of\n\n10\n26 \n\nm.  The two length scales differ by a factor of\n\n10\n40\n\n or even more.  The range of time scales can\n\nbe obtained by dividing the length scales by the\n\nspeed of light : 10\n–22 \n\ns to 1018\n \ns.  The range of\n\nmasses goes from, say, 10–30 kg  (mass of an\n\nelectron) to 10\n55 \n\nkg (mass of known observable\n\nuniverse). Terrestrial phenomena lie somewhere\n\nin the middle of this range.\n\nFig. 1.1 Theory and experiment go hand in hand in physics and help each other’s progress. The alpha scattering\nexperiments of Rutherford gave the nuclear model of the atom.\n\n* Recently, the domain intermediate between the macroscopic and the microscopic (the so-called mesoscopic\nphysics), dealing with a few tens or hundreds of atoms, has emerged as an exciting  field of  research.\n\nphenomena*. Classical Physics deals mainly\nwith macroscopic phenomena and includes\nsubjects like Mechanics, Electrodynamics,\nOptics and Thermodynamics. Mechanics\nfounded on Newton’s laws of motion and the law\nof gravitation is concerned with the motion (or\nequilibrium) of particles, rigid and deformable\nbodies, and general systems of particles.  The\npropulsion of a rocket by a jet of ejecting gases,\npropagation of water waves or sound waves in\nair, the equilibrium of a bent rod under a load,\netc., are problems of mechanics.  Electrodynamics\ndeals with electric and magnetic phenomena\nassociated with charged and magnetic bodies.\nIts basic laws were given by Coulomb, Oersted,\n\nchemical process, etc., are problems of interest\n\nin thermodynamics.\n\nThe microscopic domain of physics deals  with\n\nthe constitution and structure of matter at the\n\nminute scales of atoms and nuclei (and even\n\nlower scales of length) and their interaction with\n\ndifferent probes such as electrons, photons and\n\nother elementary particles. Classical physics is\n\ninadequate to handle this domain and Quantum\n\nTheory is currently accepted as the proper\n\nframework for explaining microscopic\n\nphenomena.  Overall, the edifice of physics is\n\nbeautiful and imposing and you will appreciate\n\nit more as you pursue the subject.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS4\n\nPhysics is exciting in many ways. To some people\nthe excitement comes from the elegance and\nuniversality of its basic theories, from the fact that\na few basic concepts and laws can explain\nphenomena covering a large range of magnitude\nof physical quantities. To some others, the challenge\nin carrying out imaginative new experiments to\nunlock the secrets of nature, to verify or refute\ntheories, is thrilling.  Applied physics is equally\ndemanding. Application and exploitation of\nphysical laws to make useful devices is the most\ninteresting and exciting part and requires great\ningenuity and persistence of effort.\n\nWhat lies behind the phenomenal progress\nof physics in the last few centuries? Great\nprogress usually accompanies changes in our\nbasic perceptions.  First, it was realised that for\nscientific progress, only qualitative thinking,\nthough no doubt important, is not enough.\nQuantitative measurement is central to the\ngrowth of science, especially physics, because\nthe laws of nature happen to be expressible in\nprecise mathematical equations. The second\nmost important insight was that the basic laws\nof physics are universal — the same laws apply\nin widely different contexts. Lastly, the strategy\nof approximation turned out to be very\nsuccessful.  Most observed phenomena in daily\nlife are rather complicated manifestations of the\nbasic laws. Scientists recognised the importance\nof extracting the essential features of a\nphenomenon from its less significant aspects.\nIt is not practical to take into account all the\ncomplexities of a phenomenon in one go.  A good\nstrategy is to focus first on the essential features,\ndiscover the basic principles and then introduce\ncorrections to build a more refined theory of the\nphenomenon. For example, a stone and a feather\ndropped from the same height do not reach the\nground at the same time. The reason is that the\nessential aspect of the phenomenon, namely free\nfall under gravity, is complicated by the\npresence of air resistance. To get the law of free\nfall under gravity, it is better to create a\nsituation wherein the air resistance is\nnegligible. We can, for example, let the stone and\nthe feather fall through a long evacuated tube.\nIn that case, the two objects will fall almost at\nthe same rate, giving the basic law that\nacceleration due to gravity is independent of the\nmass of the object.  With the basic law thus\nfound, we can go back to the feather, introduce\ncorrections due to air resistance, modify the\nexisting theory and try to build a more realistic\n\nHypothesis, axioms and models\n\nOne should not think that everything can be proved\nwith physics and mathematics. All physics, and also\nmathematics, is based on assumptions, each of\nwhich is variously called a hypothesis or axiom or\npostulate, etc.\n\nFor example, the universal law of gravitation\nproposed by Newton is an assumption or hypothesis,\nwhich he proposed out of his ingenuity. Before him,\nthere were several observations, experiments and\ndata, on the motion of planets around the sun,\nmotion of the moon around the earth, pendulums,\nbodies falling towards the earth etc. Each of these\nrequired a separate explanation, which was more\nor less qualitative. What the universal law of\ngravitation says is that, if we assume that any two\nbodies in the universe attract each other with a\nforce proportional to the product of their masses\nand inversely proportional to the square of the\ndistance between them, then we can explain all\nthese observations in one stroke. It not only explains\nthese phenomena, it also allows us to predict the\nresults of future experiments.\n\nA hypothesis is a supposition without assuming\nthat it is true. It would not be fair to ask anybody\nto prove the universal law of gravitation, because\nit cannot be proved. It can be verified and\nsubstantiated by experiments and observations.\n\nAn axiom is a self-evident truth while a model\nis a theory proposed to explain observed\nphenomena. But you need not worry at this stage\nabout the nuances in using these words. For\nexample, next year you will learn about Bohr’s model\nof hydrogen atom, in which Bohr assumed that an\nelectron in the hydrogen atom follows certain rules\n(postutates). Why did he do that? There was a large\namount of spectroscopic data before him which no\nother theory could explain. So Bohr said that if we\nassume that an atom behaves in such a manner,\nwe can explain all these things at once.\n\nEinstein’s special theory of relativity is also\nbased on two postulates, the constancy of the speed\nof electromagnetic radiation and the validity of\nphysical laws in all inertial frame of reference. It\nwould not be wise to ask somebody to prove that\nthe speed of light in vacuum is constant,\nindependent of the source or observer.\n\nIn mathematics too, we need axioms and\nhypotheses at every stage. Euclid’s statement that\nparallel lines never meet, is a hypothesis. This means\nthat if we assume this statement, we can explain\nseveral properties of straight lines and two or three\ndimensional figures made out of them. But if you\ndon’t assume it, you are free to use a different axiom\nand get a new geometry, as has indeed happened in\nthe past few centuries and decades.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICAL WORLD 5\n\nTable 1.1 Some physicists from different countries of the world and their major contributions\n\ntheory of objects falling to the earth under\ngravity.\n\n1.3  PHYSICS, TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIETY\n\nThe connection between physics, technology\nand society can be seen in many examples. The\ndiscipline of thermodynamics arose from the\nneed to understand and improve the working of\nheat engines.  The steam engine, as we know,\nis inseparable from the Industrial Revolution in\nEngland in the eighteenth century, which had\ngreat impact on the course of human\ncivilisation. Sometimes technology gives rise to\nnew physics; at other times physics generates\nnew technology. An example of the latter is the\nwireless communication technology that followed\nthe discovery of the basic laws of electricity and\nmagnetism in the nineteenth century. The\napplications of  physics are not always easy to\nforesee. As late as 1933, the great physicist\nErnest Rutherford had dismissed the possibility\nof tapping energy from atoms. But only a few\nyears later, in 1938, Hahn and Meitner\ndiscovered the phenomenon of neutron-induced\nfission of uranium, which would serve as the\nbasis of nuclear power reactors and nuclear\nweapons. Yet another important example of\nphysics giving rise to technology is the silicon\n‘chip’ that triggered  the computer revolution in\nthe last three decades of the twentieth century.\n\nA most significant area to which physics has\nand will contribute is the development of\nalternative energy resources.  The fossil fuels of\nthe planet are dwindling fast and there is an\nurgent need to discover new and affordable\nsources of energy.  Considerable progress has\nalready been made in this direction (for\nexample, in conversion of solar energy,\ngeothermal energy, etc., into electricity), but\nmuch more is still to be accomplished.\n\nTable1.1 lists some of the great physicists,\ntheir major contribution and the country of\norigin. You will appreciate from this table the\nmulti-cultural, international character of the\nscientific endeavour.

However, we\nadvise you to read them carefully to develop a feel for some basic aspects of  physics. These are some of the\n\nareas which continue to occupy the physicists today.\n\nof physical laws? We shall now discuss the\nnature of fundamental forces and the laws that\ngovern the diverse phenomena of the physical\nworld.\n\n1.4  FUNDAMENTAL FORCES IN NATURE*\n\nWe all have an intuitive notion of force. In our\nexperience, force is needed to push, carry or\nthrow objects, deform or break them.  We also\nexperience the impact of forces on us, like when\na moving object hits us or we are in a merry-go-\nround. Going from this intuitive notion to the\nproper scientific concept of force is not a trivial\nmatter. Early thinkers like Aristotle had wrong\n\nideas about it.  The correct notion of force was\narrived at by Isaac Newton in his famous laws of\nmotion. He also gave an explicit form for the force\nfor gravitational attraction between two bodies.\nWe shall learn these matters in subsequent\nchapters.\n\nIn the macroscopic world, besides the\ngravitational force, we encounter several kinds\nof forces: muscular force, contact forces between\nbodies, friction (which is also a contact force\nparallel to the surfaces in contact), the forces\nexerted by compressed or elongated springs and\ntaut strings and ropes (tension), the force of\nbuoyancy and viscous force when solids are in\n\nVictor Francis Hess Cosmic radiation Austria\n\nR.A.

There are also forces involving charged\nand magnetic bodies. In the microscopic domain\nagain, we have electric and magnetic forces,\nnuclear forces involving protons and neutrons,\ninteratomic and intermolecular forces, etc.  We\nshall get familiar with some of these forces in later\nparts of this course.\n\nA great insight of the twentieth century\nphysics is that these different forces occurring\nin different contexts actually arise from only a\nsmall number of fundamental forces in nature.\nFor example, the elastic spring force arises due\n\nto the net attraction/repulsion between the\nneighbouring atoms of the spring when the\nspring is elongated/compressed. This net\n\nattraction/repulsion can be traced to the\n(unbalanced) sum of electric forces between the\ncharged constituents of the atoms.\n\nIn principle, this means that the laws for\n‘derived’ forces (such as spring force, friction)\nare not independent of the laws of fundamental\nforces in nature. The  origin of these derived\nforces is, however, very complex.\n\nAt the present stage of our understanding,\nwe know of four fundamental forces in nature,\nwhich are described in brief here :\n\n Table 1.2  Link between technology and physics\n\nTechnology Scientific principle(s)\n\nSteam engine Laws of thermodynamics\n\nNuclear reactor Controlled nuclear fission\n\nRadio and Television Generation, propagation and detection\n\nof electromagnetic waves\n\nComputers Digital logic\n\nLasers Light amplification by stimulated emission of\nradiation\n\nProduction of ultra high magnetic Superconductivity\nfields\n\nRocket propulsion Newton’s laws of motion\n\nElectric generator Faraday’s laws of electromagnetic induction\n\nHydroelectric power Conversion of gravitational potential energy into\nelectrical energy\n\nAeroplane Bernoulli’s principle in fluid dynamics\n\nParticle accelerators Motion of charged particles in electromagnetic\nfields\n\nSonar Reflection of ultrasonic waves\n\nOptical fibres Total internal reflection of light\n\nNon-reflecting coatings Thin film optical interference\n\nElectron microscope Wave nature of electrons\n\nPhotocell Photoelectric effect\n\nFusion test reactor (Tokamak) Magnetic confinement of plasma\n\nGiant Metrewave Radio Detection of cosmic radio waves\nTelescope (GMRT)\n\nBose-Einstein condensate Trapping and cooling of atoms by laser beams and\nmagnetic fields.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS8\n\n1.4.1 Gravitational Force\n\nThe gravitational force is the force of mutual\nattraction between any two objects by virtue of\ntheir masses. It is a universal force. Every object\nexperiences this force due to every other object\nin the universe. All objects on the earth, for\nexample, experience the force of gravity due to\nthe earth. In particular, gravity governs the\nmotion of the moon and artificial satellites around\nthe earth, motion of the earth and planets\naround the sun, and, of course, the motion of\nbodies falling to the earth.  It plays a key role in\nthe large-scale phenomena of the universe, such\nas formation and evolution of stars, galaxies and\ngalactic clusters.\n\n1.4.2  Electromagnetic Force\n\nElectromagnetic force is the force between\ncharged particles.  In the simpler case when\ncharges are at rest, the force is given by\nCoulomb’s law : attractive for unlike charges and\nrepulsive for like charges. Charges in motion\nproduce magnetic effects and a magnetic field\ngives rise to a force on a moving charge. Electric\nand magnetic effects are, in general,\ninseparable – hence the name electromagnetic\nforce. Like the gravitational force,\nelectromagnetic force acts over large distances\nand does not need any intervening medium. It\nis enormously strong compared to gravity. The\n\nelectric force between two protons, for example,\n\nis 10\n36\n\n times the gravitational force between\n\nthem, for any fixed distance.\n\nMatter, as we know, consists of elementary\n\ncharged constituents like electrons and\n\nprotons. Since the electromagnetic force is so\n\nmuch stronger than the gravitational force, it\n\ndominates all phenomena at atomic and\n\nmolecular scales.  (The other two forces, as we\n\nshall see, operate only at nuclear scales.)  Thus\n\nit is mainly the electromagnetic force that\n\ngoverns the structure of atoms and molecules,\n\nthe dynamics of  chemical reactions and the\n\nmechanical, thermal and other properties of\n\nmaterials.  It underlies the macroscopic forces\n\nlike  ‘tension’, ‘friction’, ‘normal force’, ‘spring\n\nforce’, etc.\n\nGravity is always attractive, while\n\nelectromagnetic force can be attractive or\n\nrepulsive.  Another way of putting it is that mass\n\ncomes only in one variety (there is no negative\n\nmass), but charge comes in two varieties :\n\npositive and negative charge. This is what\n\nmakes all the difference.  Matter is mostly\n\nelectrically neutral (net charge is zero). Thus,\n\nelectric force is largely zero and gravitational\n\nforce dominates terrestrial phenomena. Electric\n\nforce manifests itself in atmosphere where the\n\natoms are ionised and that leads to lightning.\n\nAlbert Einstein (1879-1955)\n\nAlbert Einstein, born in Ulm, Germany in 1879, is universally regarded as\none of the greatest physicists of all time. His astonishing scientific career\nbegan with the publication of three path-breaking papers in 1905.  In the\nfirst paper, he introduced the notion of light quanta (now called photons)\nand used it to explain the features of photoelectric effect that the classical\nwave theory of radiation could not account for.  In the second paper, he\ndeveloped a theory of Brownian motion that was confirmed experimentally\na few years later and provided a convincing evidence of the atomic picture of\nmatter. The third paper gave birth to the special theory of relativity that\n\nmade Einstein a legend in his own life time.  In the next decade, he explored the consequences of his\nnew theory which included, among other things, the mass-energy equivalence enshrined in his famous\nequation E = mc2.  He also created the general version of relativity (The General Theory of Relativity),\nwhich is the modern theory of gravitation. Some of Einstein’s most significant later contributions are:\nthe notion of stimulated emission introduced in an alternative derivation of Planck’s blackbody radiation\nlaw, static model of the universe which started modern cosmology, quantum statistics of a gas of\nmassive bosons, and a critical analysis of the foundations of quantum mechanics. The year 2005 was\ndeclared as International Year of  Physics, in recognition of  Einstein’s monumental contribution to\nphysics, in year 1905, describing revolutionary scientific ideas that have since influenced all of modern\nphysics.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICAL WORLD 9\n\nIf we reflect a little, the enormous strength\nof the electromagnetic force compared to\ngravity is evident in our daily life.  When we\nhold a book in our hand, we are balancing the\ngravitational force on the book due to the huge\nmass of the earth by the ‘normal force’\nprovided by our hand.  The latter is nothing\nbut the net electromagnetic force between the\ncharged constituents of our hand and\nthe book, at the surface in contact. If\nelectromagnetic force were not intrinsically so\nmuch stronger than gravity, the hand of the\nstrongest man would crumble under the\nweight of a feather ! Indeed, to be consistent,\nin that circumstance, we ourselves would\ncrumble under our own weight !\n\n1.4.3  Strong Nuclear Force\n\nThe strong nuclear force binds protons and\nneutrons in a nucleus. It is evident that without\nsome attractive force, a nucleus will be\nunstable due to the electric repulsion between\nits protons. This attractive force cannot be\ngravitational since force of gravity is negligible\ncompared to the electric force. A new basic force\nmust, therefore, be  invoked. The strong nuclear\nforce  is  the strongest of all fundamental forces,\nabout 100 times the electromagnetic force in\n\nstrength.  It is charge-independent and acts\nequally between a proton and a proton, a\nneutron and a neutron, and a proton and a\nneutron. Its range is, however, extremely small,\nof about nuclear dimensions (10\n\n–15\nm). It is\n\nresponsible for the stability of nuclei. The\nelectron, it must be noted, does not experience\nthis force.\n\nRecent developments have, however,\nindicated that protons and neutrons are built\nout of still more elementary constituents called\nquarks.\n\n1.4.4  Weak Nuclear Force\n\nThe weak nuclear force appears only in certain\n\nnuclear processes such as the β-decay of a\n\nnucleus. In β-decay, the nucleus emits an\n\nelectron and an uncharged particle called\n\nneutrino.  The weak nuclear force is not as weak\n\nas the gravitational force, but much weaker\n\nthan the strong nuclear and electromagnetic\n\nforces. The range of weak nuclear force is\n\nexceedingly small, of the order of 10\n–16 \n\nm.\n\n1.4.5  Towards Unification of  Forces\n\nWe remarked in section 1.1 that unification is a\nbasic quest in physics. Great advances in\nphysics often amount to unification of different\n\nSatyendranath Bose (1894-1974)\n\nSatyendranath Bose, born in Calcutta in 1894, is among the great Indian\nphysicists who made a fundamental contribution to the advance of science\nin the twentieth century. An outstanding student throughout, Bose started\nhis career in 1916 as a lecturer in physics in Calcutta University; five years\nlater he joined Dacca University.  Here in 1924, in a brilliant flash of insight,\nBose gave a new derivation of Planck’s law, treating radiation as a gas of\nphotons and employing new statistical methods of counting of photon states.\nHe wrote a short paper on the subject and sent it to Einstein who\nimmediately recognised its great significance, translated it in German and\nforwarded it for publication.  Einstein then applied the same method to a\n\ngas of molecules.\nThe key new conceptual ingredient in Bose’s work was that the particles were regarded as\n\nindistinguishable, a radical departure from the assumption that underlies the classical Maxwell-\nBoltzmann statistics. It was soon realised that the new Bose-Einstein statistics was applicable to\nparticles with integers spins, and a new quantum statistics (Fermi-Dirac statistics) was needed for\nparticles with half integers spins satisfying Pauli’s exclusion principle. Particles with integers spins\nare now known as bosons in honour of Bose.\n\nAn important consequence of Bose-Einstein statistics is that a gas of molecules below a certain\ntemperature will undergo a phase transition to a state where a large fraction of atoms populate the\nsame lowest energy state. Some seventy years were to pass before the pioneering ideas of Bose, developed\nfurther by Einstein, were dramatically confirmed in the observation of a new state of matter in a dilute\ngas of ultra cold alkali atoms - the Bose-Eintein  condensate.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS10\n\ntheories and domains. Newton unified terrestrial\nand celestial domains under a common law of\ngravitation.  The experimental discoveries of\nOersted and Faraday showed that electric and\nmagnetic phenomena are in general\ninseparable.  Maxwell unified electromagnetism\nand optics with the discovery that light is an\nelectromagnetic wave.  Einstein attempted to\nunify gravity and electromagnetism but could\nnot succeed in this venture. But this did not\ndeter physicists from zealously pursuing the\ngoal of unification of forces.\n\nRecent decades have seen much progress on\nthis front.  The electromagnetic and the weak\nnuclear force have now been unified and are\nseen as aspects of a single ‘electro-weak’ force.\nWhat this unification actually means cannot\nbe explained here. Attempts have been (and are\nbeing) made to unify the electro-weak and the\nstrong force and even to unify the gravitational\nforce with the rest of the fundamental forces.\nMany of these ideas are still speculative and\ninconclusive. Table 1.4 summarises some of the\nmilestones in the progress towards unification\nof forces in nature.\n\n1.5   NATURE OF PHYSICAL LAWS\n\nPhysicists explore the universe. Their\ninvestigations, based on scientific processes,\nrange from particles that are smaller than\natoms in size to stars that are very far away. In\naddition to finding the facts by observation and\nexperimentation, physicists attempt to discover\nthe laws that summarise (often as mathematical\nequations) these facts.\n\nIn any physical phenomenon governed by\ndifferent forces, several quantities may change\nwith time. A remarkable fact is that some special\nphysical quantities, however, remain constant\nin time. They are the conserved quantities of\nnature. Understanding these conservation\nprinciples is very important to describe the\nobserved phenomena quantitatively.\n\nFor motion under an external conservative\nforce, the total mechanical energy i.e. the sum\nof kinetic and potential energy of a body is a\nconstant. The familiar example is the free fall of\nan object under gravity. Both the kinetic energy\nof the object and its potential energy change\ncontinuously with time, but the sum remains\nfixed. If the object is released from rest, the initial\n\nTable 1.4  Progress in unification of different forces/domains in nature\n\nTable 1.3  Fundamental  forces  of  nature\n\nName Relative Range Operates among\nstrength\n\nGravitational force 10–39 Infinite All objects in the universe\n\nWeak nuclear force 10–13 Very short, Sub-nuclear Some elementary particles,\nsize (∼10–16m) particularly electron and\n\nneutrino\n\nElectromagnetic force 10–2 Infinite Charged particles\n\nStrong nuclear force 1 Short, nuclear Nucleons, heavier\nsize (∼10–15m) elementary particles\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICAL WORLD 11\n\npotential energy is completely converted into the\nkinetic energy of the object just before it hits\nthe ground. This law restricted for a conservative\nforce should not be confused with the general\nlaw of conservation of energy of an isolated\nsystem (which is the basis of the First Law of\nThermodynamics).\n\nThe concept of energy is central to physics\nand the expressions for energy can be written\nfor every physical system. When all forms of\nenergy e.g., heat, mechanical energy, electrical\nenergy etc., are counted, it turns out that energy\nis conserved. The general law of conservation of\nenergy is true for all forces and for any kind of\ntransformation between different forms of\nenergy. In the falling object example, if you\ninclude the effect of air resistance during the\nfall and see the situation after the object hits\nthe ground and stays there, the total\nmechanical energy is obviously not conserved.\nThe general law of energy conservation, however,\nis still applicable.  The initial potential energy\nof the stone gets transformed into other forms\nof energy : heat and sound. (Ultimately, sound\nafter it is absorbed becomes heat.) The total\nenergy of the system (stone plus the\nsurroundings) remains unchanged.\n\nThe law of conservation of energy is thought\nto be valid across all domains of nature, from\nthe microscopic to the macroscopic. It is\nroutinely applied in the analysis of atomic,\nnuclear and elementary particle processes.  At\n\nthe other end, all kinds of violent phenomena\noccur in the universe all the time.  Yet the total\nenergy of the universe (the most ideal isolated\nsystem possible !) is believed to remain\nunchanged.\n\nUntil the advent of Einstein’s theory of\nrelativity, the law of conservation of mass was\nregarded as another basic conservation law of\nnature, since matter was thought to be\nindestructible. It was (and still is) an important\nprinciple used, for example, in the analysis of\nchemical reactions. A chemical reaction is\nbasically a rearrangement of atoms among\ndifferent molecules.  If the total binding energy\nof the reacting molecules is less than the total\nbinding energy of the product molecules, the\ndifference appears as heat and the reaction is\nexothermic.  The opposite is true for energy\nabsorbing (endothermic) reactions.  However,\nsince the atoms are merely rearranged but not\ndestroyed, the total mass of the reactants is the\nsame as the total mass of the products in a\nchemical reaction. The changes in the binding\nenergy are too small to be measured as changes\nin mass.\n\nAccording to Einstein’s theory, mass m is\nequivalent to energy E given by the relation\nE = mc\n\n2\n, where c is speed of light in vacuum.\n\nIn a nuclear process mass gets converted to\nenergy (or vice-versa). This is the energy which\nis released in a nuclear power generation and\n\nnuclear explosions.\n\nSir C.V. Raman (1888-1970)\n\nChandrashekhara Venkata Raman  was born on 07 Nov 1888 in Thiruvanaikkaval.\nHe finished his schooling by the age of eleven. He graduated from Presidency\nCollege, Madras. After finishing his education he joined financial services of the\nIndian Government.\n\nWhile in Kolkata, he started working on his area of interest at Indian Asso-\nciation for Cultivation of Science founded  by Dr. Mahendra Lal Sirkar, during his\nevening hours. His area of interest included vibrations, variety of musical instru-\nments, ultrasonics, diffraction and so on.\n\nIn 1917 he was offered Professorship at Calcutta University. In 1924 he was\nelected ‘Fellow’ of the Royal Society of London and received Nobel prize in Physics\nin 1930 for his discovery, now known as Raman Effect.\n\nThe Raman Effect deals with scattering of light by molecules of a medium\nwhen they are excited to vibrational energy levels. This work opened totally new\navenues for research for years to come.\n\nHe spent his later years at Bangalore, first at Indian Institute of Science and then at Raman Re-\nsearch Institute. His work has inspired generation of young students.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS12\n\nEnergy is a scalar quantity.  But all conserved\n\nquantities are not necessarily scalars.  The total\n\nlinear momentum and the total angular\n\nmomentum (both vectors) of an isolated system\n\nare also conserved quantities.  These laws can\n\nbe derived from Newton’s laws of motion in\n\nmechanics.  But their validity goes beyond\n\nmechanics.  They are the basic conservation\n\nlaws of nature in all domains, even in those\n\nwhere Newton’s laws may not be valid.\n\nBesides their great simplicity and generality,\n\nthe conservation laws of nature are very useful\n\nin practice too.  It often happens that we cannot\n\nsolve the full dynamics of a complex problem\n\ninvolving different particles and forces. The\n\nconservation laws can still provide useful\n\nresults.  For example, we may not know the\n\ncomplicated forces that act during a collision\n\nof two automobiles; yet momentum\n\nconservation law enables us to bypass the\n\ncomplications and predict or rule out possible\n\noutcomes of the collision. In nuclear and\n\nelementary particle phenomena also, the\n\nconservation laws are important tools of\n\nanalysis.  Indeed, using the conservation laws\n\nof energy and momentum for β-decay, Wolfgang\n\nPauli (1900-1958) correctly predicted in 1931\n\nthe existence of a new particle (now called\n\nneutrino) emitted in β-decay along with the\n\nelectron.\n\nConservation laws have a deep connection\n\nwith symmetries of nature that you will explore\n\nin more advanced courses in physics.  For\n\nexample, an important observation is that the\n\nlaws of nature do not change with time!  If you\n\nperform an experiment in your laboratory today\n\nand repeat the same experiment (on the same\n\nobjects under identical conditions) after a year,\n\nthe results are bound to be the same.  It turns\n\nout that this symmetry of nature with respect to\n\ntranslation (i.e. displacement) in time is\n\nequivalent to the law of conservation of energy.\n\nLikewise, space is homogeneous and there is no\n\n(intrinsically) preferred location in the universe.\n\nTo put it more clearly, the laws of nature are the\n\nsame everywhere in the universe. (Caution : the\n\nphenomena may differ from place to place\n\nbecause of differing conditions at different\n\nlocations. For example, the acceleration due to\n\ngravity at the moon is one-sixth that at the earth,\n\nbut the law of gravitation is the same both on\nthe moon and the earth.)  This symmetry of the\n\nlaws of nature with respect to translation in\n\nspace gives rise to conservation of linear\n\nmomentum.  In the same way isotropy of space\n\n(no intrinsically preferred direction in space)\n\nunderlies the law of conservation of angular\n\nmomentum*. The conservation laws of charge and\nother attributes of elementary particles can also\n\nbe related to certain abstract symmetries.\n\nSymmetries of space and time and other abstract\n\nsymmetries play a central role in modern theories\n\nof fundamental forces in nature.\n\n* See Chapter 7\n\nConservation laws in physics\n\nConservation of energy, momentum, angular\nmomentum, charge, etc are considered to be\nfundamental laws in physics. At this moment,\nthere are many such conservation laws. Apart from\nthe above four, there are others which mostly deal\nwith quantities which have been introduced in\nnuclear and particle physics. Some of the\nconserved quantities are called spin, baryon\nnumber, strangeness, hypercharge, etc, but you\nneed not worry about them.\n\nA conservation law is a hypothesis, based on\nobservations and experiments. It is important to\nremember that a conservation law cannot be\nproved. It can be verified, or disproved, by\nexperiments. An experiment whose result is  in\nconformity with the law verifies or substantiates\nthe law; it does not prove the law. On the other\nhand, a single experiment whose result goes\nagainst the law is enough to disprove it.\n\nIt would be wrong to ask somebody to prove\nthe law of conservation of energy. This law is an\noutcome of our experience over several centuries,\nand it has been found to be valid in all\nexperiments, in mechanics, thermodynamics,\nelectromagnetism, optics, atomic and nuclear\nphysics, or any other area.\n\nSome students feel that they can prove the\nconservation of mechanical energy from a body\nfalling under gravity, by adding the kinetic and\npotential energies at a point and showing that it\nturns out to be constant. As pointed out above,\nthis is only a verification of the law, not its proof.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICAL WORLD 13\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. Physics deals with the study of the basic laws of nature and their manifestation in\ndifferent phenomena. The basic laws of physics are universal and apply in widely different\ncontexts and conditions.\n\n2. The scope of physics is wide, covering a tremendous range of magnitude of physical\nquantities.\n\n3. Physics and technology are related to each other.  Sometimes technology gives rise to\nnew physics; at other times physics generates new technology.  Both have direct impact\non society.\n\n4. There are four fundamental forces in nature that govern the diverse phenomena of the\nmacroscopic and the microscopic world. These are the ‘gravitational force’, the\n‘electromagnetic force’, the ‘strong nuclear force’, and the ‘weak nuclear force’.  Unification\nof different forces/domains in nature is a basic quest in physics.\n\n5. The physical quantities that remain unchanged in a process are called conserved\nquantities. Some of the general conservation laws in nature include the laws of\nconservation of mass, energy, linear momentum, angular momentum, charge, parity,\netc.  Some conservation laws are true for one fundamental force but not for the other.\n\n6. Conservation laws have a deep connection with symmetries of nature.  Symmetries of\nspace and time, and other types of symmetries play a central role in modern theories of\nfundamental forces in nature.\n\nEXERCISES\n\nNote for the student\n\nThe exercises given here are meant to enhance your awareness about the issues surrounding\nscience, technology and society and to encourage you to think and formulate your views\nabout them.  The questions may not have clear-cut ‘objective’ answers.\n\nNote for the teacher\n\nThe exercises given here are not  for the purpose of a formal examination.\n\n1.1 Some of the most profound statements on the nature of science have come from\nAlbert Einstein, one of the greatest scientists of all time.  What do you think did\nEinstein mean when he said :  “The most incomprehensible thing about the world is\nthat it is comprehensible”?\n\n1.2 “Every great physical theory starts as a heresy and ends as a dogma”. Give some\nexamples from the history of science of the validity of this incisive remark.\n\n1.3 “Politics is the art of the possible”. Similarly, “Science is the art of the soluble”.\nExplain this beautiful aphorism on the nature and practice of science.\n\n1.4 Though India now has a large base in science and technology, which is fast expanding,\nit is still a long way from realising its potential of becoming a world leader in science.\nName some important factors, which in your view have hindered the advancement of\nscience in India.\n\n1.5 No physicist has ever “seen” an electron.  Yet, all physicists believe in the existence of\nelectrons.  An intelligent but superstitious man advances this analogy to argue that\n‘ghosts’ exist even though no one has ‘seen’ one.  How will you refute his argument ?\n\n1.6 The shells of crabs found around a particular coastal location in Japan seem mostly\nto resemble the legendary face of a Samurai.  Given below are two explanations of this\nobserved fact.  Which of these strikes you as a scientific explanation ?\n\n(a) A tragic sea accident several centuries ago drowned a young Samurai. As a tribute\nto his bravery, nature through its inscrutable ways immortalised his face by\nimprinting it on the crab shells in that area.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS14\n\n(b) After the sea tragedy, fishermen in that  area, in a gesture of honour to their\ndead hero, let free any crab shell caught by them which accidentally had a shape\nresembling the face of a Samurai.  Consequently, the particular shape  of the\ncrab shell survived longer and therefore in course of time the shape was genetically\npropagated.  This is an example of evolution by artificial selection.\n\n[Note : This interesting illustration taken from Carl Sagan’s ‘The Cosmos’ highlights\nthe fact that often strange and inexplicable facts which on the first sight appear\n‘supernatural’ actually turn out to have simple scientific explanations. Try to think\nout other examples of this kind].\n\n1.7 The industrial revolution in England and Western Europe more than two centuries\nago was triggered by some key scientific and technological advances.  What were these\nadvances ?\n\n1.8 It is often said that the world is witnessing now a second industrial revolution, which\nwill transform the society as radically as did the first. List some key contemporary areas\nof science and technology, which are responsible for this revolution.\n\n1.9 Write in about 1000 words a fiction piece based on your speculation on the science\nand technology of the twenty-second century.\n\n1.10 Attempt to formulate your ‘moral’ views on the practice of science.  Imagine yourself\nstumbling upon a discovery, which has great academic interest but is certain to have\nnothing but dangerous consequences for the human society.  How, if at all, will you\nresolve your dilemma ?\n\n1.11 Science, like any knowledge, can be put to good or bad use, depending on the user.\nGiven below are some of the applications of science.  Formulate your views on whether\nthe particular application is good, bad or something that cannot be so clearly\ncategorised :\n(a) Mass vaccination against small pox to curb and finally eradicate this disease\n\nfrom the population. (This has already been successfully done in India).\n(b) Television for eradication of illiteracy and for mass communication of news and\n\nideas.\n(c) Prenatal sex determination\n(d) Computers for increase in work efficiency\n(e) Putting artificial satellites into orbits  around the Earth\n(f ) Development of nuclear weapons\n(g) Development of new and powerful techniques of chemical and biological warfare).\n(h) Purification of water for drinking\n(i) Plastic surgery\n(j ) Cloning\n\n1.12 India has had a long and unbroken tradition of great scholarship — in mathematics,\nastronomy, linguistics, logic and ethics.  Yet, in parallel with this, several superstitious\nand obscurantistic  attitudes and practices flourished in our society and unfortunately\ncontinue even today — among many educated people too. How will you use your\nknowledge of science to develop strategies to counter these attitudes ?\n\n1.13 Though the law gives women equal status in India, many people hold unscientific\nviews on a woman’s innate nature, capacity and intelligence, and in practice give\nthem a secondary status and role. Demolish this view using scientific arguments, and\nby quoting examples of great women in science and other spheres; and persuade yourself\nand others that, given equal opportunity, women are on par with men.\n\n1.14 “It is more important to have beauty in the equations of physics than to have them\nagree with experiments”. The great British physicist P. A. M. Dirac held this view.\nCriticize this statement.  Look out for some equations and results in this book which\nstrike you as beautiful.\n\n1.15 Though the statement quoted above may be disputed, most physicists do have a feeling\nthat the great laws of physics are at once simple and beautiful. Some of the notable\nphysicists, besides Dirac, who have articulated this feeling, are : Einstein, Bohr,\nHeisenberg, Chandrasekhar and Feynman. You are urged to make special efforts to get\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICAL WORLD 15\n\naccess to the general books and writings by these and other great masters of physics.\n(See the Bibliography at the end of this book.) Their writings are truly inspiring !\n\n1.16 Textbooks on science may give you a wrong impression that studying science is dry\nand all too serious and that scientists are absent-minded introverts who never laugh\nor grin.  This image of science and scientists is patently false. Scientists, like any\nother group of humans, have their share of humorists, and many have led their lives\nwith a great sense of fun and adventure, even as they seriously pursued their scientific\nwork. Two great physicists of this genre are Gamow and Feynman. You will enjoy\nreading their books listed in the Bibliography.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n\n')('status', 200)
