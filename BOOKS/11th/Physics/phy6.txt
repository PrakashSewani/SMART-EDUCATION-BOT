A farmer ploughing the field, a\nconstruction worker carrying bricks, a student studying for\na competitive examination, an artist painting a beautiful\nlandscape, all are said to be working. In physics, however,\nthe word ‘Work’ covers a definite and precise meaning.\nSomebody who has the capacity to work for 14-16 hours a\nday is said to have a large stamina or energy. We admire a\nlong distance runner for her stamina or energy. Energy is\nthus our capacity to do work. In Physics too, the term ‘energy’\nis related to work in this sense, but as said above the term\n‘work’ itself is defined much more precisely. The word ‘power’\nis used in everyday life with different shades of meaning. In\nkarate or boxing we talk of ‘powerful’ punches. These are\ndelivered at a great speed. This shade of meaning is close to\nthe meaning of the word ‘power’ used in physics. We shall\nfind that there is at best a loose correlation between the\nphysical definitions and the physiological pictures these\nterms generate in our minds. The aim of this chapter is to\ndevelop an understanding of these three physical quantities.\nBefore we proceed to this task, we need to develop a\nmathematical prerequisite, namely the scalar product of two\nvectors.\n\n6.1.1 The Scalar Product\n\nWe have learnt about vectors and their use in Chapter 4.\nPhysical quantities like displacement, velocity, acceleration,\nforce etc. are vectors. We have also learnt how vectors are\nadded or subtracted. We now need to know how vectors are\nmultiplied. There are two ways of multiplying vectors which\nwe shall come across : one way known as the scalar product\ngives a scalar from two vectors and the other known as the\nvector product produces a new vector from two vectors. We\nshall look at the vector product in Chapter 7. Here we take\nup the scalar product of two vectors. The scalar product or\ndot product of any two vectors A and B, denoted as A.B (read\n\n6.1 Introduction\n\n6.2 Notions of work and kinetic\nenergy : The work-energy\ntheorem\n\n6.3 Work\n\n6.4 Kinetic energy\n\n6.5 Work done by a variable\nforce\n\n6.6 The work-energy theorem for\na variable force\n\n6.7 The concept of potential\nenergy\n\n6.8 The conservation of\nmechanical energy\n\n6.9 The potential energy of a\nspring\n\n6.10 Various forms of energy : the\nlaw of conservation of energy\n\n6.11 Power\n\n6.12 Collisions\n\nSummary\n\nPoints to ponder\n\nExercises\n\nAdditional exercises\n\nAppendix 6.1\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nA dot B) is defined as\n\nA.B = A B cos θ (6.1a)\n\nwhere θ  is the angle between the two vectors as\nshown in Fig. 6.1(a). Since A, B and cos θ are\nscalars, the dot product of A and B is a scalar\nquantity. Each vector, A and B, has a direction\nbut their scalar product does not have a\ndirection.\n\nFrom Eq. (6.1a), we have\n\nA.B  = A (B cos θ )\n\n       = B (A cos θ )\n\nGeometrically, B cos θ is the projection of B onto\nA in Fig.6.1 (b) and A cos θ  is the projection of A\nonto B in Fig. 6.1 (c). So, A.B is the product of\nthe magnitude of A and the component of B along\nA. Alternatively, it is the product of the\nmagnitude of B and the component of A along B.\n\nEquation (6.1a) shows that the scalar product\nfollows the commutative law :\n\nA.B = B.A\n\nScalar product obeys the distributive\nlaw:\n\nA. (B + C) = A.B + A.C\n\nFurther, A. (λ B) = λ (A.B)\n\nwhere λ is a real number.\n\nThe proofs  of the above equations are left to\nyou as an exercise.\n\nFor unit vectors \uf001 \uf001 \uf001i, j,k  we have\n\uf001 \uf001 \uf001 \uf001 \uf001 \uf001i i j j k k⋅ = ⋅ = ⋅ = 1\n\uf001 \uf001 \uf001 \uf001 \uf001 \uf001i j j k k i⋅ = ⋅ = ⋅ = 0\n\nGiven two vectors\n\nA i j k= + +A A A\nx y z\n\uf001 \uf001 \uf001\n\nB i j k= + +B B B\nx y z\n\uf001 \uf001 \uf001\n\ntheir scalar product is\n\n( ) ( )ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ. .x y z x y zA A A B B B= + + + +A B i j k i j k\n = + +A B A B A Bx x y y z z (6.1b)\n\nFrom the definition of scalar product and\n(Eq. 6.1b) we have :\n\n( i ) x x y y z zA A A A A A= + +A A....\n\nOr, A A A A\n2\n\nx\n\n2\n\ny\n\n2\n\nz\n\n2\n= + + (6.1c)\n\nsince A.A = |A ||A| cos 0 = A2.\n(ii) A.B = 0, if A and B are perpendicular.\n\nExample 6.1  Find the angle between force\n\nF = (3 +4 -5 )ˆ ˆ ˆi j k unit and displacement\n\nd = (5 + 4 +3 )ˆ ˆ ˆi j k unit.

Consider a\nconstant force F acting on an object of mass m.\nThe object undergoes a displacement d in the\npositive x-direction as shown in Fig. 6.2.\n\nFig. 6.2 An object undergoes a displacement d\n\nunder the influence of the force F.\n\n6.2 NOTIONS OF WORK AND KINETIC\nENERGY: THE WORK-ENERGY THEOREM\n\nThe following relation for rectilinear motion under\nconstant acceleration a has been encountered\nin Chapter 3,\n\n      v2 − u2 = 2 as (6.2)\n\nwhere u and v  are the initial and final speeds\nand s the distance traversed.  Multiplying both\nsides by m/2, we have\n\n2 21 1\n\n2 2\nmv mu mas Fs− = = (6.2a)\n\nwhere the last step follows from Newton’s Second\nLaw. We can generalise Eq. (6.2) to three\ndimensions by employing vectors\n\nv2 − u2 = 2 a.d\n\nHere a and d are acceleration and displacement\nvectors of the object respectively.\nOnce again multiplying both sides by m/2 , we obtain\n\n2 21 1\n\n2 2\nmv mu m − = =a.d F.d (6.2b)\n\nThe above equation provides a motivation for\nthe definitions of work and kinetic energy. The\nleft side of the equation is the difference in the\nquantity ‘half the mass times the square of the\nspeed’ from its initial value to its final value. We\ncall each of these quantities the ‘kinetic energy’,\ndenoted by K. The right side is a product of the\ndisplacement and the component of the force\nalong the displacement.  This quantity is called\n‘work’ and is denoted by W.  Eq. (6.2b) is then\n\nK\nf \n−  K\n\ni \n= W (6.3)\n\nwhere K\ni\n  and K\n\nf\n  are respectively the initial and\n\nfinal kinetic energies of the object. Work refers\nto the force and the displacement over which it\nacts. Work is done by a force on the body over\na certain displacement.\n\nEquation (6.2) is also a special case of the\nwork-energy (WE) theorem : The change in\nkinetic energy of a particle is equal to the\nwork done on it by the net force. We shall\ngeneralise the above derivation to a varying force\nin a later section.\n\nExample 6.2  It is well known that a\nraindrop falls under the influence of the\ndownward gravitational force and the\nopposing resistive force.  The latter is known\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nWORK, ENERGY AND POWER 117\n\n\uf074\n\nTable 6.1   Alternative Units of Work/Energy in J\n\nExample 6.3  A cyclist comes to a skidding\nstop in 10 m.  During this process, the force\non the cycle due to the road is 200 N and\nis directly opposed to the motion.  (a) How\nmuch work does the road do on the cycle ?\n(b) How much work does the cycle do on\nthe road ?\n\nAnswer  Work done on the cycle by the road is\n\nthe work done by the stopping (frictional) force\n\non the cycle due to the road.\n\n(a) The stopping force and the displacement make\n\nan angle of 180o  (π rad) with each other.\nThus, work done by the road,\n\nW\nr\n =  Fd cosθ\n\n     =  200 × 10 × cos π\n\n      = – 2000 J\nIt is this negative work that brings the cycle\n\nto a halt in accordance with WE theorem.\n\n(b) From Newton’s Third Law an equal and\n\nopposite force acts on the road due to the\n\ncycle. Its magnitude is 200 N. However, the\n\nroad undergoes no displacement.  Thus,\n\nwork done by cycle on the road is zero.            \uf074\n\nThe lesson of Example 6.3 is that though the\n\nforce on a body A exerted by the body B is always\n\nequal and opposite to that on B by A (Newton’s\n\nThird Law); the work done on A by B is not\n\nnecessarily equal and opposite to the work done\n\non B by A.\n\n6.4  KINETIC ENERGY\n\nAs noted earlier, if an object of mass m has\n\nvelocity v, its kinetic energy K  is\n\n2\nK m mv\n\n1 1\n= =\n\n2 2\nv v.                        (6.5)\n\nKinetic energy is a scalar quantity. The kinetic\n\nenergy of an object is a measure of the work an\n\nThe work done by the force is defined to be\n\nthe product of component of the force in the\n\ndirection of the displacement and the\n\nmagnitude of this displacement.  Thus\n\nW = (F cos θ )d = F.d (6.4)\n\nWe see that if there is no displacement, there\n\nis no work done even if the force is large.  Thus,\n\nwhen you push hard against a rigid brick wall,\n\nthe force you exert on the wall does no work.  Yet\n\nyour muscles are alternatively contracting and\n\nrelaxing and internal energy is being used up\n\nand you do get tired.  Thus, the meaning of work\n\nin physics is different from its usage in everyday\n\nlanguage.\n\nNo work is done if :\n\n(i) the displacement is zero as seen in the\n\nexample above. A weightlifter holding a 150\n\nkg mass steadily on his shoulder for 30 s\n\ndoes no work on the load during this time.\n\n(ii) the force is zero.  A block moving on a smooth\n\nhorizontal table is not acted upon by a\n\nhorizontal force (since there is no friction), but\n\nmay undergo a large displacement.\n\n(iii) the force and displacement are mutually\n\nperpendicular. This is so since, for θ = π/2 rad\n(= 90o), cos (π/2) = 0.  For the block moving on\na smooth horizontal table, the gravitational\n\nforce mg  does no work since it acts at right\n\nangles to the displacement. If we assume that\n\nthe moon’s orbits around the earth is\n\nperfectly circular then the earth’s\n\ngravitational force does no work.  The moon’s\n\ninstantaneous displacement is tangential\n\nwhile the earth’s force is radially inwards and\n\nθ  = π/2.\nWork can be both positive and negative.  If θ  is\n\nbetween 0o and 90o, cos θ  in Eq. (6.4) is positive.\nIf  θ  is  between 90o and 180o,   cos θ  is negative.\nIn many examples the frictional force opposes\n\ndisplacement and θ  = 180o. Then the work done\nby friction is negative (cos 180o = –1).\n\nFrom Eq. (6.4) it is clear that  work and energy\n\nhave the same dimensions,  [ML2T–2]. The SI unit\n\nof these is joule (J), named after the famous British\n\nphysicist James Prescott Joule  (1811-1869). Since\n\nwork and energy are so widely used as physical\n\nconcepts, alternative units abound and some of\n\nthese are listed in Table 6.1.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS118\n\n\uf074\n\nobject can do by the virtue of its motion.

Table\n\n6.2 lists the kinetic energies for various\n\nobjects.\n\nExample 6.4  In a ballistics demonstration\na police officer fires a bullet of mass 50.0 g\nwith speed 200 m s-1 (see Table 6.2) on soft\nplywood of thickness 2.00 cm.  The bullet\nemerges with only 10% of its initial kinetic\nenergy.  What is the emergent speed of the\nbullet ?\n\nAnswer  The initial kinetic energy of the bullet\nis mv2/2 = 1000 J.  It has a final kinetic energy\nof 0.1×1000 = 100 J.

It is the variable force,\nwhich is more commonly encountered.  Fig. 6.3\nis a plot of a varying force in one dimension.\n\nIf the displacement ∆x is small, we can take\nthe force F (x)  as approximately constant and\nthe work done is then\n\n∆W =F (x) ∆x\n\nTable 6.2  Typical kinetic energies (K)\n\nThis is illustrated in Fig. 6.3(a).  Adding\nsuccessive rectangular areas in Fig. 6.3(a) we\nget the total work done as\n\n( )\uf001 ∆≅\nf\n\ni\n\nx\n\nx\n\nxxFW (6.6)\n\nwhere the summation is from the initial position\nx\n\ni\n \n \nto the final position x\n\nf\n.\n\nIf the displacements are allowed to approach\nzero, then the number of terms in the sum\nincreases without limit, but the sum approaches\na definite value equal to the area under the curve\nin Fig. 6.3(b). Then the work done is\n\n          = ( )∫ F x x\nx\n\nx\n\ni\n\nf\n\nd (6.7)\n\nwhere ‘lim’ stands for the limit of the sum when\n∆x  tends to zero.  Thus, for a varying force\nthe work done can be expressed as a definite\nintegral of force over displacement (see also\nAppendix 3.1).\n\nlimW =\nlim\n\nx∆ →\n( )\uf001 ∆\n\nf\n\ni\n\nx\n\nx\n\nxxF\n0\n\nFig. 6.3(a)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nWORK, ENERGY AND POWER 119\n\n\uf074\n\nFig. 6.3 (a) The shaded rectangle represents the\nwork done by the varying force F(x), over\nthe small displacement ∆x,  ∆W = F(x) ∆x.\n(b) adding the areas of all the rectangles we\n\nfind that for ∆x → 0, the area under the curve\nis exactly equal to the work done by F(x).\n\nExample 6.5  A woman pushes a trunk on\na railway platform which has a rough\nsurface.  She applies a force of 100 N over a\ndistance of 10 m.  Thereafter, she gets\nprogressively tired and her applied force\nreduces linearly with distance to 50 N.  The\ntotal distance through which the trunk has\nbeen moved is 20 m.  Plot the force applied\nby the woman and the frictional force, which\nis 50 N versus displacement.  Calculate the\nwork done by the two forces over 20 m.\n\nAnswer\n\nFig. 6.4 Plot of the force F applied by the woman and\nthe opposing frictional force f versus\n\ndisplacement.\n\nThe plot of the applied force is shown in Fig.\n6.4.  At x  = 20 m, F  = 50 N (≠ 0).  We are given\nthat the frictional force f is |f|= 50 N. It opposes\nmotion and acts in a direction opposite to F.  It\nis therefore, shown on the negative side of the\nforce axis.\n\nThe work done by the woman is\n\nW\nF \n\n→ area of the rectangle ABCD + area of\nthe trapezium CEID\n\n( )WF = × + + ×100 10\n1\n\n2\n100 50 10\n\n       = 1000 + 750\n      = 1750 J\n\nThe work done by the frictional force is\n\nW\nf \n→ area of the rectangle AGHI\nW\n\nf\n  = (−50) × 20\n\n      = − 1000 J\nThe area on the negative side of the force axis\nhas a negative sign. \uf074\n\n6.6 THE WORK-ENERGY THEOREM FOR A\nVARIABLE FORCE\n\nWe are now familiar with the concepts of work\nand kinetic energy to prove the work-energy\ntheorem for a variable force.  We confine\nourselves to one dimension. The time rate of\nchange of kinetic energy is\n\nd\n\nd\n\nd\n\nd\n\nK\n\nt t\nm v=\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n1\n\n2\n2\n\n      \nd\n\nd\n\nv\nm v\n\nt\n=\n\n      v F=  (from Newton’s Second Law)\n\n      \nd\n\nd\n\nx\nF\n\nt\n=\n\nThus\n             dK = Fdx\nIntegrating from the initial position  (x \n\ni\n ) to final\n\nposition ( x \nf\n ), we have\n\nd dK F x\nK\n\nK\n\nx\n\nx\n\ni\n\nf\n\ni\n\nf\n\n∫ ∫=\n\nwhere,  K\ni\n  and K \n\nf\n  are the initial and final kinetic\n\nenergies corresponding to x\n i \n and\n\n \n x \n\nf\n.\n\nor K K F xf i\nx\n\nx\n\ni\n\nf\n\n− = ∫ d  (6.8a)\n\nFrom Eq. (6.7), it follows that\n\n           K\nf\n −  K\n\ni  \n= W (6.8b)\n\nThus, the WE theorem is proved for a variable\n\nforce.\n\nWhile the WE theorem is useful in a variety of\n\nproblems, it does not, in general, incorporate the\n\ncomplete dynamical information of Newton’s\n\nsecond law. It is an integral form of Newton’s\n\nsecond law. Newton’s second law is a relation\n\nbetween acceleration and force at any instant of\n\ntime. Work-energy theorem involves an integral\n\nover an interval of time. In this sense, the temporal\n\n(time) information contained in the statement of\n\nNewton’s second law is ‘integrated over’ and is\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS120\n\n\uf074\n\nnot available explicitly. Another observation is that\nNewton’s second law for two or three dimensions\nis in vector form whereas the work-energy\ntheorem is in scalar form. In the scalar form,\ninformation with respect to directions contained\nin Newton’s second law is not present.\n\nExample 6.6  A block of mass m  = 1 kg,\nmoving on a horizontal surface with speed\nv\n\ni\n = 2 m s–1 enters a rough patch ranging\n\nfrom x = 0.10 m to x = 2.01 m.

The term potential energy\nbrings to one’s mind ‘stored’ energy. A stretched\nbow-string possesses potential energy. When it\nis released, the arrow flies off at a great speed.\nThe earth’s crust is not uniform, but has\ndiscontinuities and dislocations that are called\nfault lines. These fault lines in the earth’s crust\n\nare like ‘compressed springs’. They possess a\nlarge amount of potential energy. An earthquake\nresults when these fault lines readjust. Thus,\npotential energy is the ‘stored energy’ by virtue\nof the position or configuration of a body. The\nbody left to itself releases this stored energy in\nthe form of kinetic energy. Let us make our notion\nof potential energy more concrete.\n\nThe gravitational force on a ball of mass m is\nmg . g may be treated as a constant near the earth\nsurface. By ‘near’ we imply that the height h  of\nthe ball above the earth’s surface is very small\ncompared to the earth’s radius R\n\nE \n(h <<R\n\nE\n) so that\n\nwe can ignore the variation of g near the earth’s\n\nsurface*. In what follows we have taken the\nupward direction to be positive. Let us raise the\nball up to a height h. The work done by the external\nagency against the gravitational force is mgh. This\nwork gets stored as potential energy.\nGravitational potential energy of an object, as a\nfunction of the height h, is denoted by V(h) and it\nis the negative of work done by the gravitational\nforce in raising the object to that height.\n\nV (h) = mgh\nIf h is taken as a variable, it is easily seen that\nthe gravitational force F equals the negative of\nthe derivative of V(h) with respect to h. Thus,\n\nd\n\nd\nF V(h) m g\n\nh\n= − = −\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the\ngravitational force is downward. When released,\nthe ball comes down with an increasing speed.\nJust before it hits the ground, its speed is given\nby the kinematic relation,\n\nv2 = 2gh\nThis equation can be written as\n\n2\n\n1\nm v2 = m g h\n\nwhich shows that the gravitational potential\nenergy of the object at height h, when the object\nis released, manifests itself as kinetic energy of\nthe object on reaching the ground.\n\nPhysically, the notion of potential energy is\napplicable only to the class of forces where work\ndone against the force gets ‘stored up’ as energy.\nWhen external constraints are removed, it\nmanifests itself as kinetic energy. Mathematically,\n(for simplicity, in one dimension) the potential\n\n* The variation of g with height is discussed in Chapter 8 on Gravitation.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nWORK, ENERGY AND POWER 121\n\nenergy V(x) is defined if the force F(x) can be\nwritten as\n\n( )\nd\n\nd\n\nV\nF x\n\nx\n= −\n\nThis implies that\n\nF(x) x V V V\nx\n\nx\n\ni f\n\nV\n\nV\n\ni\n\nf\n\ni\n\nf\n\nd d∫ ∫= − = −\n\nThe work done by a conservative force such as\n\ngravity depends on the initial and final positions\n\nonly. In the previous chapter we have worked\n\non examples dealing with inclined planes. If an\n\nobject of mass m is released from rest, from the\n\ntop of a smooth (frictionless) inclined plane of\n\nheight h, its speed at the bottom\n\nis gh2 irrespective of the angle of inclination.\n\nThus, at the bottom of the inclined plane it\n\nacquires a kinetic energy, mgh. If the work done\n\nor the kinetic energy did depend on other factors\n\nsuch as the velocity or the particular path taken\n\nby the object, the force would be called non-\n\nconservative.\nThe  dimensions  of  potential  energy are\n\n[ML2T –2] and the unit is joule (J), the same as\nkinetic energy or work. To reiterate, the change\nin potential energy, for a conservative force,\n∆V  is equal to the negative of the work done by\nthe force\n\n∆V = − F(x) ∆x (6.9)\nIn the example of the falling ball considered in\n\nthis section we saw how potential energy was\n\nconverted to kinetic energy. This hints at an\n\nimportant principle of conservation in mechanics,\n\nwhich we now proceed to examine.\n\n6.8 THE CONSERVATION OF MECHANICAL\nENERGY\n\nFor simplicity we demonstrate this important\n\nprinciple for one-dimensional motion. Suppose\n\nthat a body undergoes displacement ∆x under\nthe action of a conservative force F. Then from\n\nthe WE theorem we have,\n\n∆K =  F(x) ∆x\nIf the force is conservative, the potential energy\nfunction V(x) can be defined such that\n\n− ∆V  =  F(x) ∆x\nThe above equations imply that\n\n∆K + ∆V = 0\n∆(K + V ) = 0 (6.10)\n\nwhich means that K + V, the sum of the kinetic\n\nand potential energies of the body is a constant.\n\nOver the whole path, x\ni \nto x\n\nf\n, this means that\n\nK\ni\n + V(x\n\ni\n) = K\n\nf\n  + V(x\n\nf\n) (6.11)\n\nThe quantity K +V(x), is called the total\n\nmechanical energy of the system.  Individually\n\nthe kinetic energy K  and the potential energy\n\nV(x) may vary from point to point,  but the sum\n\nis a constant. The aptness of the term\n\n‘conservative force’ is now clear.\n\nLet us consider some of  the definitions of a\n\nconservative force.\n\n\uf06c A force F(x) is conservative if it can be derived\n\nfrom a scalar quantity V(x) by the relation\ngiven by Eq. (6.9). The three-dimensional\ngeneralisation requires the use of a vector\nderivative, which is outside the scope of this\nbook.\n\n\uf06c The work done by the conservative force\ndepends only on the end points. This can be\nseen from the relation,\n\nW = K\nf\n – K\n\ni\n = V (x\n\ni\n) – V(x\n\nf\n)\n\nwhich depends on the end points.\n\uf06c A third definition states that the work done\n\nby this force in a closed path is zero.  This is\nonce  again apparent from Eq. (6.11) since\nx\n\ni\n  = x\n\nf .\n\nThus, the principle of conservation of total\nmechanical energy can be stated as\n\nThe total mechanical energy of a system is\nconserved if the forces, doing work on it, are\nconservative.\n\nThe above discussion can be made more\nconcrete by considering the example of the\ngravitational force once again and that of the\nspring force in the next section. Fig. 6.5 depicts\na ball of mass m being dropped from a cliff of\nheight H.\n\nFig. 6.5 The conversion of potential energy to kinetic\nenergy for a ball of mass m dropped from a\n\nheight H.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS122\n\n\uf074\n\nThe total mechanical energies E\n0\n, E\n\nh\n, and E\n\nH\n\nof the ball at the indicated heights zero (ground\nlevel), h and H, are\n\nE\nH\n   = mgH                           (6.11 a)\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\nh hE mgh mv= + (6.11 b)\n\nE\n0     \n\n= (1/2) mv\nf\n2 (6.11 c)\n\nThe constant force is a special case of a spatially\ndependent force F(x). Hence, the mechanical\nenergy is conserved.  Thus\n\nE\nH\n = E\n\n0\n\nor,\n1\n\n2\n\n2\nfmgH mv=\n\n2fv gH=\n\na result that was obtained in section 3.7 for a\nfreely falling body.\nFurther,\n\nE\nH\n = E\n\nh\n\nwhich implies,\n\nv g(H h)h\n2\n\n2= −               (6.11 d)\n\nand is a familiar result from kinematics.\nAt the height H, the energy is purely potential.\n\nIt is partially converted to kinetic at height h  and\nis fully kinetic at ground level. This illustrates\nthe conservation of mechanical energy.\n\nExample 6.7  A bob of mass m is suspended\nby a light string of length L .  It is imparted a\nhorizontal velocity v\n\no\n at the lowest point A\n\nsuch that it completes a semi-circular\ntrajectory in the vertical plane with the string\nbecoming slack only on reaching the topmost\npoint, C.  This is shown in Fig. 6.6. Obtain an\nexpression for (i) v\n\no\n; (ii)  the speeds at points\n\nB and C; (iii) the ratio  of  the kinetic energies\n(K\n\nB\n/K\n\nC\n) at B and C. Comment on the nature\n\nof the trajectory of the bob after it reaches\nthe point C.\n\nFig. 6.6\n\nAnswer  (i)  There are two external forces on\nthe bob : gravity and the tension (T ) in the\n\nstring. The latter does no work since the\n\ndisplacement of the bob is always normal to the\n\nstring. The potential energy of the bob is thus\n\nassociated with the gravitational force only. The\n\ntotal mechanical energy E  of the system is\n\nconserved.  We take the potential energy of the\n\nsystem to be zero at the lowest point A. Thus,\n\nat A :\n\nE mv0\n2\n\n=\n1\n\n2\n(6.12)\n\n       [Newton’s Second Law]\n\nwhere T\nA\n is the tension  in the string at A.

Fig. 6.7 shows a block\nattached to a spring and resting on a smooth\nhorizontal surface.  The other end of the spring\nis attached to a rigid wall. The spring is light\nand may be treated as massless.  In an ideal\nspring, the spring force F\n\ns\n  is proportional to\n\nx where x  is the displacement of the block from\nthe equilibrium position. The displacement could\nbe either positive [Fig. 6.7(b)] or negative\n[Fig. 6.7(c)].  This force law for the spring is called\nHooke’s law and is mathematically stated as\n\nF\ns\n =  − kx\n\nThe constant k is called the spring constant.  Its\nunit is N m-1.  The spring is said to be stiff if k is\nlarge and soft if k is small.\n\nSuppose that we pull the block outwards as in\nFig. 6.7(b). If the extension is x\n\nm\n, the work done by\n\nthe spring force is\n\nW F  xs s\n0\n\nxm\n\n= ∫ d     = − ∫ kx x\n0\n\nxm\n\nd\n\n2\n\n2\nmx k−=          (6.15)\n\nThis expression may also be obtained by\nconsidering the area of the triangle as in\nFig. 6.7(d).  Note that the work done by the\nexternal pulling force F is positive since it\novercomes the spring force.\n\n2\n\n2\nmx kW += (6.16)\n\nFig. 6.7 Illustration of the spring force with a block\nattached to the free end of the spring.\n\n(a) The spring force F\ns\n is zero when the\n\ndisplacement x  from the equilibrium position\n\nis zero. (b) For the stretched spring x > 0\n\nand F\ns  \n\n< 0 (c) For the compressed spring\n\nx < 0 and  F\ns\n > 0.(d) The plot of F\n\ns\n  versus x.\n\nThe area of the shaded triangle represents\n\nthe work done by the spring force. Due to the\n\nopposing signs of F\ns\n and x, this work done is\n\nnegative, W kx /s m\n2\n\n= − 2 .\n\nThe same is true when the spring is\ncompressed with a displacement x\n\nc\n (< 0).  The\n\nspring force does work 2/ 2cs kxW −=  while the\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS124\n\nFig. 6.8 Parabolic plots of the potential energy V and\nkinetic energy K of a block attached to a\n\nspring obeying Hooke’s law. The two plots\n\nare complementary, one decreasing as the\n\nother increases. The total mechanical\n\nenergy E = K + V remains constant.\n\n\uf074\n\nexternal force F does work +  kxc\n2\n\n/ 2. If the block\n\nis moved from an initial displacement x\ni\n  to a\n\nfinal displacement x\nf\n , the work done by the\n\nspring force W\ns\n is\n\n  W k x x \nk x k x\n\ns\n\nx\n\nx\n\ni f\n\ni\n\nf\n\n= − = −∫ d     \n2 2\n\n2 2\n           \n\n(6.17)\n\nThus the work done by the spring force depends\nonly on the end points.  Specifically, if the block\nis pulled from x\n\ni\n  and allowed to return to x\n\ni\n ;\n\n      W k x x       \nk x k x\n\n s\ni i\n\nx\n\nx\n\ni\n\ni\n\n= − = −∫ d     \n2 2\n\n2 2\n\n       = 0 (6.18)\nThe work done by the spring force in a cyclic\nprocess is zero.  We have explicitly demonstrated\nthat the spring force (i) is position dependent\nonly as first stated by Hooke, (F\n\ns\n = − kx); (ii)\n\ndoes work which only depends on the initial and\nfinal positions, e.g. Eq. (6.17).  Thus, the spring\nforce is a conservative force.\n\nWe define the potential energy V(x) of the spring\nto be zero when block and spring system is in the\nequilibrium position.  For an extension (or\ncompression) x  the above analysis suggests that\n\nV(x)\nkx\n\n2\n\n=\n2\n\n(6.19)\n\nYou may easily verify that − dV/dx = − k x, the\nspring force.  If the block of mass m in Fig. 6.7 is\nextended to x\n\nm\n and released from rest, then its\n\ntotal mechanical energy at any arbitrary point x,\nwhere x lies between – x\n\nm \n and + x\n\nm,\n will be given by\n\n222\nm v mx kx k\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n+=\n\nwhere we have invoked the conservation of\nmechanical energy.  This suggests that the speed\nand the kinetic energy will be maximum at the\nequilibrium position, x = 0, i.e.,\n\n2\nm\n\n2\nm x k  v m\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n=\n\nwhere v\nm\n is the maximum speed.\n\nor mm x \nm\n\nk\nv =\n\nNote that k/m has the dimensions of [T-2] and\nour equation is dimensionally correct. The\nkinetic energy gets converted to potential energy\n\nand vice versa, however, the total mechanical\nenergy remains constant. This is graphically\ndepicted in Fig. 6.8.\n\nExample 6.8  To simulate car accidents, auto\nmanufacturers study the collisions of moving\ncars with mounted springs of different spring\nconstants.  Consider a typical simulation with\na car of mass 1000 kg moving with a speed\n18.0 km/h on a smooth road and colliding\nwith a horizontally mounted spring of spring\nconstant 6.25 × 103 N m–1. What is the\nmaximum compression of the spring ?\n\nAnswer   At maximum compression the kinetic\nenergy of the car is converted entirely into the\npotential energy of the spring.\n\nThe kinetic energy of the moving car is\n\nK mv\n2=\n\n1\n\n2\n\n    \n5510\n\n2\n\n1 3 ×××=\n\n            K  = 1.25 × 104 J\n\nwhere we have converted 18 km h–1 to 5 m s–1  [It is\nuseful to remember that 36 km h–1 = 10 m s–1].\nAt maximum compression x\n\nm\n, the potential\n\nenergy V of the spring is equal to the kinetic\nenergy K of the moving car from the principle of\nconservation of mechanical energy.\n\n2\nmx k  V\n\n2\n\n1\n=\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nWORK, ENERGY AND POWER 125\n\n\uf074\n\n                = 1.25 × 104 J\nWe obtain\n\nx\nm\n = 2.00 m\n\nWe note that we have idealised the situation.\nThe spring is considered to be massless. The\nsurface has been considered to possess\nnegligible friction. \uf074\n\nWe conclude this section by making a few\nremarks on conservative forces.\n\n(i) Information on time is absent from the above\n\ndiscussions. In the example considered\n\nabove, we can calculate the compression, but\n\nnot the time over which the compression\n\noccurs.  A solution of Newton’s Second Law\n\nfor this system is required for temporal\n\ninformation.\n\n(ii) Not all forces are conservative. Friction, for\n\nexample, is a non-conservative force. The\n\nprinciple of conservation of energy will have\n\nto be modified in this case. This is illustrated\n\nin Example 6.9.\n\n(iii) The zero of the potential energy is arbitrary.\n\nIt is set according to convenience.  For the\n\nspring force we took V(x) = 0, at x = 0, i.e. the\n\nunstretched spring had zero potential\n\nenergy.  For the constant gravitational force\n\nmg, we took V = 0  on the earth’s surface.  In\n\na later chapter we shall see that for the force\n\ndue to the universal law of gravitation, the\n\nzero is best defined at an infinite distance\n\nfrom the gravitational source. However, once\n\nthe zero of the potential energy is fixed in a\n\ngiven discussion, it must be consistently\n\nadhered to throughout the discussion. You\n\ncannot change horses in midstream !\n\nExample 6.9   Consider Example 6.8 taking\nthe coefficient of friction, µ, to be 0.5 and\ncalculate the  maximum compression of the\nspring.\n\nAnswer  In presence of friction, both the spring\n\nforce and the frictional force act so as to oppose\n\nthe compression of the spring as shown in\n\nFig. 6.9.\n\nWe invoke the work-energy theorem, rather\n\nthan the conservation of mechanical energy.\n\nThe change in kinetic energy is\n\nFig. 6.9  The forces acting on the car.\n\n∆K  = K\nf\n − K\n\ni \n\n2\nv m   \n\n2\n\n1\n0 −=\n\nThe work done by the net force is\n\n1\n\n2\n2\nm mW   kx   m g x= − − \uf001\n\nEquating we have\n\n1 1\n\n2 2\n2 2\n\nm mm v   k x  m g x= + \uf001\n\nNow  µmg  = 0.5 × 103 × 10 = 5 × 103 N (taking\ng =10.0 m s-2). After rearranging the above\nequation we obtain the following quadratic\nequation in the unknown x\n\nm\n.\n\n2\n2 2\nm mk x m g x m v 0+ − =\uf001\n\nwhere we take the positive square root since\nx\n\nm\n is positive. Putting in numerical values we\n\nobtain\n\nx\nm\n  = 1.35 m\n\nwhich, as expected, is less than the result in\nExample 6.8.\n\nIf the two forces on the body consist of a\nconservative force F\n\nc\n and a non-conservative\n\nforce  F\nnc\n , the conservation of mechanical energy\n\nformula will have to be modified. By the WE\ntheorem\n\n(F\nc\n+ F\n\nnc\n) ∆x = ∆K\n\nBut     F\nc\n ∆x = − ∆V\n\nHence,             ∆(K + V) = F\nnc \n\n∆x\n                       ∆E    = F\n\nnc \n∆x\n\nwhere E  is the total mechanical energy. Over\nthe path this assumes the form\n\nE\nf\n −−−−− E\n\ni\n  = W\n\nnc\n\nwhere W\nnc\n\n  is the total work done by the\nnon-conservative forces over the path. Note that\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS126\n\nunlike the conservative force, W\nnc  \n\ndepends on\nthe particular path i  to  f. \uf074\n\n6.10 VARIOUS FORMS OF ENERGY : THE LAW\nOF CONSERVATION OF ENERGY\n\nIn the previous section we have discussed\nmechanical energy.  We have seen that it can be\nclassified into two distinct categories : one based\non motion, namely kinetic energy; the other on\nconfiguration (position), namely potential energy.\nEnergy comes in many a forms which transform\ninto one another in ways which may not often\nbe clear to us.\n\n6.10.1  Heat\n\nWe have seen that the frictional force is not a\nconservative force. However, work is associated\nwith the force of friction, Example 6.5. A block of\nmass m sliding on a rough horizontal surface\nwith speed v\n\n0\n comes to a halt over a distance x\n\n0\n.\n\nThe work done by the force of kinetic friction f\nover x\n\n0 \nis –f x\n\n0\n.\n \nBy the work-energy theorem\n\n2\no 0m v /2  f  x .=  If we confine our scope to\n\nmechanics, we would say that the kinetic energy\nof the block is ‘lost’ due to the frictional force.\nOn examination of the block and the table we\nwould detect a slight increase in their\ntemperatures. The work done by friction is not\n‘lost’, but is transferred as heat energy. This\nraises the internal energy of the block and the\ntable. In winter, in order to feel warm, we\ngenerate heat by vigorously rubbing our palms\ntogether. We shall see later that the internal\nenergy is associated with the ceaseless, often\nrandom, motion of molecules. A quantitative idea\nof the transfer of heat energy is obtained by\nnoting that 1 kg of water releases about 42000 J\nof energy when it cools by10 °C.\n\n6.10.2   Chemical Energy\n\nOne of the greatest technical achievements of\nhumankind occurred when we discovered how\nto ignite and control fire. We learnt to rub two\nflint stones together (mechanical energy), got\nthem to heat up and to ignite a heap of dry leaves\n(chemical energy), which then provided\nsustained warmth.  A matchstick ignites into a\nbright flame when struck against a specially\nprepared chemical surface. The lighted\nmatchstick, when applied to a firecracker,\nresults in a spectacular display of sound and\nlight.\n\nChemical energy arises from the fact that the\nmolecules participating in the chemical reaction\nhave different binding energies. A stable chemical\ncompound has less energy than the separated parts.\nA chemical reaction is basically a rearrangement\nof atoms. If the total energy of the reactants is more\nthan the products of the reaction, heat is released\nand the reaction is said to be an exothermic\nreaction. If the reverse is true, heat is absorbed and\nthe reaction is endothermic. Coal consists of\ncarbon and a kilogram of it when burnt releases\nabout 3 × 107 J of energy.\n\nChemical energy is associated with the forces\nthat give rise to the stability of substances. These\n\nforces bind atoms into molecules, molecules into\n\npolymeric chains, etc. The chemical energy\n\narising from the combustion of coal, cooking gas,\n\nwood and petroleum is indispensable to our daily\n\nexistence.\n\n6.10.3  Electrical Energy\n\nThe flow of electrical current causes bulbs to\n\nglow, fans to rotate and bells to ring.  There are\n\nlaws governing the attraction and repulsion of\n\ncharges and currents, which we shall learn\n\nlater. Energy is associated with an electric\n\ncurrent. An urban Indian  household consumes\n\nabout 200 J of energy per second on an average.\n\n6.10.4  The Equivalence of Mass and Energy\n\nTill the end of the nineteenth century, physicists\n\nbelieved that in every physical and chemical\n\nprocess, the mass of an isolated system is\n\nconserved. Matter might change its phase, e.g.\n\nglacial ice could melt into a gushing stream, but\n\nmatter is neither created nor destroyed; Albert\n\nEinstein (1879-1955) however, showed that mass\n\nand energy are equivalent and are related by\n\nthe relation\n\nE = m c2 (6.20)\nwhere c, the speed of light in vacuum is\napproximately 3 ×108 m s–1.  Thus, a staggering\namount of energy is associated with a mere\nkilogram of matter\n\nE = 1× (3 ×108)2 J = 9 ×1016 J.\nThis is equivalent to the annual electrical output\nof a large (3000 MW) power generating station.\n\n6.10.5  Nuclear Energy\n\nThe most destructive weapons made by man, the\nfission and fusion bombs are manifestations of\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nWORK, ENERGY AND POWER 127\n\nthe above equivalence of mass and energy [Eq.\n\n(6.20)]. On the other hand the explanation of the\n\nlife-nourishing energy output of the sun is also\n\nbased on the above equation.  In this case\n\neffectively four light hydrogen nuclei fuse to form\n\na helium nucleus whose mass is less than the\n\nsum of the masses of the reactants. This mass\n\ndifference, called the mass defect ∆m  is the\nsource of energy (∆m)c2.  In fission, a heavy\n\nnucleus like uranium U\n235\n92 \n\n, is split by a neutron\n\ninto lighter nuclei.  Once again the final mass is\n\nless than the initial mass and the mass difference\n\ntranslates into energy, which can be tapped to\n\nprovide electrical energy as in nuclear power\n\nplants (controlled nuclear fission) or can be\n\nemployed in making nuclear weapons\n\n(uncontrolled nuclear fission). Strictly, the energy\n\n∆E released in a chemical reaction can also be\nrelated to the mass defect ∆m = ∆E/c2. However,\nfor a chemical reaction, this mass defect is much\n\nsmaller than for a nuclear reaction. Table 6.3\n\nlists the total energies for a variety of events and\n\nphenomena.\n\nTable 6.3   Approximate energy associated with various phenomena\n\nExample 6.10  Examine Tables 6.1-6.3\nand express (a) The energy required to\nbreak one bond in DNA in eV; (b) The\nkinetic energy of an air molecule (10—21 J)\nin eV; (c) The daily intake of a human adult\nin kilocalories.\n\nAnswer  (a) Energy required to break one bond\nof DNA is\n\n \n\n20\n\n19\n\n10 J\n~ 0.06 eV\n\n1.6 10 J/eV\n\n−\n\n−×\n\nNote 0.1 eV = 100 meV (100 millielectron volt).\n\n(b) The kinetic energy of an air molecule is\n\n \n\n21\n\n19\n\n10 J\n~ 0.0062 eV\n\n1.6 10 J/eV\n\n−\n\n−×\n\nThis is the same as 6.2 meV.\n\n(c) The average human consumption in a day is\n\n7\n\n \n3\n\n10 J\n~ 2400 kcal\n\n4.2×10 J/kcal\n\n\uf074\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS128\n\nWe point out a common misconception created\n\nby newspapers and magazines. They mention\n\nfood values in calories and urge us to restrict\n\ndiet intake to below 2400 calories. What they\n\nshould be saying is kilocalories (kcal) and not\n\ncalories. A person consuming 2400 calories a\n\nday will soon starve to death! 1 food calorie is\n\n1 kcal. \uf074\n\n6.10.6 The Principle of Conservation of\nEnergy\n\nWe have seen that the total mechanical energy\n\nof the system is conserved if the forces doing work\n\non it are conservative. If some of the forces\n\ninvolved are non-conservative, part of the\n\nmechanical energy may get transformed into\n\nother forms such as heat, light and sound.\n\nHowever, the total energy of an isolated system\n\ndoes not change, as long as one accounts for all\n\nforms of energy.  Energy may be transformed from\n\none form to another but the total energy of an\n\nisolated system remains constant. Energy can\n\nneither be created, nor destroyed.\n\nSince the universe as a whole may be viewed\n\nas an isolated system, the total energy of the\n\nuniverse is constant. If one part of the universe\n\nloses energy, another part must gain an equal\n\namount of energy.\n\nThe principle of conservation of energy cannot\n\nbe proved. However, no violation of this principle\n\nhas been observed.  The concept of conservation\n\nand transformation of energy into various forms\n\nlinks together various branches of physics,\n\nchemistry and life sciences. It provides a\n\nunifying, enduring element in our scientific\n\npursuits. From engineering point of view all\n\nelectronic, communication and mechanical\n\ndevices rely on some forms of energy\n\ntransformation.\n\n6.11  POWER\n\nOften it is interesting to know not only the work\ndone on an object, but also the rate at which\nthis work is done. We say a person is physically\nfit if he not only climbs four floors of a building\nbut climbs them fast. Power is defined as the\ntime rate at which work is done or energy is\ntransferred.\n\nThe average power of a force is defined as the\nratio of the work, W, to the total time t taken\n\nP\nW\n\nt\nav\n\n=\n\nThe instantaneous power is defined as the\nlimiting value of the average power as time\ninterval approaches zero,\n\nd\n\nd\n\nW\nP\n\nt\n= (6.21)\n\nThe work dW done by a force F for a displacement\ndr is dW = F.dr.  The instantaneous power can\nalso be expressed as\n\nd\n\nd\nP\n\nt\n= F.\n\nr\n\n= F.v (6.22)\n\nwhere v is the instantaneous velocity when the\nforce is F.\n\nPower, like work and energy, is a scalar\nquantity.  Its dimensions are [ML2T–3]. In the SI,\nits unit is called a watt (W).  The watt is 1 J s–1.\nThe unit of power is named after James Watt,\none of the innovators of the steam engine in the\neighteenth century.\n\nThere is another unit of power, namely the\nhorse-power (hp)\n\n1 hp = 746 W\nThis unit is still used to describe the output of\nautomobiles, motorbikes, etc.\n\nWe encounter the unit watt when we buy\nelectrical goods such as bulbs, heaters and\nrefrigerators.  A 100 watt bulb which is on for 10\nhours uses 1 kilowatt hour (kWh) of energy.\n\n100 (watt) × 10 (hour)\n= 1000 watt hour\n=1 kilowatt hour (kWh)\n= 103 (W) × 3600 (s)\n= 3.6 × 106 J\n\nOur electricity bills carry the energy\nconsumption in units of kWh.  Note that kWh is\na unit of energy and not of power.\n\nExample 6.11  An elevator can carry a\nmaximum load of 1800 kg (elevator +\npassengers) is moving up with a constant\nspeed of 2 m s–1. The frictional force opposing\nthe motion is 4000 N. Determine the\nminimum power delivered by the motor to\nthe elevator in watts as well as in horse\npower.\n\n\uf075\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nWORK, ENERGY AND POWER 129\n\nAnswer  The downward force on the elevator is\n\nF = m g + F\nf\n = (1800 × 10) + 4000 = 22000 N\n\nThe motor must supply enough power to balance\nthis force.  Hence,\n\nP = F. v = 22000 × 2 = 44000 W = 59 hp        \uf020\uf074\n\n6.12  COLLISIONS\n\nIn physics we study motion (change in position).\nAt the same time, we try to discover physical\nquantities, which do not change in a physical\nprocess. The laws of momentum and energy\nconservation are typical examples. In this\nsection we shall apply these laws to a commonly\nencountered phenomena, namely collisions.\nSeveral games such as billiards, marbles or\ncarrom involve collisions.We shall study the\ncollision of two masses in an idealised form.\n\nConsider two masses m\n1\n and m\n\n2\n.  The particle\n\nm\n1\n is moving with speed v\n\n1i \n, the subscript ‘i’\n\nimplying initial. We can cosider m\n2\n  to be at rest.\n\nNo loss of generality is involved in making such\na selection. In this situation the  mass m\n\n1\n\ncollides  with  the stationary  mass m\n2\n  and  this\n\nis depicted in  Fig. 6.10.\n\nFig. 6.10 Collision of mass m\n1\n, with a stationary mass m\n\n2\n.\n\nThe masses m\n1\n and m\n\n2\n fly-off in different\n\ndirections.  We shall see that there are\nrelationships, which connect the masses, the\nvelocities and the angles.\n\n6.12.1  Elastic and  Inelastic Collisions\n\nIn all collisions the total linear momentum is\nconserved; the initial momentum of the system\nis equal to the final momentum of the system.\nOne can argue this as follows.  When two objects\ncollide, the mutual impulsive forces acting over\nthe collision time ∆t cause a change in their\nrespective momenta :\n\n∆p\n1 \n= F\n\n12  \n∆t\n\n∆p\n2 \n= F\n\n21  \n∆t\n\nwhere F\n12\n\n is  the force exerted on the first particle\n\nby the second particle. F\n21 \n\nis likewise the force\nexerted on the second particle by the first particle.\nNow from Newton’s third law, F\n\n12\n = − F\n\n21\n.  This\n\nimplies\n\n∆p\n1 \n+ ∆p\n\n2 \n=  0\n\nThe above conclusion is true even though the\nforces vary in a complex fashion during the\ncollision time ∆t. Since the third law is true at\nevery instant, the total impulse on the first object\nis equal and opposite to that on the second.\n\nOn the other hand, the total kinetic energy of\nthe system is not necessarily conserved. The\nimpact and deformation during collision may\ngenerate heat and sound. Part of the initial kinetic\nenergy is transformed into other forms of energy.\nA useful way to visualise the deformation during\ncollision is in terms of a ‘compressed spring’. If\nthe ‘spring’ connecting the two masses regains\nits original shape without loss in energy, then\nthe initial kinetic energy is equal to the final\nkinetic energy but the kinetic energy during the\ncollision time ∆t is not constant. Such a collision\nis called an elastic collision. On the other hand\nthe deformation may not be relieved and the two\nbodies could move together after the collision. A\ncollision in which the two particles move together\nafter the collision is called a completely inelastic\ncollision. The intermediate case where the\ndeformation is partly relieved and some of the\ninitial kinetic energy is lost is more common and\nis appropriately called an inelastic collision.\n\n6.12.2  Collisions in One Dimension\n\nConsider first a completely inelastic collision\nin one dimension. Then,  in Fig. 6.10,\n\n θ \n1\n = θ \n\n2\n = 0\n\n m\n1\nv\n\n1i\n = (m\n\n1\n+m\n\n2\n)v\n\nf  \n  (momentum conservation)\n\n \n1\n\n1\n\n1 2\n\nf i\n\nm\nv v\n\nm m\n=\n\n+                             (6.23)\n\nThe loss in kinetic energy on collision is\n\n2 2\n1 1 2\n\n1 1\n\n2 2\n1i fK m v m m v∆ = − +( )\n\n    \n\n2\n2 21\n\n1 1 1\n\n1 2\n\n1 1\n\n2 2\ni i\n\nm\nm v v\n\n m m\n= −\n\n+\n    [using Eq.

Using the\nabove nomenclature with θ\n\n1\n = θ\n\n2\n = 0, the\n\nmomentum and kinetic energy conservation\nequations are\n\nm\n1\nv\n\n1i\n = m\n\n1\nv\n\n1f\n + m\n\n2\nv\n\n2f\n(6.24)\n\n2 2 2\n1 1 1 1 2 2i f fm v m v m v= + (6.25)\n\nFrom  Eqs. (6.24)  and (6.25) it follows that,\n\n1 1 2 1 1 1 2 1( ) ( )i f i f f fm v v v m v v v− = −\n\nor,\n2 2\n\n2 1 1 1 1( )f i f i fv v v v v− = −\n\n1 1 1 1( )( )i f i fv v v v= − +\n\nHence,  2 1 1f i fv v v∴ = + (6.26)\n\nSubstituting this in Eq. (6.24), we obtain\n\n1 2\n1 1\n\n1 2\n\n( )\nf i\n\nm m\nv v\n\nm m\n\n−\n=\n\n+ (6.27)\n\nand\n1 1\n\n2\n\n1 2\n\n2 i\nf\n\nm v\nv\n\nm m\n=\n\n+ (6.28)\n\nThus, the ‘unknowns’ {v\n1f\n, v\n\n2f\n} are obtained in\n\nterms of the ‘knowns’ {m\n1\n, m\n\n2\n, v\n\n1i\n}. Special cases\n\nof our analysis are interesting.\n\nCase I : If the two masses are equal\n\nv\n1f\n = 0\n\nv\n2f\n =  v\n\n1i\n\nThe first mass comes to rest and pushes off the\nsecond mass with its initial speed on collision.\n\nCase II : If one mass dominates, e.g. m\n2\n > > m\n\n1\n\nv\n1f\n  ~ − v\n\n1i\n      v\n\n2f\n ~ 0\n\nThe heavier mass is undisturbed while the\nlighter mass reverses its velocity.\n\nExample 6.12  Slowing down of neutrons:\nIn a nuclear reactor a neutron of high\nspeed (typically 107 m s–1) must be slowed\n\nAn experiment on head-on collision\n\nIn performing an experiment on collision on a horizontal surface, we face three difficulties.\nOne, there will be friction and bodies will not travel with uniform velocities. Two, if two bodies\nof different sizes collide on a table, it would be difficult to arrange them for a head-on collision\nunless their centres of mass are at the same height above the surface. Three, it will be fairly\ndifficult to measure velocities of the two bodies just before and just after collision.\n\nBy performing this experiment in a vertical direction, all the three difficulties vanish. Take\ntwo balls, one of which is heavier (basketball/football/volleyball) and the other lighter (tennis\nball/rubber ball/table tennis ball). First take only the heavier ball and drop it vertically from\nsome height, say 1 m. Note to which it rises. This gives the velocities near the floor or ground,\n\njust before and just after the bounce (by using 2 2v gh= ). Hence you\n\nwill get the coefficient of restitution.\nNow take the big ball and a small ball and hold them in your\n\nhands one over the other, with the heavier ball below the lighter\none, as shown here. Drop them together, taking care that they remain\ntogether while falling, and see what happens. You will find that the\nheavier ball rises less than when it was dropped alone, while the\nlighter one shoots up to about 3 m. With practice, you will be able to\nhold the ball properly so that the lighter ball rises vertically up and\ndoes not fly sideways. This is head-on collision.\n\nYou can try to find the best combination of balls which gives you\nthe best effect. You can measure the masses on a standard balance.\nWe leave it to you to think how you can determine the initial and\nfinal velocities of the balls.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nWORK, ENERGY AND POWER 131\n\n\uf074\n\nto 103 m s–1 so that it can have a high\n\nprobability of interacting with isotope \n92\n\n235\nU\n\nand causing it to fission.

For\ncarbon f\n\n1\n = 71.6% and f\n\n2\n = 28.4%.  In practice,\n\nhowever, this number is smaller since head-on\ncollisions are rare. \uf074\n\nIf the initial velocities and final velocities of\nboth the bodies are along the same straight line,\nthen it is called a one-dimensional collision, or\nhead-on collision. In the case of small spherical\nbodies, this is possible if the direction of travel\nof body 1 passes through the centre of body 2\nwhich is at rest. In general, the collision is two-\ndimensional, where the initial velocities and the\nfinal velocities lie in a plane.\n\n6.12.3  Collisions in Two Dimensions\n\nFig. 6.10 also depicts the collision of a moving\n\nmass m\n1\n with the stationary mass m\n\n2\n. Linear\n\nmomentum is conserved in such a collision.\n\nSince momentum is a vector this implies three\n\nequations for the three directions {x, y, z}.\n\nConsider the plane determined by the final\n\nvelocity directions of m\n1 \nand m\n\n2 \nand choose it to\n\nbe the x-y plane. The conservation of the\n\nz-component of the linear momentum implies\n\nthat the entire collision is in the x-y plane. The\n\nx- and y-component equations are\n\nm\n1\nv\n\n1i\n = m\n\n1\nv\n\n1f\n cos θ \n\n1\n + m\n\n2\nv\n\n2f\n cos θ \n\n2\n     (6.29)\n\n0  = m\n1\nv\n\n1f\n  sin θ\n\n1\n −  m\n\n2\nv\n\n2f\n sin θ\n\n2\n        (6.30)\n\nOne knows {m\n1\n, m\n\n2\n, v\n\n1i\n} in most situations.  There\n\nare thus four unknowns {v\n1f\n\n, v\n2f\n\n, θ\n1 \nand θ\n\n2\n}, and\n\nonly two equations. If θ \n1 \n\n=\n \nθ \n\n2 \n= 0, we regain\n\nEq.

That still\nleaves us one equation short.  At least one of\nthe four unknowns, say θ \n\n1\n, must be made known\n\nfor the problem to be solvable. For example, θ\n1\n\ncan be determined by moving a detector in an\nangular fashion from the x  to the y  axis. Given\n{m\n\n1\n, m\n\n2\n, v\n\n1i\n, θ\n\n1\n} we can determine {v\n\n1f\n, v\n\n2f\n, θ\n\n2\n}\n\nfrom Eqs.

This is what happens\n\nin the games of marbles, carrom and billiards.\n\nIn our everyday world, collisions take place only\n\nwhen two bodies touch each other. But consider\n\na comet coming from far distances to the sun, or\n\nalpha particle coming towards a nucleus and\n\ngoing away in some direction. Here we have to\n\ndeal with forces involving action at a distance.\n\nSuch an event is called scattering. The velocities\n\nand directions in which the two particles go away\n\ndepend on their initial velocities as well as the\n\ntype of interaction between them, their masses,\n\nshapes and sizes.\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. The work-energy theorem states  that  the change in kinetic energy of a body is the work\ndone by the net force on the body.\n\nK\nf\n - K\n\ni\n = W\n\nnet\n\n2. A  force is conservative if (i) work done by it on an object is path  independent and\ndepends only on the end points {x\n\ni\n, x\n\nj\n}, or (ii) the work done by the force is zero for an\n\narbitrary closed path taken by the object such that it returns to its initial position.\n3. For a conservative force in one dimension, we may define a potential energy function V(x)\n\nsuch that\n\nF x\nV x\n\nx\n( ) = −\n\n( )d\nd\n\nor V V = F x  xi f\nx\n\nx\n\ni\n\nf\n\n− ( )∫ d\n\n4. The principle of conservation of mechanical energy states that the total mechanical\nenergy of a body remains constant if the only forces that act on the body are conservative.\n\n5. The gravitational potential energy of a particle of mass m at a height x  about the earth’s\nsurface is\n\nV(x) = m g x\nwhere the variation of g with height is ignored.\n\n6. The elastic potential energy of a spring of force constant k  and extension x is\n\nV x    k x( ) =\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n7. The scalar or dot product of two vectors A and B is written as A.B  and is a scalar\nquantity given by : A.B = AB cos θ,  where θ  is the angle between A and B.  It can be\npositive, negative or zero depending upon the value of θ. The scalar product of two\nvectors can be interpreted as the product of magnitude of one vector and component\nof the other vector along the first vector. For unit vectors :\n\nˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆi i j j k k⋅ = ⋅ = ⋅ = 1 and ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆi j j k k i⋅ = ⋅ = ⋅ = 0\nScalar products obey the commutative and  the distributive laws.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nWORK, ENERGY AND POWER 133\n\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n\n1. The phrase ‘calculate the work done’ is incomplete. We should refer (or imply\nclearly by context) to the work done by a specific force or a group of forces on a\ngiven  body over a certain displacement.\n\n2. Work done is a scalar quantity. It can be positive or negative unlike mass and\nkinetic energy which are positive scalar quantities. The work done by the friction\nor viscous force on a moving body is negative.\n\n3. For two bodies, the sum of the mutual forces exerted between them is zero from\nNewton’s Third Law,\n\nF\n12  \n\n+  F\n21 \n\n =  0\n\nBut the sum of the work done by the two forces need not always cancel, i.e.\n\nW\n12  \n\n+ W\n21  \n\n≠  0\n\nHowever, it may sometimes be true.\n4. The work done by a force can be calculated sometimes even if the exact nature of\n\nthe force is not known. This is clear from Example 6.2 where the WE theorem is\nused in such a situation.\n\n5. The WE theorem is not independent of Newton’s Second Law. The WE theorem\nmay be viewed as a scalar form of the Second Law. The principle of conservation\nof mechanical energy may be viewed as a consequence of the  WE theorem for\nconservative forces.\n\n6. The WE theorem holds in all inertial frames. It can also be extended to non-\ninertial frames provided we include the pseudoforces in the calculation of the\nnet force acting on the body under consideration.\n\n7. The potential energy of a body subjected to a conservative force is always\nundetermined upto a constant. For example, the point where the potential\nenergy is zero is a matter of choice. For the gravitational  potential energy mgh,\nthe zero of the potential energy is chosen to be the ground. For the spring\npotential energy kx2/2 , the zero of the potential energy is the equilibrium position\nof the oscillating mass.\n\n8. Every force encountered in mechanics does not have an associated potential\nenergy. For example, work done by friction over a closed path is not zero and no\npotential energy can be associated with friction.\n\n9. During a collision : (a) the total linear momentum is conserved at each instant of\nthe collision ; (b) the kinetic energy conservation (even if the collision is  elastic)\napplies after the collision is over and does not hold at every instant of the collision.\nIn fact the two colliding objects are deformed and may be momentarily at rest\nwith respect to each other.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS134\n\nEXERCISES\n\n6.1 The sign of work done by a force on a body is important to understand.

A woman standing with a very heavy load on\nher head may get very tired.  But no mechanical work is involved.\nThat is not to say that mechanical work cannot be estimated in\nordinary human activity.\n\nConsider a person walking with constant speed v\n0\n. The mechanical work he does may be estimated simply\n\nwith the help of the work-energy theorem. Assume :\n(a) The major work done in walking is due to the acceleration and deceleration of the legs with each stride\n\n(See Fig. 6.20).\n(b) Neglect air resistance.\n(c) Neglect the small work done in lifting the legs against gravity.\n(d) Neglect the swinging of hands etc. as is common in walking.\n\nAs we can see in Fig. 6.20, in each stride the leg is brought from rest to a speed, approximately equal to the\nspeed of walking, and then brought to rest again.\n\nFig. 6.20 An illustration of a single stride in walking. While the first leg is maximally off the round, the second leg\nis on the ground and vice-versa\n\nThe work done by one leg in each stride is 2\n0l v m   by the work-energy theorem. Here ml  is the mass of the leg.\n\nNote 2/\n2\n0l v m  energy is expended by one set of leg muscles to bring the foot from rest to speed v0 while an\n\nadditional 2/\n2\n0l v m   is expended by a complementary set of leg muscles to bring the foot to rest from speed v0.\n\nHence work done by both legs in one stride is (study Fig. 6.20 carefully)\n\n2\n0ls v mW 2= (6.34)\n\nAssuming mass of the leg m\nl \n= 10 kg and slow running with a speed of 10 km in a hour which translates to\n\napproximately 3 m s-1, we obtain\n\nW\ns\n\n= 180 J /stride\n\nIf we take a stride to be 2 m long, the person covers 1.5 strides per second at his speed of  3 m s-1.  Thus the\npower expended\n\n     \n\n        =  270 W\n\nWe must bear in mind that this is a lower estimate since several avenues of power loss (e.g. swinging of hands,\nair resistance etc.) have been ignored.  The interesting point is that we did not worry about the forces involved.\nThe forces, mainly friction and those exerted on the leg by the muscles of the rest of the body, are hard to\nestimate. Static friction does no work and we bypassed the impossible task of estimating the work done by the\nmuscles by taking recourse to the work-energy theorem. We can also see the advantage of a wheel. The wheel\npermits smooth locomotion without the continual starting and stopping in mammalian locomotion.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n\n')('status', 200)
