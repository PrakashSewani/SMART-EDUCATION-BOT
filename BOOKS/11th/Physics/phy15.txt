What happens in a system, which is\n\na collection of such objects? A material medium provides\n\nsuch an example. Here, elastic forces bind the constituents\n\nto each other and, therefore, the motion of one affects that of\n\nthe other. If you drop a little pebble in a pond of still water,\n\nthe water surface gets disturbed. The disturbance does not\n\nremain confined to one place, but propagates outward along\n\na circle. If you continue dropping pebbles in the pond, you\n\nsee circles rapidly moving outward from the point where the\n\nwater surface is disturbed. It gives a feeling as if the water is\n\nmoving outward from the point of disturbance. If you put\n\nsome cork pieces on the disturbed surface, it is seen that\n\nthe cork pieces move up and down but do not move away\n\nfrom the centre of disturbance. This shows that the water\n\nmass does not flow outward with the circles, but rather a\n\nmoving disturbance is created. Similarly, when we speak,\n\nthe sound moves outward from us, without any flow of air\n\nfrom one part of the medium to another. The disturbances\n\nproduced in air are much less obvious and only our ears or\n\na microphone can detect them. These patterns, which move\n\nwithout the actual physical transfer or flow of matter as a\n\nwhole, are called waves. In this Chapter, we will study such\nwaves.\n\nWaves transport energy and the pattern of disturbance has\ninformation that propagate from one point to another. All our\ncommunications essentially depend on transmission of sig-\nnals through waves. Speech means production of sound\nwaves in air and hearing amounts to their detection. Often,\ncommunication involves different kinds of waves. For exam-\nple, sound waves may be first converted into an electric cur-\nrent signal which in turn may generate an electromagnetic\nwave that may be transmitted by an optical cable or via a\n\n15.1 Introduction\n\n15.2 Transverse and\nlongitudinal waves\n\n15.3 Displacement relation in a\nprogressive wave\n\n15.4 The speed of a travelling\nwave\n\n15.5 The principle of\nsuperposition of waves\n\n15.6 Reflection of waves\n\n15.7 Beats\n\n15.8 Doppler effect\n\nSummary\n\nPoints to ponder\n\nExercises\n\nAdditional exercises\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS368\n\nsatellite. Detection of the original signal will usu-\nally involve these steps in reverse order.\n\nNot all waves require a medium for their\n\npropagation. We know that light waves can\n\ntravel through vacuum. The light emitted by\n\nstars, which are hundreds of light years away,\n\nreaches us through inter-stellar space, which\n\nis practically a vacuum.\nThe most familiar type of waves such as waves\n\non a string, water waves, sound waves, seismic\nwaves, etc. is the so-called mechanical waves.\nThese waves require a medium for propagation,\nthey cannot propagate through vacuum. They\ninvolve oscillations of constituent particles and\ndepend on the elastic properties of the medium.\nThe electromagnetic waves that you will learn\nin Class XII are a different type of wave.\nElectromagnetic waves do not necessarily require\na medium - they can travel through vacuum.\nLight, radiowaves, X-rays, are all electromagnetic\nwaves. In vacuum, all electromagnetic waves\nhave the same speed c, whose value is :\n\nc = 299, 792, 458 ms–1. (15.1)\n\nA third kind of wave is the so-called Matter\nwaves. They are associated with constituents of\nmatter : electrons, protons, neutrons, atoms and\nmolecules. They arise in quantum mechanical\ndescription of nature that you will learn in your\nlater studies. Though conceptually more abstract\nthan mechanical or electro-magnetic waves, they\nhave already found applications in several\ndevices basic to modern technology; matter\nwaves associated with electrons are employed\n\nin electron microscopes.\n\nIn this chapter we will study mechanical\n\nwaves, which require a material medium for\n\ntheir propagation.\n\nThe aesthetic influence of waves on art and\n\nliterature is seen from very early times; yet the\n\nfirst scientific analysis of wave motion dates back\nto the seventeenth century. Some of the famous\nscientists associated with the physics of wave\nmotion are Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695),\nRobert Hooke and Isaac Newton. The\nunderstanding of physics of waves followed the\nphysics of oscillations of masses tied to springs\nand physics of the simple pendulum. Waves in\nelastic media are intimately connected with\nharmonic oscillations. (Stretched strings, coiled\nsprings, air, etc., are examples of elastic media).\n\nWe shall illustrate this connection through\nsimple examples.\n\nConsider a collection of springs connected to\none another as shown in Fig. 15.1. If the spring\nat one end is pulled suddenly and released, the\ndisturbance travels to the other end. What has\n\nhappened? The first spring is disturbed from its\nequilibrium length. Since the second spring is\nconnected to the first, it is also stretched or\ncompressed, and so on. The disturbance moves\nfrom one end to the other; but each spring only\nexecutes small oscillations about its equilibrium\nposition. As a practical example of this situation,\nconsider a stationary train at a railway station.\nDifferent bogies of the train are coupled to each\nother through a spring coupling. When an\nengine is attached at one end, it gives a push to\nthe bogie next to it; this push is transmitted from\none bogie to another without the entire train\nbeing bodily displaced.\n\nNow let us consider the propagation of sound\n\nwaves in air. As the wave passes through air, it\n\ncompresses or expands a small region of air. This\n\ncauses a change in the density of that region,\n\nsay δρ, this change induces a change in pressure,\nδp, in that region. Pressure is force per unit area,\nso there is a restoring force proportional to\nthe disturbance, just like in a spring. In this\n\ncase, the quantity similar to extension or\n\ncompression of the spring is the change in\n\ndensity. If a region is compressed, the molecules\n\nin that region are packed together, and they tend\nto move out to the adjoining region, thereby\n\nincreasing the density or creating compression\n\nin the adjoining region. Consequently, the air\n\nin the first region undergoes rarefaction. If a\nregion is comparatively rarefied the surrounding\nair will rush in making the rarefaction move to\nthe adjoining region. Thus, the compression or\nrarefaction moves from one region to another,\nmaking the propagation of a disturbance\npossible in air.\n\nFig. 15.1 A collection of springs connected to each\nother. The end A is pulled suddenly\n\ngenerating a disturbance, which then\n\npropagates to the other end.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nWAVES 369\n\nIn solids, similar arguments can be made. In\na crystalline solid, atoms or group of atoms are\narranged in a periodic lattice. In these, each\natom or group of atoms is in equilibrium, due to\nforces from the surrounding atoms. Displacing\none atom, keeping the others fixed, leads to\nrestoring forces, exactly as in a spring. So we\ncan think of atoms in a lattice as end points,\nwith springs between pairs of them.\n\nIn the subsequent sections of this chapter\nwe are going to discuss various characteristic\nproperties of waves.\n\n15.2 TRANSVERSE AND LONGITUDINAL\nWAVES\n\nWe have seen that motion of mechanical waves\ninvolves oscillations of constituents of the\nmedium. If the constituents of the medium\noscillate perpendicular to the direction of wave\npropagation, we call the wave a transverse wave.\nIf they oscillate along the direction of wave\npropagation, we call the wave a longitudinal\nwave.\n\nFig.15.2 shows the propagation of a single\npulse along a string, resulting from a single up\nand down jerk. If the string is very long compared\n\nposition as the pulse or wave passes through\nthem. The oscillations are normal to the\ndirection of wave motion along the string, so this\nis an example of transverse wave.\n\nWe can look at a wave in two ways. We can fix\nan instant of time and picture the wave in space.\nThis will give us the shape of the wave as a\nwhole in space at a given instant. Another way\nis to fix a location i.e. fix our attention on a\nparticular element of string and see its\noscillatory motion in time.\n\nFig. 15.4 describes the situation for\nlongitudinal waves in the most familiar example\nof the propagation of sound waves. A long pipe\nfilled with air has a piston at one end. A single\nsudden push forward and pull back of the piston\nwill generate a pulse of condensations (higher\ndensity) and rarefactions (lower density) in the\nmedium (air). If the  push-pull of the piston is\ncontinuous and periodic (sinusoidal), a\n\nFig. 15.3 A harmonic (sinusoidal) wave travelling\nalong a stretched string is an example of a\ntransverse wave. An element of the string\nin the region of the wave oscillates about\nits equilibrium position perpendicular to the\ndirection of wave propagation.\n\nFig. 15.2 When a pulse travels along the length of a\nstretched string (x-direction), the elements\n\nof the string oscillate up and down (y-\n\ndirection)\n\nto the size of the pulse, the pulse will damp out\nbefore it reaches the other end and reflection\nfrom that end may be ignored. Fig. 15.3 shows a\nsimilar situation, but this time the external\nagent gives a continuous periodic sinusoidal up\nand down jerk to one end of the string. The\nresulting disturbance on the string is then a\nsinusoidal wave. In either case the elements of\nthe string oscillate about their equilibrium mean\n\nFig. 15.4 Longitudinal waves (sound) generated in a\npipe filled with air by moving the piston up\n\nand down. A volume element of air oscillates\n\nin the direction parallel to the direction of\n\nwave propagation.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS370\n\nsinusoidal wave will be generated propagating\nin air along the length of the pipe. This is clearly\nan example of longitudinal waves.\n\nThe waves considered above, transverse or\n\nlongitudinal, are travelling or progressive waves\n\nsince they travel from one part of the medium\n\nto another. The material medium as a whole\n\ndoes not move, as already noted. A stream, for\n\nexample, constitutes motion of water as a whole.\n\nIn a water wave, it is the disturbance that moves,\n\nnot water as a whole. Likewise a wind (motion\n\nof air as a whole) should not be confused with a\n\nsound wave which is a propagation of\n\ndisturbance (in pressure density) in air, without\n\nthe motion of air medium as a whole.\n\nIn transverse waves, the particle motion is\n\nnormal to the direction of propagation of the\n\nwave. Therefore, as the wave propagates, each\n\nelement of the medium undergoes a shearing\n\nstrain. Transverse waves can, therefore, be\n\npropagated only in those media, which can\n\nsustain shearing stress, such as solids and not\n\nin fluids. Fluids, as well as, solids can sustain\n\ncompressive strain; therefore, longitudinal\n\nwaves can be propagated in all elastic media.\n\nFor example, in medium like steel, both\n\ntransverse and longitudinal waves can\n\npropagate, while air can sustain only\n\nlongitudinal waves. The waves on the surface\n\nof water are of two kinds: capillary waves and\n\ngravity waves. The former are ripples of fairly\n\nshort wavelength—not more than a few\n\ncentimetre—and the restoring force that\n\nproduces them is the surface tension of water.\n\nGravity waves have wavelengths typically\n\nranging from several metres to several hundred\n\nmeters. The restoring force that produces these\n\nwaves is the pull of gravity, which tends to keep\n\nthe water surface at its lowest level. The\n\noscillations of the particles in these waves are\n\nnot confined to the surface only, but extend with\n\ndiminishing amplitude to the very bottom. The\n\nparticle motion in water waves involves a\n\ncomplicated motion—they not only move up and\n\ndown but also back and forth. The waves in an\n\nocean are the combination of both longitudinal\n\nand transverse waves.\n\nIt is found that, generally, transverse and\nlongitudinal waves travel with different speed\nin the same medium.\n\nuuuuu Example 15.1  Given below are some\nexamples of wave motion. State in each case\nif the wave motion is transverse, longitudinal\nor a combination of both:\n(a) Motion of a kink in a longitudinal spring\n\nproduced by displacing one end of the\nspring sideways.\n\n(b) Waves produced in a cylinder\ncontaining a liquid by moving its piston\nback and forth.\n\n(c) Waves produced by a motorboat sailing\nin water.\n\n(d) Ultrasonic waves in air produced by a\nvibrating quartz crystal.\n\nAnswer\n(a) Transverse and longitudinal\n(b) Longitudinal\n(c) Transverse and longitudinal\n(d) Longitudinal t\n\n15.3 DISPLACEMENT RELATION IN\nA  PROGRESSIVE WAVE\n\nFor mathematical description of  a travelling\nwave, we need a function of both position x and\ntime t. Such a function at every instant should\ngive the shape of the wave at that instant. Also,\nat every given location, it should describe the\nmotion of the constituent of the medium at that\nlocation. If we wish to describe a sinusoidal\ntravelling wave (such as the one shown in Fig.\n15.3) the corresponding function must also be\nsinusoidal. For convenience, we shall take the\nwave to be transverse so that if the position of\nthe constituents of the medium is denoted by x,\nthe displacement from the equilibrium position\nmay be denoted by y. A sinusoidal travelling\nwave is then described by:\n\n( , ) sin( )= − ω + φy x t a kx t (15.2)\nThe term φ in the argument of sine function\n\nmeans equivalently that we are considering a\nlinear combination of sine and cosine functions:\n\n( , ) sin( ) cos( )y x t A kx t B kx tω ω= − + − (15.3)\nFrom Equations (15.2) and (15.3),\n\n2 2\na A B= +  and  \n\n1tanφ −=\nB\n\nA\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\nTo understand why Equation (15.2)\nrepresents a sinusoidal travelling wave, take a\nfixed instant,  say t = t\n\n0\n. Then, the argument of\n\nthe sine function in Equation (15.2) is simply\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nWAVES 371\n\nkx + constant. Thus, the shape of the wave (at\n\nany fixed instant) as a function of x  is a sine\nwave. Similarly, take a fixed location, say x = x\n\n0\n.\n\nThen, the argument of the sine function in\nEquation (15.2) is constant -ωt. The\ndisplacement y, at a fixed location, thus, varies\nsinusoidally with time. That is, the constituents\nof the medium at different positions execute\nsimple harmonic motion. Finally, as t increases,\nx must increase in the positive direction to keep\nkx – ωt + φ  constant. Thus, Eq. (15.2) represents\na sinusiodal (harmonic) wave travelling along\nthe positive direction of the x-axis. On the other\nhand, a function\n\n( , ) sin( )= + ω + φy x t a kx t  (15.4)\nrepresents a wave travelling in the negative\ndirection of x-axis. Fig. (15.5) gives the names of\nthe various physical quantities appearing in Eq.\n(15.2) that we now interpret.\n\n    Fig. 15.6 shows the plots of Eq. (15.2) for\ndifferent values of time differing by equal\nintervals of time. In a wave, the crest is the\npoint of maximum positive displacement, the\ntrough is the point of maximum negative\ndisplacement. To see how a wave travels, we\ncan fix attention on a crest and see how it\nprogresses with time. In the figure, this is\nshown by a cross (×) on the crest. In the same\nmanner, we can see the motion of a particular\nconstituent of the medium at a fixed location,\nsay at the origin of the x-axis. This is shown\nby a solid dot (•). The plots of Fig. 15.6 show\nthat with time, the solid dot (•) at the origin\nmoves periodically, i.e., the particle at the\norigin oscillates about its mean position as\nthe wave progresses. This is true for any other\nlocation also. We also see that during the time\nthe solid dot (•) has completed one full\noscillation, the crest has moved further by a\ncertain distance.\n\nUsing the plots of Fig. 15.6, we now define\nthe various quantities of Eq. (15.2).\n\n15.3.1  Amplitude and Phase\n\nIn Eq. (15.2), since the sine function varies\n\nbetween 1 and –1, the displacement y (x,t) varies\n\nbetween a and –a. We can take a to be a positive\n\nconstant, without any loss of generality. Then,\n\na represents the maximum displacement of the\n\nconstituents of the medium from their\n\nequilibrium position. Note that the displacement\n\ny may be positive or negative, but a is positive.\n\nIt is called the amplitude of the wave.\n\nThe quantity (kx – ωt + φ) appearing as the\nargument of the sine function in Eq. (15.2) is\n\ncalled the phase of the wave. Given the\n\namplitude a, the phase determines the\n\ndisplacement of the wave at any position and\n\nat any instant. Clearly φ is the phase at x = 0\nand t = 0. Hence, φ is called the initial phase\nangle. By suitable choice of origin on the x-axis\n\nand the intial time, it is possible to have φ = 0.\nThus there is no loss of generality in dropping\n\nφ, i.e., in taking Eq. (15.2) with φ = 0.\n\nFig. 15.5 The meaning of standard symbols in\nEq. (15.2)\n\ny(x,t) : displacement as a function of\nposition x and time t\n\na : amplitude of a wave\nω : angular frequency of the wave\nk : angular wave number\nkx–ωt+φ : initial phase angle (a+x = 0, t = 0)\n\nFig. 15.6 A harmonic wave progressing along the\npositive direction of x-axis at different times.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS372\n\n15.3.2  Wavelength and Angular Wave\nNumber\n\nThe minimum distance between two points\n\nhaving the same phase is called the wavelength\n\nof the wave, usually denoted by λ. For simplicity,\nwe can choose points of the same phase to be\n\ncrests or troughs. The wavelength is then the\n\ndistance between two consecutive crests or\n\ntroughs in a wave. Taking  φ = 0 in Eq. (15.2),\nthe displacement at  t = 0 is given by\n\n( , 0) sin=y x a kx      (15.5)\n\nSince the sine function repeats its value after\nevery 2π change in angle,\n\nsin sin( ) sinkx kx n k x\nn\n\nk\n= + = +\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n2\n2\n\nπ\nπ\n\nThat is the displacements at points x and at\n\n2n\nx\n\nk\n\nπ\n+\n\nare the same, where n=1,2,3,... The 1east\ndistance between points with the same\ndisplacement (at any given instant of time) is\nobtained by taking n = 1. λ  is then given by\n\n2\n\nk\n\nπ\nλ =      or   \n\n2\nk\n\nπ\nλ\n\n=     (15.6)\n\nk is the angular wave number or propagation\nconstant; its SI unit is radian per metre or\n\n1\n rad m\n\n− *\n\n15.3.3 Period, Angular Frequency and\n\nFrequency\n\nFig. 15.7 shows again a sinusoidal plot. It\n\ndescribes not the shape of the wave at a certain\n\ninstant but the displacement of an element (at\n\nany fixed location) of the medium as a function\n\nof time. We may for, simplicity, take Eq. (15.2)\n\nwith φ = 0 and monitor the motion of the element\nsay at 0x = . We then get\n\n(0, ) sin( )y t a tω= −\n\n   sina tω= −\n\nNow, the period of oscillation of the wave is the\ntime it takes for an element to complete one full\noscillation. That is\n\nsin sin ( T)a t a tω ω− = − +\n   sin( T)a tω ω= − +\n\nSince sine function repeats after every 2π ,\n\nT 2ω π=   or   \n2\n\nT\n\nπ\nω = (15.7)\n\nω  is called the angular frequency of the wave.\nIts SI unit is rad s –1. The frequency ν is the\nnumber of oscillations per second. Therefore,\n\n1\n\nT 2\n\nω\nν\n\nπ\n= =  (15.8)\n\nν  is usually measured in hertz.\nIn the discussion above, reference has always\n\nbeen made to a wave travelling along a string or\n\na transverse wave. In a longitudinal wave, the\n\ndisplacement of an element of the medium is\n\nparallel to the direction of propagation of the\n\nwave. In Eq. (15.2), the displacement function\n\nfor a longitudinal wave is written as,\n\ns(x, t) = a sin (kx – ωt + φ) (15.9)\n\nwhere s(x, t ) is the displacement of an element\nof the medium in the direction of propagation\nof the wave at position x and time t. In Eq. (15.9),\na\n\n \nis the displacement amplitude; other\n\nquantities have the same meaning as in case\nof a transverse wave except that the\ndisplacement function y (x, t ) is to be replaced\nby the function s (x, t ).\n\n* Here again, ‘radian’ could be dropped and the units could be written merely as m–1. Thus, k represents 2π\ntimes the number of waves (or the total phase difference) that can be accommodated per unit length, with SI\n\nunits m–1.\n\nFig. 15.7 An element of a string at a fixed location\n\noscillates in time with amplitude a and\n\nperiod T, as the wave passes over it.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nWAVES 373\n\nuuuuu Example 15.2  A wave travelling along a\nstring is described by,\n\ny(x, t) = 0.005 sin (80.0 x – 3.0 t),\n\nin which the numerical constants are in\nSI units (0.005 m, 80.0 rad m–1, and\n3.0 rad s–1). Calculate (a) the amplitude,\n(b) the wavelength, and (c) the period and\nfrequency of the wave. Also, calculate the\ndisplacement y of the wave at a distance\nx = 30.0 cm and time t = 20 s ?\n\nAnswer  On comparing this displacement\nequation with Eq. (15.2),\n\ny (x, t ) = a sin (kx –  ωt ),\nwe find\n(a) the amplitude of the wave is 0.005 m = 5 mm.\n(b) the angular wave number k and angular\n\nfrequency ω are\nk = 80.0  m–1 and ω = 3.0 s–1\n\nWe, then, relate the wavelength λ to k through\nEq. (15.6),\n\nλ = 2π/k\n\n   1\n80.0 m\n\n2π\n−\n\n=\n\n=  7.85 cm\n\n(c) Now, we relate T to ω by the relation\n\nT = 2π/ω\n\n                   1\n3.0 s\n\n2π\n−\n\n=\n\n                    = 2.09 s\n\nand frequency, v  = 1/T = 0.48 Hz\n\nThe displacement y at x = 30.0 cm and\ntime t = 20 s is given by\n\ny  = (0.005 m) sin (80.0 × 0.3 – 3.0 × 20)\n\n            = (0.005 m) sin (–36 + 12π)\n = (0.005 m) sin (1.699)\n\n            = (0.005 m) sin (970) j 5 mm   t\n\n15.4   THE SPEED OF A TRAVELLING WAVE\n\nTo determine the speed of propagation of a\ntravelling wave, we can fix our attention on any\nparticular point on the wave (characterised by\nsome value of the phase) and see how that point\nmoves in time. It is convenient to look at the\n\nmotion of the crest of the wave. Fig. 15.8 gives\nthe shape of the wave at two instants of time,\nwhich differ by a small time internal ∆t. The\nentire wave pattern is seen to shift to the right\n(positive direction of x-axis) by a distance ∆x. In\nparticular, the crest shown by a dot (• ) moves a\n\ndistance ∆x in time ∆t. The speed of the wave is\nthen ∆x/∆t. We can put the dot (• ) on a point\nwith any other phase. It will move with the same\nspeed v (otherwise the wave pattern will not\nremain fixed). The motion of a fixed phase point\non the wave is given by\n\nkx – ωt = constant (15.10)\n\nThus, as time t changes, the position x of the\nfixed phase point must change so that the phase\nremains constant. Thus,\n\nkx – ωt = k(x+∆x) – ω(t+∆t)\n\nor k ∆x – ω ∆t =0\n\nTaking ∆x, ∆t vanishingly small, this gives\n\nω \n= =\n\nd\n\n dx\nv\n\nt k\n(15.11)\n\nRelating ω to T and k to λ, we get\n\n2\n\n2 /\n\nπν λ\nλν\n\nπ λ\n= = =v\n\nT\n(15.12)\n\nEq. (15.12), a general relation for all\nprogressive waves, shows that in the time\nrequired for one full oscillation by any\nconstituent of the medium, the wave pattern\ntravels a distance equal to the wavelength of the\nwave. It should be noted that the speed of a\nmechanical wave is determined by the inertial\n(linear mass density for strings, mass density\n\nFig. 15.8 Progression of a harmonic wave from time\n\nt  to t + ∆t. where ∆t is a small interval.\nThe wave pattern as a whole shifts to the\n\nright.

The medium\ndetermines the speed; Eq. (15.12) then relates\nwavelength to frequency for the given speed. Of\ncourse, as remarked earlier, the medium can\nsupport both transverse and longitudinal waves,\nwhich will have different speeds in the same\nmedium. Later in this chapter, we shall obtain\nspecific expressions for the speed of mechanical\nwaves in some media.\n\n15.4.1 Speed of a Transverse Wave on\nStretched String\n\nThe speed of a mechanical wave is determined\nby the restoring force setup in the medium when\nit is disturbed and the inertial properties (mass\ndensity) of the medium. The speed is expected to\nbe directly related to the former and inversely to\nthe latter. For waves on a string, the restoring\nforce is provided by the tension T in the string.\nThe inertial property will in this case be linear\nmass density µ, which is mass m  of the string\ndivided by its length L. Using Newton’s Laws of\nMotion, an exact formula for the wave speed on\na string can be derived, but this derivation is\noutside the scope of this book. We shall,\ntherefore, use dimensional analysis. We already\nknow that dimensional analysis alone can never\nyield the exact formula. The overall\ndimensionless constant is always left\nundetermined by dimensional analysis.\n\nThe dimension of µ is [ML–1] and that of T is\nlike force, namely [MLT–2]. We need to combine\nthese dimensions to get the dimension of speed\nv [LT–1]. Simple inspection shows that the\nquantity T/µ has the relevant dimension\n\nMLT\n\nML\nL T\n\n−\n\n−\n−\n\n\uf8ee\uf8f0 \uf8f9\uf8fb\n\uf8ee\uf8f0 \uf8f9\uf8fb\n\n= \uf8ee\uf8f0 \uf8f9\uf8fb\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2 2\n\nThus if T and µ are assumed to be the only\nrelevant physical quantities,\n\nv  = C \nT\n\nµ\n(15.13)\n\nwhere C is the undetermined constant of\ndimensional analysis. In the exact formula, it\nturms out, C=1. The speed of transverse waves\non a stretched string is given by\n\nv  = \nµ\nT\n\n  \n(15.14)\n\nNote the important point that the speed v\ndepends only on the properties of the medium T\nand µ (T is a property of the stretched string\narising due to an external force). It does not\ndepend on wavelength or frequency of the wave\nitself. In higher studies, you will come across\nwaves whose speed is not independent of\nfrequency of the wave. Of the two parameters λ\nand ν the source of disturbance determines the\nfrequency of the wave generated. Given the\n\nPropagation of a pulse on a rope\nYou can easily see the motion of a pulse on a rope. You can also see\nits reflection from a rigid boundary and measure its velocity of travel.\nYou will need a rope of diameter 1 to 3 cm, two hooks and some\nweights. You can perform this experiment in your classroom or\nlaboratory.\n\nTake a long rope or thick string of diameter 1 to 3 cm, and tie it to\nhooks on opposite walls in a hall or laboratory. Let one end pass on\na hook and hang some weight (about 1 to 5 kg) to it. The walls may\nbe about 3 to 5 m apart.\n\nTake a stick or a rod and strike the rope hard at a point near one\nend. This creates a pulse on the rope which now travels on it. You\ncan see it reaching the end and reflecting back from it. You can\ncheck the phase relation between the incident pulse and reflected\npulse. You can easily watch two or three reflections before the pulse\ndies out. You can take a stopwatch and find the time for the pulse\nto travel the distance between the walls, and thus measure its\n\nvelocity. Compare it with that obtained from Eq. (15.14).\nThis is also what happens with a thin metallic string of a musical instrument. The major difference is\n\nthat the velocity on a string is fairly high because of low mass per unit length, as compared to that on a\nthick rope. The low velocity on a rope allows us to watch the motion and  make measurements beautifully.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nWAVES 375\n\nspeed of the wave in the medium and the\nfrequency Eq.

We have\nalready seen that the sound waves travel in the\nform of compressions and rarefactions of small\nvolume elements of air.  The elastic property that\ndetermines the stress under compressional\nstrain is the bulk modulus of the medium defined\nby (see Chapter 9)\n\nP\nB  \n\nV/V\n\n∆\n= −\n\n∆\n(15.16)\n\nHere, the change in pressure ∆P produces a\n\nvolumetric strain \nV\n\nV\n\n∆\n. B has the same dimension\n\nas pressure and given in SI units in terms of\npascal (Pa). The inertial property relevant for the\npropagation of wave is the mass density ρ, with\ndimensions [ML–3]. Simple inspection reveals\nthat quantity B/ρ has the relevant dimension:\n\n(15.17)\n\nThus, if B and ρ  are considered to be the only\nrelevant physical quantities,\n\nv  = C \nB\n\nρ\n(15.18)\n\nwhere, as before, C is the undetermined constant\nfrom dimensional analysis. The exact derivation\nshows that C=1. Thus, the general formula for\nlongitudinal waves in a medium is:\n\nv  = \nB\n\nρ\n(15.19)\n\nFor a linear medium, like a solid bar, the\nlateral expansion of the bar is negligible and we\nmay consider it to be only under longitudinal\nstrain. In that case, the relevant modulus of\nelasticity is Young’s modulus, which has the\nsame dimension as the Bulk modulus.\nDimensional analysis for this case is the same\nas before and yields a relation like Eq. (15.18),\nwith an undetermined C, which the exact\nderivation shows to be unity. Thus, the speed of\nlongitudinal waves in a solid bar is given by\n\n v  = \nρ\nY\n\n(15.20)\n\nwhere Y is the Young’s modulus of the material\nof the bar. Table 15.1 gives the speed of sound\nin some media.\n\nTable 15.1 Speed of Sound in some Media\n\n   Liquids and solids generally have higher speed\nof sound than gases. [Note for solids, the speed\nbeing referred to is the speed of longitudinal\nwaves in the solid]. This happens because they\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS376\n\nare much more difficult to compress than gases\nand so have much higher values of bulk modulus.\nNow, see Eq. (15.19). Solids and liquids have\n\nhigher mass densities ( ρ ) than gases. But the\ncorresponding increase in both the modulus (B)\nof solids and liquids is much higher. This is the\nreason why the sound waves travel faster in\nsolids and liquids.\n\nWe can estimate the speed of sound in a gas\nin the ideal gas approximation. For an ideal gas,\nthe pressure P, volume V and temperature T are\nrelated by (see Chapter 11).\n\nPV = Nk\nB\nT (15.21)\n\nwhere N is the number of molecules in volume\nV, k\n\nB\n is the Boltzmann constant and T the\n\ntemperature of the gas (in Kelvin). Therefore, for\nan isothermal change it follows from Eq.(15.21)\nthat\n\nV∆P + P∆V  = 0\n\nor P\nV/V\n\nP\n =\n\n∆\n∆\n\n−\n\nHence, substituting in Eq. (15.16), we have\n\nB = P\n\nTherefore, from Eq. (15.19) the speed of a\nlongitudinal wave in an ideal gas is given by,\n\nv  = \nρ\nP\n\n(15.22)\n\nThis relation was first given by Newton and\nis known as Newton’s formula.\n\nuuuuu Example 15.4  Estimate the speed of\nsound in air at standard temperature and\npressure.

Therefore, density\nof air at STP is:\n ρ\n\no\n = (mass of one mole of air)/ (volume of one\n\nmole of air at STP)\n3\n\n3 3\n\n29.0 10 kg\n\n22.4 10 m\n \n\n−\n\n−\n\n×\n=\n\n×\n\n=  1.29 kg  m–3\n\nAccording to Newton’s formula for the speed\nof sound in a medium, we get for the speed of\nsound in air at STP,\n\n = 280 m s–1   (15.23)\n\nt\n\nThe result shown in Eq.(15.23) is about 15%\nsmaller as compared to the experimental value\nof 331 m s–1 as given in Table 15.1. Where\ndid we go wrong ? If we examine the basic\nassumption made by Newton that the pressure\nvariations in a medium during propagation of\nsound are isothermal, we find that this is not\ncorrect. It was pointed out by Laplace that the\npressure variations in the propagation of sound\nwaves are so fast that there is little time for the\nheat flow to maintain constant temperature.\nThese variations, therefore, are adiabatic and\nnot isothermal. For adiabatic processes the ideal\ngas satisfies the relation (see Section 12.8),\n\nPV\nγ\n  = constant\n\ni.e. ∆(PV γ )  = 0\nor P γ V γ –1 ∆V + V γ ∆P = 0\nwhere γ is the ratio of two specific heats,\nC\n\np\n/C\n\nv\n.\n\nThus, for an ideal gas the adiabatic bulk\nmodulus is given by,\n\nB\nad\n\n = \nV/V\n\nP\n \n∆\n\n∆\n−\n\n  =  γP\n   The speed of sound is, therefore, from Eq.\n(15.19), given by,\n\nv = \nρ\n\nγ P \n(15.24)\n\nThis modification of Newton’s formula is referred\nto as the Laplace correction. For air\nγ = 7/5. Now using Eq. (15.24) to estimate the speed\nof sound in air at STP, we get a value 331.3 m s–1,\nwhich agrees with the measured speed.\n\n15.5 THE PRINCIPLE OF SUPERPOSITION\nOF WAVES\n\nWhat happens when two wave pulses travelling\n\nin opposite directions cross each other\n\n(Fig. 15.9)? It turns out that wave pulses\n\ncontinue to retain their identities after they have\n\ncrossed. However, during the time they overlap,\n\nthe wave pattern is different from either of the\n\npulses. Figure 15.9 shows the situation when\n\ntwo pulses of equal and opposite shapes move\n\ntowards each other. When the pulses overlap,\n\nthe resultant displacement is the algebraic sum\n\nof the displacement due to each pulse. This is\n\nknown as the principle of superposition of waves.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nWAVES 377\n\nAccording to this principle, each pulse moves\nas if others are not present. The constituents of\nthe medium, therefore, suffer displacments due\nto both and since the displacements can be\npositive and negative, the net displacement is\nan algebraic sum of the two. Fig. 15.9 gives\ngraphs of the wave shape at different times. Note\nthe dramatic effect in the graph (c); the\ndisplacements due to the two pulses have exactly\ncancelled each other and there is zero\ndisplacement throughout.\n    To put the principle of superposition\nmathematically, let y\n\n1\n (x,t) and y\n\n2\n (x,t) be the\n\ndisplacements due to two wave disturbances in\nthe medium. If the waves arrive in a region\nsimultaneously, and therefore, overlap, the net\ndisplacement y (x,t) is given by\n\ny     (x, t ) =  y\n1\n(x, t ) +  y\n\n2\n(x, t ) (15.25)\n\nIf we have two or more waves moving in the\nmedium the resultant waveform is the sum of\nwave functions of individual waves. That is, if\nthe wave functions of the moving waves are\n\ny\n1\n = f\n\n1\n(x–vt),\n\ny\n2\n = f\n\n2\n(x–vt),\n\n..........\n\n           ..........\n\n           y\nn\n = f\n\nn\n (x–vt)\n\nthen the wave funct ion descr ib ing the\ndisturbance in the medium is\n\ny = f\n1\n(x – vt)+ f\n\n2\n(x – vt)+  ...+ f\n\nn\n(x – vt)\n\n   ( )\n=1i\n\nn\n f  x vt\n\ni\n= −∑ (15.26)\n\nThe principle of superposition is basic to the\nphenomenon of interference.\n\nFor simplicity, consider two harmonic\ntravelling waves on a stretched string, both with\nthe same ω (angular frequency) and k (wave\nnumber), and, therefore, the same wavelength\nλ. Their wave speed will be identical. Let us\nfurther assume that their amplitudes are equal\nand they are both travelling in the positive\ndirection of x-axis. The waves only differ in their\ninitial phase. According to Eq. (15.2), the two\nwaves are described by the functions:\n\ny\n1\n(x, t) = a sin (kx – ωt) (15.27)\n\nand y\n2\n(x, t) =  a sin (kx – ωt + φ ) (15.28)\n\nThe net displacement is then, by the principle\nof superposition, given by\n\ny  (x, t ) = a sin (kx – ωt) + a sin (kx – ωt + φ )\n(15.29)\n\n( ) ( )\n2sin cos\n\n2 2\n\nkx t kx t\na\n\nω ω φ φ\uf8ee \uf8f9− + − +\uf8ee \uf8f9\n= \uf8ef \uf8fa\uf8ef \uf8fa\n\n\uf8ef \uf8fa\uf8f0 \uf8fb\uf8f0 \uf8fb\n(15.30)\n\nwhere we have used the familiar trignometric\n\nidentity for sin sinA B+ .

(15.31) is also a harmonic travelling wave in\nthe positive direction of x-axis, with the same\nfrequency and wavelength. However, its initial\n\nphase angle is \n2\n\nφ\n. The significant thing is that\n\nits amplitude is a function of the phase difference\nφ between the constituent two waves:\n\nA(φ)  =  2a cos ½φ (15.32)\nFor φ = 0, when the waves are in phase,\n\n( ) ( ), 2 siny x t a kx tω= − (15.33)\ni.e., the resultant wave has amplitude 2a, the\n\nlargest possible value for A.

The overlapping pulses add up\n\nto zero displacement in curve (c).\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS378\n\nreflected. The phenomenon of echo is an example\nof reflection by a rigid boundary. If the boundary\nis not completely rigid or is an interface between\ntwo different elastic media, the situation is some\nwhat complicated. A part of the incident wave is\nreflected and a part is transmitted into the\nsecond medium. If a wave is incident obliquely\non the boundary between two different media\nthe transmitted wave is called the refracted\nwave. The incident and refracted waves obey\nSnell’s law of refraction, and the incident and\nreflected waves obey the usual laws of\nreflection.\n\nFig. 15.11 shows a pulse travelling along a\nstretched string and being reflected by the\nboundary. Assuming there is no absorption of\nenergy by the boundary, the reflected wave has\nthe same shape as the incident pulse but it\nsuffers a phase change of π or 1800 on reflection.\nThis is because the boundary is rigid and the\ndisturbance must have zero displacement at all\ntimes at the boundary. By the principle of\nsuperposition, this is possible only if the reflected\nand incident waves differ by a phase of π, so that\nthe resultant displacement is zero. This\nreasoning is based on boundary condition on a\nrigid wall. We can arrive at the same conclusion\ndynamically also. As the pulse arrives at the wall,\nit exerts a force on the wall. By Newton’s Third\nLaw, the wall exerts an equal and opposite force\non the string generating a reflected pulse that\ndiffers by a phase of π.\n\nFig. 15.11 Reflection of a pulse meeting a rigid boundary.\n\nFig. 15.10 The resultant of two harmonic waves of\nequal amplitude and wavelength\n\naccording to the principle of superposition.\n\nThe amplitude of the resultant wave\n\ndepends on the phase difference φ, which\nis zero  for (a) and π for (b)\n\nwaves are completely, out of phase and the\nresultant wave has zero displacement\neverywhere at all times\n\ny   (x, t )  = 0 (15.34)\nEq.

(15.34)\nis the case of destructive\nintereference where the\namplitudes subtract out in the\nresultant wave. Fig. 15.10\nshows these two cases of\ninterference of waves arising\nfrom the principle of\nsuperposition.\n\n15.6 REFLECTION OF\nWAVES\n\nSo far we considered waves\npropagating in an unbounded\nmedium. What happens if a\npulse or a wave meets a\nboundary? If the boundary is\nrigid, the pulse or wave gets\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nWAVES 379\n\nIf on the other hand, the boundary point is\nnot rigid but completely free to move (such as in\nthe case of a string tied to a freely moving ring\non a rod), the reflected pulse has the same phase\nand amplitude (assuming no energy dissipation)\nas the incident pulse. The net maximum\ndisplacement at the boundary is then twice the\namplitude of each pulse. An example of non- rigid\nboundary is the open end of an organ pipe.\n\nTo summarise, a travelling wave or pulse\nsuffers a phase change of π on reflection at a\nrigid boundary and no phase change on\nreflection at an open boundary. To put this\nmathematically, let the incident travelling wave\nbe\n\n( ) ( )2 , sin ω= −y x t a kx t\nAt a rigid boundary, the reflected wave is given\nby\n\ny\nr\n(x, t) = a sin (kx – ωt + π).\n\n   = – a sin (kx – ωt ) (15.35)\nAt an open boundary, the reflected wave is given\nby\n\ny\nr\n(x, t ) = a sin (kx – ωt + 0).\n\n   = a sin (kx – ωt ) (15.36)\n\nClearly, at the rigid boundary, \n2\n\n0= + =\nr\n\ny y y\n\nat all times.\n\n15.6.1   Standing Waves and Normal Modes\n\nWe considered above reflection at one boundary.\nBut there are familiar situations (a string fixed\nat either end or an air column in a pipe with\neither end closed) in which reflection takes place\nat two or more boundaries. In a string, for\nexample, a wave travelling in one direction will\nget reflected at one end, which in turn will travel\nand get reflected from the other end. This will\ngo on until there is a steady wave pattern set\nup on the string. Such wave patterns are called\nstanding waves or stationary waves. To see this\nmathematically, consider a wave travelling\nalong the positive direction of x-axis and a\nreflected wave of the same amplitude and\nwavelength in the negative direction of x-axis.\nFrom Eqs. (15.2) and (15.4), with φ = 0, we get:\n\ny\n1\n(x, t ) = a sin (kx – ωt )\n\ny\n2\n(x, t ) = a sin (kx + ωt )\n\nThe resultant wave on the string is, according\nto the principle of superposition:\n\ny (x, t) =  y\n1\n(x, t ) + y\n\n2\n(x, t )\n\n= a [sin (kx – ωt) + sin (kx + ωt)]\n\nUsing the familiar trignometric identity\nSin (A+B) + Sin (A–B) = 2 sin A cosB we get,\n\ny (x, t ) = 2a sin kx cos ωt (15.37)\n\nNote the important difference in the wave\npattern described by Eq. (15.37) from that\ndescribed by Eq. (15.2) or Eq. (15.4). The terms\nkx and ωt appear separately, not in the\ncombination kx - ωt. The amplitude of this wave\nis 2a sin kx. Thus, in this wave pattern, the\namplitude varies from point-to-point, but each\nelement of the string oscillates with the same\nangular frequency ω or time period. There is no\nphase difference between oscillations of different\nelements of the wave. The string as a whole\nvibrates in phase with differing amplitudes at\ndifferent points. The wave pattern is neither\nmoving to the right nor to the left. Hence, they\nare called standing or stationary waves. The\namplitude is fixed at a given location but, as\nremarked earlier, it is different at different\nlocations. The points at which the amplitude is\nzero (i.e., where there is no motion at all) are\nnodes; the points at which the amplitude is the\nlargest are called antinodes. Fig. 15.12 shows\na stationary wave pattern resulting from\nsuperposition of two travelling waves in\nopposite directions.\n\nThe most significant feature of stationary\nwaves is that the boundary conditions constrain\nthe possible wavelengths or frequencies of\nvibration of the system. The system cannot\noscillate with any arbitrary frequency (contrast\nthis with a harmonic travelling wave), but is\ncharacterised by a set of natural frequencies or\nnormal modes of oscillation. Let us determine\nthese normal modes for a stretched string fixed\nat both ends.\n\nFirst, from Eq. (15.37), the positions of nodes\n(where the amplitude is zero) are given by\nsin kx = 0 .\nwhich implies\n\nkx = nπ;   n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nSince, k = 2π/λ , we get\n\nx = \nλ\n\n2\n\nn\n ; n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...        (15.38)\n\nClearly, the distance between any two\n\nsuccessive nodes is \nλ\n2\n\n. \nIn the same way, the\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS380\n\npositions of antinodes (where the amplitude is\nthe largest) are given by the largest value of sin\nkx :\n\n\uf8efsin kx\n \n\uf8ef= 1\n\nwhich implies\n\nkx = (n + ½) π ; n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nWith k = 2π/λ, we get\n\n x = (n + ½)\n2\n\nλ\n ; n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...                (15.39)\n\nAgain the distance between any two consecutive\n\nantinodes is \n2\n\nλ\n. Eq. (15.38) can be applied to\n\nthe case of a stretched string of length L fixed\nat both ends. Taking one end to be at x = 0, the\nboundary conditions are that x = 0 and x = L\nare positions of nodes. The x = 0 condition is\nalready satisfied. The x = L node condition\nrequires that the length L is related to λ by\n\nL = n \n2\n\nλ\n;     n = 1, 2, 3, ...      (15.40)\n\nThus, the possible wavelengths of stationary\nwaves are constrained by the relation\n\nλ  = 2L\n\nn\n;    n = 1, 2, 3, … (15.41)\n\nwith corresponding frequencies\n\nv =  \n2L\n\nnv\n, for  n = 1, 2, 3, (15.42)\n\nWe have thus obtained the natural frequencies\n- the normal modes of oscillation of the system.\nThe lowest possible natural frequency of a\nsystem is called its fundamental mode or the\nfirst harmonic. For the stretched string fixed\n\nat either end it is given by v = \nv\n\nL2\n, corresponding\n\nto n = 1 of Eq. (15.42). Here v is the speed of\nwave determined by the properties of the\nmedium. The n = 2 frequency is called the\nsecond harmonic; n = 3 is the third harmonic\n\nFig. 15.12 Stationary waves arising from superposition of two harmonic waves travelling in opposite directions.\nNote that the positions of zero displacement (nodes) remain fixed at all times.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nWAVES 381\n\nand so on. We can label the various\nharmonics by the symbol ν\n\nn\n ( n = 1,\n\n2, ...).\n\nFig. 15.13 shows the first six\n\nharmonics of a stretched string\n\nfixed at either end. A string need not\nvibrate in one of these modes only.\n\nGenerally, the vibration of a string\n\nwill be a superposition of different\n\nmodes; some modes may be more\n\nstrongly excited and some less.\n\nMusical instruments like sitar or\nviolin are based on this principle.\n\nWhere the string is plucked or\n\nbowed, determines which modes are\n\nmore prominent than others.\n\nLet us next consider normal\n\nmodes of oscillation of an air column\nwith one end closed and the other\n\nopen. A glass tube partially filled\n\nwith water illustrates this system.\n\nThe end in contact with water is a\n\nnode, while the open end is an\n\nantinode. At the node the pressure\nchanges are the largest, while the\n\ndisplacement is minimum (zero). At\n\nthe open end - the antinode, it is\n\njust the other way - least pressure\n\nchange and maximum amplitude of\n\ndisplacement. Taking the end in\ncontact with water to be x = 0, the\n\nnode condition (Eq. 15.38) is already\n\nsatisfied. If the other end x = L is an\n\nantinode, Eq. (15.39) gives\n\nL =   n +\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n1\n\n2\n \n2\n\nλ\n, for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, …\n\nThe possible wavelengths are then restricted by\nthe relation :\n\nλ  = \n( )\n\n2\n\n1 2\n\nL\n\nn  + /\n,  for n = 0, 1, 2, 3,...

For a pipe open at both ends, each end is\nan antinode. It is then easily seen that an open\nair column at both ends generates all harmonics\n(See Fig. 15.15).\n\nThe systems above, strings and air columns,\ncan also undergo forced oscillations (Chapter\n14). If the external frequency is close to one of\nthe natural frequencies, the system shows\nresonance.\n\nFig. 15.13  The first six harmonics of vibrations of a stretched\nstring fixed at both ends.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS382\n\nNormal modes of a circular membrane rigidly\nclamped to the circumference as in a tabla are\ndetermined by the boundary condition that no\npoint on the circumference of the membrane\nvibrates. Estimation of the frequencies of normal\nmodes of this system is more complex. This\nproblem involves wave propagation in two\ndimensions. However, the underlying physics is\nthe same.\n\nuuuuu Example 15.5  A pipe, 30.0 cm long, is\nopen at both ends. Which harmonic mode\nof the pipe resonates a 1.1 kHz source?  Will\nresonance with the same source be\nobserved if one end of the pipe is closed ?\nTake the speed of sound in air as\n330 m s–1.\n\nAnswer  The first harmonic frequency is given\nby\n\n                ν\n1\n = \n\nL\n\nvv\n\n2\n  \n\n1\n=\n\nλ\n     (open pipe)\n\nwhere L is the length of the pipe. The frequency\nof its nth harmonic is:\n\nν\nn\n = \n\nL\n\nnv\n\n2\n, for n = 1, 2, 3, ... (open pipe)\n\nFirst few modes of an open pipe are shown in\nFig. 15.15.\n\nFor L = 30.0 cm, v = 330 m s–1,\n\nν\nn\n = \n\n1\n 330 (m s )\n\n0.6  (m)\n\n−\nn\n\n = 550 n s–1\n\nClearly, a source of frequency 1.1 kHz will\nresonate at v\n\n2\n, i.e. the second harmonic.\n\nNow if one end of the pipe is closed (Fig. 15.15),\nit follows from Eq. (14.50) that the fundamental\nfrequency is\n\nν\n1\n =  \n\nL\n\nvv\n\n4\n  \n\n1\n=\n\nλ  (pipe closed at one end)\n\nand only the odd numbered harmonics are\npresent :\n\nν\n3\n = \n\n3\n\n4\n\nv\n\nL\n,  ν\n\n5\n = \n\n5\n\n4\n\nv\n\nL\n, and so on.\n\nFor L = 30 cm and v = 330 m s–1, the\nfundamental frequency of the pipe closed at one\nend is 275 Hz and the source frequency\ncorresponds to its fourth harmonic. Since this\nharmonic is not a possible mode, no resonance\nwill be observed with the source, the moment\none end is closed. t\n\n15.7   BEATS\n\n‘Beats’ is an interesting phenomenon arising\nfrom interference of waves.

Artists use this phenomenon often\nwhile tuning their instruments with each other.\nThey go on tuning until their sensitive ears do\nnot detect any beats.\n\nTo see this mathematically, let us consider\ntwo harmonic sound waves of nearly equal\nangular frequency ω\n\n1\n and ω\n\n2\n and fix the location\n\nto be x = 0 for convenience. Eq. (15.2) with a\nsuitable choice of phase (φ = π/2 for each) and,\nassuming equal amplitudes, gives\n s\n\n1\n = a \n\n \ncos ω\n\n1\nt   and  s\n\n2\n = a \n\n \ncos ω\n\n2\nt         (15.45)\n\nHere we have replaced the symbol y by s,\nsince we are referring to longitudinal not\ntransverse displacement. Let ω\n\n1\n be the (slightly)\n\ngreater of the two frequencies. The resultant\ndisplacement is, by the principle of\nsuperposition,\n\ns =  s\n1\n + s\n\n2\n = a (cos\n\n \nω\n\n1 \nt + cos ω\n\n2 \nt)\n\nUsing the familiar trignometric identity for\ncos A + cosB, we get\n\n( ) ( )1 2 1 2\n 2 cos  cos\n\n2 2\n\nt t\na\n\nω ω ω ω  − +\n= (15.46)\n\nwhich may be written as :\ns = [2 a  cos ω\n\nb \nt ] cos ω\n\na\nt (15.47)\n\nIf |ω\n1 \n– ω\n\n2\n| <<ω\n\n1\n, ω\n\n2\n, ω\n\na\n >> ω\n\nb\n, th\n\nwhere\n\nω\nb\n = ( )1 2\n\n2\n\nω ω −\n and  ω\n\na\n = ( )1 2\n\n2\n\nω ω +\n\nNow if we assume |ω\n1 \n– ω\n\n2\n| <<ω\n\n1\n, which means\n\nω\na\n >> ω\n\nb\n, we can interpret Eq.

The amplitude is the largest when the\nterm cos ω\n\nb \nt takes its limit +1 or –1.

At the\nNellaiappar temple\nin Tamil Nadu,\ngentle taps on a\n\ncluster of pillars carved out of a single piece\nof rock produce the basic notes of Indian\nclassical music, viz. Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha,\nNi, Sa. Vibrations of these pillars depend on\nelasticity of the stone used, its density and\nshape.\n\nMusical pillars are categorised into three\ntypes: The first is called the Shruti Pillar,\nas it can produce the basic notes —  the\n“swaras”. The second type is the Gana\nThoongal, which generates the basic tunes\nthat make up the “ragas”. The third variety\nis the Laya Thoongal pillars that produce\n“taal” (beats) when tapped. The pillars at the\nNellaiappar temple are a combination of the\nShruti and Laya types.\n\nArchaeologists date the Nelliappar\ntemple to the 7th century and claim it was\nbuilt by successive rulers of the Pandyan\ndynasty.\n\nThe musical pillars of Nelliappar and\nseveral other temples in southern India like\nthose at Hampi (picture), Kanyakumari, and\nThiruvananthapuram are unique to the\ncountry and have no parallel in any other\npart of the world.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS384\n\ndecreases as it recedes away. When we\napproach a stationary source of sound with high\nspeed, the pitch of the sound heard appears to\nbe higher than that of the source. As the\nobserver recedes away from the source, the\nobserved pitch (or frequency) becomes lower\nthan that of the source. This motion-related\nfrequency change is called Doppler effect. The\nAustrian physicist Johann Christian Doppler\nfirst proposed the effect in 1842. Buys Ballot in\nHolland tested it experimentally in 1845.\nDoppler effect is a wave phenomenon, it holds\nnot only for sound waves but also for\nelectromagnetic waves. However, here we shall\nconsider only sound waves.\n\nWe shall analyse changes in frequency under\nthree different situations: (1) observer is\n\nReflection of sound in an open\npipe\n\nWhen a high\npressure pulse of\nair travelling down\nan open pipe\nreaches the other\nend, its momentum\ndrags the air out\ninto the open, where\npressure falls\nrapidly to the\na t m o s p h e r i c\npressure. As a\n\nresult the air following after it in the tube is\npushed out. The low pressure at the end of\nthe tube draws air from further up the tube.\nThe air gets drawn towards the open end\nforcing the low pressure region to move\nupwards. As a result a pulse of high pressure\nair travelling down the tube turns into a\npulse of low pressure air travelling up the\ntube. We say a pressure wave has been\nreflected at the open end with a change in\nphase of 1800. Standing waves in an open\npipe organ like the flute is a result of this\nphenomenon.\n\nCompare this with what happens when\na pulse of high pressure air arrives at a\nclosed end: it collides and as a result pushes\nthe air back in the opposite direction. Here,\nwe say that the pressure wave is reflected,\nwith no change in phase.\n\nFig. 15.16 Superposition of two harmonic waves, one\nof frequency 11 Hz (a), and the other of\n\nfrequency 9Hz (b), giving rise to beats of\n\nfrequency 2 Hz, as shown in (c).\n\nω\n2\n.

The amplitude of the resultant wave\n\nshows beats at a frequency of 2 Hz.\n\nuuuuu Example 15.6  Two sitar strings A and B\nplaying the note ‘Dha’ are slightly out of\ntune and produce beats of frequency 5 Hz.\nThe tension of the string B is slightly\nincreased and the beat frequency is found\nto decrease to 3 Hz. What is the original\nfrequency of B if the frequency of A is\n427 Hz ?\n\nAnswer Increase in the tension of a string\nincreases its frequency. If the original frequency\nof B (ν\n\nB\n) were greater than that of A (ν\n\nA \n), further\n\nincrease in ν\nB\n should have resulted in an\n\nincrease in the beat frequency. But the beat\nfrequency is found to decrease. This shows that\nν\n\nB\n < ν\n\nA\n. Since ν\n\nA\n – ν\n\nB\n = 5 Hz, and ν\n\nA\n = 427 Hz, we\n\nget ν\nB\n = 422 Hz.       t\n\n15.8    DOPPLER EFFECT\n\nIt is an everyday experience that the pitch (or\nfrequency) of the whistle of a fast moving train\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nWAVES 385\n\nstationary but the source is moving, (2) observer\nis moving but the source is stationary, and (3)\nboth the observer and the source are moving.\nThe situations (1) and (2) differ from each other\nbecause of the absence or presence of relative\nmotion between the observer and the medium.\nMost waves require a medium for their\npropagation; however, electromagnetic waves do\nnot require any medium for propagation. If there\nis no medium present, the Doppler shifts are\nsame irrespective of whether the source moves\nor the observer moves, since there is no way of\ndistinction between the two situations.\n\n15.8.1    Source Moving ; Observer Stationary\n\nLet us choose the convention to take the\ndirection from the observer to the source as\nthe positive direction of velocity. Consider a\nsource S moving with velocity vs and an observer\nwho is stationary in a frame in which the\nmedium is also at rest. Let the speed of a wave\nof angular frequency ω and period To, both\nmeasured by an observer at rest with respect to\nthe medium, be v. We assume that the observer\nhas a detector that counts every time a wave\ncrest reaches it. As shown in\nFig. 15.17, at time t = 0 the source is at point S1,\nlocated at a distance L from the observer,  and\nemits a crest.  This reaches the observer at time\nt1 = L/v. At time t = To the source has moved a\ndistance vsTo and is at point S2, located at a\ndistance (L + vsTo) from the observer. At S2, the\nsource emits a second crest.

He measures a higher\nfrequency when the source approaches him.\n\n15.8.2 Observer Moving; Source\nStationary\n\nNow to derive the Doppler shift when the\nobserver is moving with velocity vo towards the\nsource and the source is at rest, we have to\nproceed in a different manner. We work in the\n\nFig. 15.17 Doppler effect (change in frequency of\nwave) detected when the source is moving\n\nand the observer is at rest in the medium.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS386\n\nreference frame of the moving observer.

(15.53) and the approximate relation\nEq. (15.51 ) are the same.\n\n15.8.3  Both Source and Observer Moving\n\nWe will now derive a general expression for\nDoppler shift when both the source and the\nobserver are moving. As before, let us take the\ndirection from the observer to the source as the\npositive direction. Let the source and the\nobserver be moving with velocities vs and vo\nrespectively as shown in Fig.15.18. Suppose at\ntime t = 0, the observer is at O1 and the source\nis at S1, O1 being to the left of S1. The source\nemits a wave of velocity v, of frequency v and\nperiod T0 all measured by an observer at rest\n\nwith respect to the medium. Let L be the\n\ndistance between O1 and S1 at t = 0, when the\n\nsource emits the first crest. Now, since the\n\nobserver is moving, the velocity of the wave\n\nrelative to the observer is v +v0.\n \nTherefore, the\n\nfirst crest reaches the observer at time t1 = L/\n\n(v+v0 ). At time t = T0, both the observer and the\n\nsource have moved to their new positions O2 and\n\nS2 respectively. The new distance between the\n\nobserver and the source, O2 S2, would be\n\nL+(vs–v0 ) T0]. At S2, the source emits a\n\nsecond crest.\n\nApplication of Doppler effect\n\nThe change in frequency caused by a moving object\ndue to Doppler effect is used to measure their\nvelocities in diverse areas such as military,\nmedical science, astrophysics, etc. It is also used\nby police to check over-speeding of vehicles.\n\nA sound wave or electromagnetic wave of\nknown frequency is sent towards a moving object.\nSome part of the wave is reflected from the object\nand its frequency is detected by the monitoring\nstation. This change in frequency is called Doppler\nshift.\n\nIt is used at airports to guide aircraft, and in\nthe military to detect enemy aircraft.\nAstrophysicists use it to measure the velocities\nof stars.\n\nDoctors use it to study heart beats and blood\nflow in different parts of the body. Here they use\nulltrasonic waves, and in common practice, it is\ncalled sonography. Ultrasonic waves enter the\nbody of the person, some of them are reflected\nback, and give information about motion of blood\nand pulsation of heart valves, as well as pulsation\nof the heart of the foetus. In the case of heart,\nthe picture generated is called echocardiogram.\n\nFig. 15.18 Doppler effect when both the source and\nobserver are moving with different\n\nvelocities.\n\nThis reaches the observer at time.\n\nt2 = To + [L + (vs – vo)To )] /(v + vo)\n\nAt time nTo the source emits its (n+1) th crest\nand this reaches the observer at time\n\ntn+1 = nTo + [L + n (vs – vo)To)] /(v + vo )\n\nHence, in a time interval tn+1 –t1, i.e.,\n\nnTo + [L + n (vs – vo)To)] /(v + vo ) – L /(v + vo ),\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nWAVES 387\n\nthe observer counts n crests and the observer\nrecords the period of the wave as equal to T given by\n\n0 0\n\n0 0\n\n-\n  1\n\n  \ns o sv v v vT T T\n\nv v v v\n\n\uf8eb \uf8f6 \uf8eb \uf8f6+\n= + =\uf8ec \uf8f7 \uf8ec \uf8f7\n\n+ +\uf8ed \uf8f8 \uf8ed \uf8f8\n(15.54)\n\nThe frequency v observed by the observer is\ngiven by\n\n(15.55)\n\nConsider a passenger sitting in a train moving\non a straight track. Suppose she hears a whistle\nsounded by the driver of the train.  What\nfrequency will she measure or hear? Here both\nthe observer and the source are moving with\nthe same velocity, so there will be no shift in\nfrequency and the passenger will note the\nnatural frequency. But an observer outside who\nis stationary with respect to the track will note\na higher frequency if the train is approaching\nhim and a lower frequency when it recedes\nfrom him.\n\nNote that we have defined the direction from\nthe observer to the source as the positive\ndirection. Therefore, if the observer is moving\ntowards the source, v0 has a positive (numerical)\nvalue whereas if O is moving away from S, v0\nhas a negative value. On the other hand, if S is\nmoving away from O, vs has a positive value\nwhereas if it is moving towards O, vs has a\nnegative value. The sound emitted by the source\ntravels in all directions. It is that part of sound\ncoming towards the observer which the  observer\nreceives and detects. Therefore, the relative\nvelocity of sound with respect to the observer is\nv + v\n\n0\n in all cases.\n\nuuuuu Example 15.7  A rocket is moving at a\nspeed of 200 m s–1 towards a stationary\ntarget. While moving, it emits a wave of\nfrequency 1000 Hz. Some of the sound\nreaching the target gets reflected back to the\nrocket as an echo. Calculate (1) the\nfrequency of the sound as detected by the\ntarget and (2) the frequency of the echo as\ndetected by the rocket.\n\nAnswer (1) The observer is at rest and the\nsource is moving with a speed of 200 m s–1. Since\nthis is comparable with the velocity of sound,\n330 m s–1, we must use Eq. (15.50) and not the\napproximate Eq. (15.51). Since the source is\napproaching a stationary target, v\n\no\n = 0, and v\n\ns\n\nmust be replaced by –v\ns\n.\n \nThus, we have\n\n1\n\n1\n\n−\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n\uf8eb\n−=\n\nv\ns\n\nv\n  0vv\n\n v = 1000 Hz × [1 – 200 m s–1/330 m s–1]–1\n\n     j  2540 Hz\n\n(2) The target is now the source (because it is\nthe source of echo) and the rocket’s detector is\nnow the detector or observer (because it detects\necho). Thus, v\n\ns\n = 0 and v\n\no\n has a positive value.\n\nThe frequency of the sound emitted by the source\n(the target) is v, the frequency intercepted by\nthe target and not v\n\no\n.

Mechanical waves can exist in material media and are governed by Newton’s Laws.\n\n2. Transverse waves are waves in which the particles of the medium oscillate perpendicular\nto the direction of wave propagation.\n\n3. Longitudinal waves are waves in which the particles of the medium oscillate along the\ndirection of wave propagation.\n\n4. Progressive wave is a wave that moves from one point of medium to another.\n\n5. The displacement in a sinusoidal wave propagating in the positive x direction is given\nby\n\ny (x, t) = a sin (kx – ωt + φ)\nwhere a is the amplitude of the wave, k is the angular wave number, ω is the angular\nfrequency, (kx – ωt + φ) is the phase, and φ is the phase constant or phase angle.\n\n6. Wavelength λ of a progressive wave is the distance between two consecutive points of\nthe same phase at a given time. In a stationary wave, it is twice the distance between\ntwo  consecutive nodes or antinodes.\n\n7. Period T of oscillation of a wave is defined as the time any element of the medium\ntakes to move through one complete oscillation. It is related to the angular frequency ω\nthrough the relation\n\nT =\n2π\n\nω\n\n8. Frequency v of a wave is defined as 1/T and is related to angular frequency by\n\n2\n\nω\nν =\n\nπ\n\n9. Speed of a progressive wave is given by \nk T\n\nv\nω λ\n\nλν= = =\n\n10.  The speed of a transverse wave on a stretched string is set by the properties of the\nstring. The speed on a string with tension T and linear mass density µ is\n\nv =\nT\n\nµ\n\n11. Sound waves are longitudinal mechanical waves that can travel through solids, liquids,\nor gases. The speed v of sound wave in a fluid having bulk modulus B and density ρ is\n\nv\nB\n\n=\nρ\n\nThe speed of longitudinal waves in a metallic bar is\n\nv\nY\n\n=\nρ\n\nFor  gases,  since B = γP, the speed of sound is\n\nv\nP\n\n=\nγ\n\nρ\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nWAVES 389\n\n12. When two or more waves traverse simultaneously in the same medium, the\ndisplacement of any element of the medium is the algebraic sum of the displacements\ndue to each wave. This is known as the principle of superposition of waves\n\n1\n\n(   )\nn\n\ni\n\ni\n\ny f x vt\n=\n\n= −∑\n\n13. Two sinusoidal waves on the same string exhibit interference, adding or cancelling\naccording to the principle of superposition. If the two are travelling in the same\ndirection and have the same amplitude a and frequency but differ in phase by a phase\nconstant φ, the result is a single wave with the same frequency ω :\n\ny     (x, t)  = 2\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\na kxcos sinφ ω φ\n\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\uf8ef\n\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb\uf8fa\n\n− +\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n t \n\nIf φ = 0 or an integral multiple of 2π, the waves are exactly in phase and the interference\nis constructive; if φ = π, they are exactly out of phase and the interference is destructive.\n\n14. A travelling wave, at a rigid boundary or a closed end, is reflected with a phase reversal\nbut the reflection at an open boundary takes place without any phase change.\n\nFor an incident wave\n\n                           y\ni \n(x, t) = a sin (kx – ωt )\n\nthe reflected wave at a rigid boundary is\n\n                         y\nr \n(x, t) = – a sin (kx + ωt )\n\nFor reflection at an open boundary\n\n                       y\nr \n(x,t ) = a sin (kx + ωt)\n\n15. The interference of two identical waves moving in opposite directions produces standing\nwaves. For a string with fixed ends, the standing wave is given by\n\ny (x, t) = [2a sin kx ] cos ωt\n\nStanding waves are characterised by fixed locations of zero displacement called nodes\nand fixed locations of maximum displacements called antinodes. The separation between\ntwo consecutive nodes or antinodes is λ/2.\nA stretched string of length L fixed at both the ends vibrates with frequencies given by\n\nv  ,\n2\n\n=\nn v\n\nL\n     n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nThe set of frequencies given by the above relation are called the normal modes of\noscillation of the system. The oscillation mode with lowest frequency is called the\nfundamental mode or the first harmonic. The second harmonic is the oscillation mode\nwith n = 2 and so on.\n\nA pipe of length L with one end closed and other end open (such as air columns)\nvibrates with frequencies given by\n\nv ( )n ½  \n2L\n\nv\n= + ,       n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nThe set of frequencies represented by the above relation are the normal modes of\noscillation of such a system. The lowest frequency given by v/4L is the fundamental\nmode or the first harmonic.\n\n16. A string of length L fixed at both ends or an air column closed at one end and open at\nthe other end or open at both the ends, vibrates with certain frequencies called their\nnormal modes. Each of these frequencies is a resonant frequency of the system.\n\n17. Beats arise when two waves having slightly different frequencies, ν\n1\n and ν\n\n2\n and\n\ncomparable amplitudes, are superposed. The beat frequency is\n\nν\nbeat\n\n = ν\n1\n ~ ν\n\n2\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS390\n\n18. The Doppler effect is a change in the observed frequency of a wave when the source (S)\nor  the observer (O) or both move(s) relative to the medium. For sound the observed\nfrequency ν is given in terms of the source frequency ν\n\no\n by\n\nv = v\no\n \n\n0\n\n \ns\n\nv v\n\nv v\n\n\uf8eb \uf8f6+\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ec \uf8f7+\n\uf8ed \uf8f8\n\nhere v is the speed of sound through the medium, v\no\n is the velocity of observer relative\n\nto the medium, and v\ns\n is the source velocity relative to the medium. In using this\n\nformula, velocities in the direction OS should be treated as positive and those opposite\nto it should be taken to be negative.\n\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n\n1. A wave is not motion of matter as a whole in a medium.  A wind is different from the\nsound wave in air.  The former involves motion of air from one place to the other.  The\nlatter involves compressions and rarefactions of layers of air.\n\n2. In a wave, energy and not the matter is transferred from one point to the other.\n\n3. In a mechanical wave, energy transfer takes place because of the coupling through\nelastic forces between neighbouring oscillating parts of the medium.\n\n4. Transverse waves can propagate only in medium with shear modulus of elasticity,\nLongitudinal waves need bulk modulus of elasticity and are therefore, possible in all\nmedia, solids, liquids and gases.\n\n5. In a harmonic progressive wave of a given frequency, all particles have the same\namplitude but different phases at a given instant of time.  In a stationary wave, all\nparticles between two nodes have the same phase at a given instant but have different\namplitudes.\n\n6. Relative to an observer at rest in a medium the speed of a mechanical wave in that\nmedium (v) depends only on elastic and other properties (such as mass density) of\nthe medium. It does not depend on the velocity of the source.\n\n7. For an observer moving with velocity v\no\n relative to the medium, the speed of a wave is\n\nobviously different from v and is given by v ± v\no\n.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nWAVES 391\n\nEXERCISES\n\n15.1 A string of mass 2.50 kg is under a tension of 200 N.
