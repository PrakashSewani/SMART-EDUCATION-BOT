Boyle,\nNewton and several others tried to explain the behaviour of\ngases by considering that gases are made up of tiny atomic\nparticles. The actual atomic theory got established more than\n150 years later. Kinetic theory explains the behaviour of gases\nbased on the idea that the gas  consists of rapidly moving\natoms or molecules. This is possible as the inter-atomic forces,\nwhich are short range forces that are important for solids\nand liquids,  can be neglected for gases. The kinetic theory\nwas developed in the nineteenth century by Maxwell,\nBoltzmann and others. It has been remarkably successful. It\ngives a molecular interpretation of  pressure and temperature\nof a gas, and is consistent with gas laws and Avogadro’s\nhypothesis. It correctly explains specific heat capacities of\nmany gases. It also relates measurable properties of gases\nsuch as viscosity, conduction and diffusion with molecular\nparameters, yielding estimates of molecular sizes and masses.\nThis chapter gives an introduction to kinetic theory.\n\n13.2 MOLECULAR NATURE OF MATTER\n\nRichard Feynman, one of the great physicists of 20th century\nconsiders the discovery that “Matter is made up of atoms” to\nbe a very significant one. Humanity may suffer annihilation\n(due to nuclear catastrophe) or extinction (due to\nenvironmental disasters) if we do not act wisely. If that\nhappens, and all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed\nthen Feynman would like the ‘Atomic Hypothesis’ to be\ncommunicated to the next generation of creatures in the\nuniverse. Atomic Hypothesis: All things are made of atoms -\nlittle particles that move around in perpetual motion,\nattracting each other when they are a little distance apart,\nbut repelling upon being squeezed into one another.\n\nSpeculation that matter may not be continuous, existed in\nmany places and cultures.

The scientific ‘Atomic\nTheory’  is usually credited to John Dalton. He\nproposed the atomic  theory to explain the laws\nof definite and multiple proportions obeyed by\nelements when they combine into compounds.\nThe first law says that any given compound has,\na fixed proportion by mass of its constituents.\nThe second law says that when two elements\nform more than one compound, for a fixed mass\nof one element, the masses of the other elements\nare in ratio of small integers.\n\nTo explain the laws Dalton suggested, about\n200 years ago,  that the smallest constituents\nof an element are atoms. Atoms of one element\nare identical but differ from those of other\nelements.  A small number of atoms of each\nelement combine to form a molecule of the\ncompound. Gay Lussac’s law, also given in early\n19th century, states:  When gases combine\nchemically to yield another gas, their volumes\nare in the ratios of small integers.  Avogadro’s\nlaw  (or hypothesis) says: Equal volumes of all\ngases at equal temperature and pressure have\nthe same number of molecules.  Avogadro’s law,\nwhen combined with Dalton’s theory explains\nGay  Lussac’s law.  Since the elements are often\nin the form of molecules, Dalton’s atomic theory\ncan also be referred to as the molecular theory\n\nof matter. The theory is now well accepted by\nscientists. However even at the end of the\nnineteenth century there were famous scientists\nwho did not believe in atomic theory !\n\nFrom many observations, in recent times we\nnow know that  molecules (made up of one or\nmore atoms) constitute matter. Electron\nmicroscopes  and scanning tunnelling\nmicroscopes enable us to even see them. The\nsize of an atom is about an angstrom (10 -10   m).\nIn solids, which are tightly packed, atoms are\nspaced about a few  angstroms (2 Å) apart. In\nliquids the separation between atoms is also\nabout the same.  In liquids the atoms  are not\nas rigidly fixed as in solids, and can move\naround. This enables a liquid to flow.  In gases\nthe interatomic distances are in tens of\nangstroms.  The average distance a molecule\ncan travel without colliding is called the  mean\nfree path. The mean free path, in gases, is of\nthe order of thousands of angstroms. The atoms\nare much freer in gases and can travel long\ndistances without colliding. If they are not\nenclosed, gases disperse away. In solids and\nliquids the closeness makes the interatomic force\nimportant. The force has a long range attraction\nand a short range repulsion. The atoms attract\nwhen they are at a few angstroms but repel when\nthey come closer. The static appearance of a gas\n\nAtomic Hypothesis in Ancient India and Greece\n\nThough John Dalton is credited with the introduction of atomic viewpoint in modern science, scholars in\nancient India and Greece conjectured long before the existence of atoms and molecules.  In the Vaiseshika\nschool of thought in India founded by Kanada (Sixth century B.C.) the atomic picture was developed in\nconsiderable detail. Atoms were thought to be eternal, indivisible, infinitesimal and ultimate parts of matter.\nIt was argued that if matter could be subdivided without an end, there would be no difference between a\nmustard seed and the Meru mountain.  The four kinds of atoms (Paramanu — Sanskrit word for the\nsmallest particle) postulated were Bhoomi (Earth), Ap (water), Tejas (fire) and Vayu (air) that have characteristic\nmass and other attributes, were propounded. Akasa (space) was thought to have no atomic structure and\nwas continuous and inert. Atoms combine to form different molecules (e.g. two atoms combine to form a\ndiatomic molecule dvyanuka, three atoms form a tryanuka or a triatomic molecule), their properties depending\nupon the nature and ratio of the constituent atoms.  The size of the atoms was also estimated, by conjecture\nor by methods that are not known to us.  The estimates vary. In Lalitavistara, a famous biography of the\nBuddha written mainly in the second century B.C., the estimate is close to the modern estimate of atomic\nsize, of the order of 10 –10 m.\n   In ancient Greece, Democritus (Fourth century B.C.) is best known for his atomic hypothesis. The\nword ‘atom’ means ‘indivisible’ in Greek. According to him, atoms differ from each other physically, in\nshape, size and other properties and this resulted in the different properties of the substances formed\nby their combination.  The atoms of water were smooth and round and unable to ‘hook’ on to each\nother, which is why liquid /water flows easily.   The atoms of earth were rough and jagged, so they held\ntogether to form hard substances.  The atoms of fire were thorny which is why it caused painful burns.\nThese fascinating ideas, despite their ingenuity, could not evolve much further, perhaps because they\nwere intuitive conjectures and speculations not tested and modified by quantitative experiments - the\nhallmark of modern science.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nKINETIC THEORY 325\n\nis misleading. The gas is full of activity and the\nequilibrium is a dynamic one. In dynamic\nequilibrium, molecules collide and change their\nspeeds during the collision. Only the average\nproperties are constant.\n\nAtomic theory is not the end of our quest, but\nthe beginning. We now know that atoms are not\nindivisible or elementary. They consist of a\nnucleus and electrons. The nucleus itself is made\nup of protons and neutrons. The protons and\nneutrons are again made up of quarks. Even\nquarks may not be the end of the story. There\nmay be string like elementary entities. Nature\nalways has surprises for us, but the search for\ntruth is often enjoyable and the discoveries\nbeautiful. In this chapter, we shall limit ourselves\nto understanding the behaviour of gases (and a\nlittle bit of solids), as a collection of moving\nmolecules in incessant motion.\n\n13.3   BEHAVIOUR OF GASES\n\nProperties of gases are easier to understand than\nthose of solids and liquids. This is mainly\nbecause in a gas, molecules are far from each\nother and their mutual interactions are\nnegligible except when two molecules collide.\nGases at low pressures and high temperatures\nmuch above that at which they liquefy (or\nsolidify) approximately satisfy a simple relation\nbetween their pressure, temperature and volume\ngiven by (see Chapter 11)\n\nPV = KT (13.1)\n\nfor a given sample of the gas. Here T is the\ntemperature in kelvin or (absolute)  scale. K is  a\nconstant for the given sample but varies with\nthe volume of the gas. If we now  bring in  the\nidea of atoms or molecules, then K is proportional\nto the number of molecules, (say) N in the\nsample. We can write K = N k . Observation tells\nus that this k is same for all gases. It is called\nBoltzmann constant and is denoted by k\n\nB\n.\n\nAs 1 1 2 2\n1 1 2 2\n\nP V P V\n\nN T N T\n=  = constant = k\n\nB\n(13.2)\n\nif P, V and T are same, then N is also same for\nall gases. This is Avogadro’s hypothesis, that  the\nnumber of molecules per unit volume is\nthe same for all gases at a fixed temperature and\npressure. The number in 22.4 litres of any gas\nis 6.02 × 1023.  This is known as Avogadro\nnumber  and is denoted by N\n\nA\n. The mass of 22.4\n\nlitres of any gas is equal to its molecular weight\nin grams at S.T.P (standard temperature 273 K\nand pressure 1 atm). This amount of substance\nis called a mole (see Chapter 2 for a more precise\ndefinition). Avogadro had guessed the equality of\nnumbers in equal volumes of gas at a fixed\ntemperature and pressure from chemical\nreactions.  Kinetic  theory justifies this hypothesis.\n\nThe perfect gas equation can be written as\n\nPV = µ RT (13.3)\nwhere  µ   is the number of moles and R  = N\n\nA\nk\n\nB\n is a universal constant. The temperature T is\n\nabsolute temperature.  Choosing kelvin scale for\n\nJohn Dalton (1766 – 1844)\n\nHe was an English chemist. When different types of atoms combine,\nthey obey certain simple laws. Dalton’s atomic theory explains these\nlaws in a simple way. He also gave a theory of colour\nblindness.\n\nAmedeo Avogadro (1776 – 1856)\n\nHe made a brilliant guess that equal volumes of gases\nhave equal number of molecules at the same\ntemperature and pressure. This helped in\nunderstanding the combination of different gases in\n\na very simple way. It is now called Avogadro’s hypothesis (or law). He also\nsuggested that the smallest constituent of gases like hydrogen, oxygen and\nnitrogen are not atoms but diatomic molecules.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n326 PHYSICS\n\nabsolute temperature, R = 8.314 J mol–1K–1.\nHere\n\n0 A\n\nM N\n\nM N\nµ = = (13.4)\n\nwhere M is the mass of the gas containing N\nmolecules, M\n\n0\n is the molar mass and N\n\nA\n the\n\nAvogadro’s number. Using  Eqs. (13.4) and (13.3)\ncan also be written as\n\nPV = k\nB\n NT or P = k\n\nB\n nT\n\nP (atm)\nFig.13.1 Real gases approach ideal gas behaviour\n\nat low pressures and high temperatures.\n\nwhere  n is the number density, i.e. number of\nmolecules per unit volume. k\n\nB\n is  the Boltzmann\n\nconstant introduced above. Its value in SI units\nis 1.38 × 10–23 J K–1.\n\nAnother useful form of Eq. (13.3) is\n\n0\n\nRT\nP\n\nM\n\nρ\n= (13.5)\n\nwhere ρ is the mass density of the gas.\nA gas that satisfies Eq. (13.3) exactly at all\n\npressures and temperatures is defined to be an\nideal gas. An ideal gas is a simple theoretical\nmodel of a gas. No real gas is truly ideal.\nFig. 13.1 shows departures from ideal gas\nbehaviour for a real gas at three different\ntemperatures. Notice that all curves approach\nthe ideal gas behaviour for low  pressures and\nhigh temperatures.\n\nAt low pressures or high temperatures the\nmolecules are far apart and molecular\ninteractions are negligible. Without interactions\nthe gas behaves like an ideal one.\n\nIf we fix µ and T in Eq. (13.3), we get\n\nPV = constant (13.6)\n\ni.e., keeping temperature constant, pressure of\na given mass of gas varies inversely with volume.\nThis is the famous Boyle’s law. Fig. 13.2  shows\ncomparison between experimental P-V curves\nand the theoretical curves predicted by Boyle’s\nlaw. Once again you see that the  agreement is\ngood at high temperatures and  low pressures.\nNext, if you fix P, Eq. (13.1) shows that V ∝  T\ni.e., for a fixed pressure, the volume of a gas is\nproportional to its absolute temperature T\n(Charles’ law). See Fig. 13.3.\n\nFig.13.2 Experimental P-V curves (solid lines) for\nsteam at three temperatures compared\n\nwith Boyle’s law (dotted lines). P is in units\n\nof 22 atm and V in units of 0.09 litres.\n\nFinally, consider a mixture of non-interacting\nideal  gases: µ\n\n1\n  moles of gas 1, µ\n\n2\n moles of gas\n\n2, etc. in a vessel of volume V at temperature T\nand  pressure P. It is then found that the\nequation  of state of the mixture is :\n\nPV = ( µ\n1\n + µ\n\n2 \n+…  ) RT (13.7)\n\ni.e. 1 2 ...\nRT RT\n\nP\nV V\n\nµ µ= + + (13.8)\n\n= P\n1\n + P\n\n2\n + … (13.9)\n\nClearly P\n1\n =    µ\n\n1\n R T/V   is the pressure that\n\ngas 1 would  exert at the same conditions of\nvolume and  temperature if no other gases were\npresent. This is called the partial pressure of the\ngas. Thus, the total pressure of a mixture of ideal\ngases is the sum of partial pressures. This is\nDalton’s law of partial pressures.\n\n(\n)\n\n–1\n–1\n\nJ\nm\n\no\nl\n\nK\np\nV Tµ\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nKINETIC THEORY 327\n\nt\n\nt\n\nt\n\nFig. 13.3 Experimental T-V curves (solid lines) for\nCO\n\n2\n at three pressures compared with\n\nCharles’ law (dotted lines). T is in units of\n\n300 K and V in units of 0.13 litres.\n\nWe next consider some examples which give\nus information about the volume occupied by\nthe molecules and the volume of a single\nmolecule.\n\nExample 13.1 The density of water is  1000\nkg m–3. The density of water vapour at 100 °C\nand 1 atm pressure is 0.6 kg m–3. The\nvolume of a molecule multiplied by the total\nnumber gives ,what is called, molecular\nvolume. Estimate the ratio (or fraction) of\nthe molecular volume  to the total volume\noccupied by the water vapour under the\nabove conditions of temperature and\npressure.\n\nAnswer For  a given mass of water molecules,\nthe density is less if volume is large. So the\nvolume of the vapour is  1000/0.6  = 1/(6 ×10 -4 )\ntimes larger.  If densities of bulk water and water\nmolecules are same, then the fraction of\nmolecular volume to the total volume in liquid\nstate is 1. As volume in vapour state has\nincreased, the fractional volume is less by the\nsame amount, i.e.  6×10-4.       t\n\nExample 13.2   Estimate the volume of a\nwater molecule using the data in Example\n13.1.\n\nAnswer In the liquid (or solid) phase, the\nmolecules of water are quite closely packed. The\n\ndensity of water molecule may therefore, be\nregarded as roughly equal to the density of bulk\nwater = 1000 kg m–3. To estimate the volume of\na water molecule, we need to know the mass of\na single water molecule. We know that 1 mole\nof water has a mass approximately equal to\n\n(2 + 16)g  = 18 g  =  0.018 kg.\nSince 1 mole   contains  about   6 × 1023\n\nmolecules   (Avogadro’s  number),   the mass of\na molecule of water is  (0.018)/(6 × 1023) kg  =\n3 × 10–26 kg.   Therefore, a rough estimate of the\nvolume of a water  molecule is as follows :\n\nVolume of a water molecule\n= (3 × 10–26 kg)/ (1000 kg m–3)\n= 3 × 10–29 m3\n\n= (4/3) π  (Radius)3\nHence, Radius ≈ 2 ×10-10  m = 2 Å   t\n\nExample 13.3   What is the average\ndistance between atoms   (interatomic\ndistance) in water? Use the data given in\nExamples 13.1 and 13.2.\n\nAnswer :   A given mass of water in vapour state\nhas 1.67×103 times the volume of the same mass\nof water in liquid state (Ex. 13.1). This is also\nthe increase in the amount of volume available\nfor each molecule of water. When volume\nincreases by 103 times the radius increases by\nV1/3 or 10 times, i.e., 10 × 2 Å  = 20 Å. So the\naverage distance is 2 × 20 = 40  Å.   t\n\nExample 13.4 A vessel contains two non-\nreactive gases : neon (monatomic) and\noxygen (diatomic). The ratio of their partial\npressures is 3:2. Estimate the ratio of  (i)\nnumber of molecules and (ii) mass density\nof neon and oxygen in the vessel. Atomic\nmass of Ne = 20.2 u, molecular mass of O\n\n2\n= 32.0 u.\n\nAnswer Partial pressure of a gas in a mixture is\nthe pressure it would have for the same volume\nand temperature if it alone occupied the vessel.\n(The total pressure of a mixture of non-reactive\ngases is the sum of partial pressures due to its\nconstituent gases.) Each gas (assumed ideal)\nobeys the gas law. Since V and T are common to\nthe two gases,  we  have  P\n\n1\nV = µ \n\n1\n RT and P\n\n2\nV =\n\nµ\n2\n RT, i.e. (P\n\n1\n/P\n\n2\n) = (µ\n\n1 \n/ µ\n\n2\n). Here 1 and 2 refer\n\nto neon and oxygen respectively. Since (P\n1\n/P\n\n2\n) =\n\n(3/2) (given), (µ\n1\n/ µ\n\n2\n) = 3/2.\n\nt\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n328 PHYSICS\n\n(i) By definition µ\n1\n = (N\n\n1\n/N\n\nA\n ) and µ\n\n2 \n= (N\n\n2\n/N\n\nA\n)\n\nwhere N\n1\n and N\n\n2\n are the number of molecules\n\nof 1 and 2, and N\nA\n is the Avogadro’s number.\n\nTherefore, (N\n1\n/N\n\n2\n) = (µ\n\n1 \n/ µ\n\n2\n)  = 3/2.\n\n(ii) We can also write µ\n1\n = (m\n\n1\n/M\n\n1\n) and µ\n\n2\n =\n\n(m\n2\n/M\n\n2\n) where m\n\n1 \nand m\n\n2\n are the masses of\n\n1 and 2; and M\n1\n and M\n\n2\n are their molecular\n\nmasses. (Both m\n1\n and M\n\n1\n; as well as m\n\n2\n and\n\nM\n2\n should be expressed in the same units).\n\nIf ρ\n1\n and ρ\n\n2 \n are the mass densities of 1 and\n\n2 respectively,  we have\n\nρ\n\nρ\n\nµ\n\nµ\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n= = = ×\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\nm V\n\nm V\n\nm\n\nm\n\nM\n\nM\n\n/\n/\n\n3 20.2\n0.947\n\n2 32.0\n= × =   t\n\n13.4 KINETIC THEORY OF AN IDEAL GAS\n\nKinetic theory of gases is based on the molecular\npicture of matter. A given amount of gas is a\ncollection of a large number of molecules\n(typically of the order of Avogadro’s number) that\nare in incessant random motion. At ordinary\npressure and temperature, the average distance\nbetween molecules is a factor of 10 or more than\nthe typical size of a molecule (2 Å). Thus,\ninteraction between molecules is negligible and\nwe can assume that they move freely in straight\nlines according to Newton’s first law. However,\noccasionally, they come close to each other,\nexperience intermolecular forces and their\nvelocities change.  These interactions are called\ncollisions. The molecules collide incessantly\nagainst each other or with the walls and change\ntheir velocities.  The collisions are considered to\nbe elastic. We can derive an expression for the\npressure of a gas based on the kinetic theory.\n\nWe begin with the idea that molecules of a\ngas are in incessant random motion, colliding\nagainst one another and with the walls of the\ncontainer. All collisions between molecules\namong themselves or between molecules and the\nwalls are elastic. This implies that  total kinetic\nenergy is conserved. The total momentum is\nconserved as usual.\n\n13.4.1 Pressure of an Ideal Gas\n\nConsider a gas enclosed in a cube of side l. Take\nthe axes to be parallel to the sides of the cube,\nas shown in Fig. 13.4.  A molecule with velocity\n\n(v\nx\n, v\n\ny\n, v\n\nz\n ) hits the planar wall parallel to yz-\n\nplane of area A (= l2). Since the collision is elastic,\nthe molecule rebounds with the same velocity;\nits y and z components of velocity do not change\nin the collision but the x-component reverses\nsign. That is, the velocity after collision is\n(-v\n\nx\n, v\n\ny\n, v\n\nz\n ) . The change in momentum of the\n\nmolecule is:  –mv\nx\n – (mv\n\nx\n) = – 2mv\n\nx \n. By the\n\nprinciple of conservation of momentum, the\nmomentum imparted to the wall in the collision\n= 2mv\n\nx\n .\n\nTo calculate the force (and pressure) on the\nwall, we need to calculate momentum imparted\nto the wall per unit time. In a small time interval\n∆t, a molecule with x-component of velocity v\n\nx\n\nwill hit the wall if it is within the distance v\nx\n ∆t\n\nfrom the wall. That is, all molecules within the\nvolume Av\n\nx \n∆t only can hit the wall in time ∆t.\n\nBut, on the average, half of these are moving\ntowards the wall and the other half away from\nthe wall. Thus, the number of molecules with\nvelocity (v\n\nx\n, v\n\ny\n, v\n\nz\n )  hitting the wall in time ∆t is\n\n½A v\nx  \n\n∆t n, where n is the number of molecules\nper unit volume. The total momentum\ntransferred to the wall by these molecules in\ntime ∆t  is :\n\nQ = (2mv\nx\n) (½ n A v\n\nx\n ∆t ) (13.10)\n\nThe force on the wall is the rate of momentum\ntransfer Q/∆t  and pressure is force per unit\narea :\n\nP =  Q /(A ∆t)  =  n m v\nx\n2 (3.11)\n\nActually, all molecules in a gas do not have\nthe same velocity; there is a distribution in\nvelocities.  The  above equation, therefore, stands\nfor pressure due to the group of molecules with\nspeed v\n\nx\n  in  the x-direction and n stands for the\n\nnumber density of that group of molecules. The\n\nFig. 13.4 Elastic collision of a gas molecule with\nthe wall of the container.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nKINETIC THEORY 329\n\ntotal  pressure is obtained by summing over the\ncontribution due to all groups:\n\nP = n m 2\nxv (13.12)\n\nwhere 2\nxv  is the average of  vx\n\n2  .  Now the gas\nis isotropic, i.e. there is no preferred direction\nof velocity of the molecules in the vessel.\nTherefore, by symmetry,\n\n2\nx\n\nv  = \n2\nyv  = \n\n2\nz\n\nv\n\n= (1/3) [ 2\nxv  +  \n\n2\nyv  + \n\n2\nzv ] = (1/3) \n\n2\nv (13.13)\n\nwhere v is the speed and 2v   denotes the mean\n\nof the squared speed. Thus\n\nP = (1/3) n m 2v (13.14)\n\nSome remarks on this derivation. First,\nthough we choose the container to be a cube,\nthe shape of the vessel really is immaterial. For\na vessel of arbitrary shape, we can always choose\na small infinitesimal (planar) area and carry\nthrough the steps above. Notice that both A and\n∆t do not appear in the final result. By Pascal’s\nlaw, given in Ch. 10,  pressure in one portion of\n\nthe gas  in equilibrium is the same as anywhere\nelse. Second, we have ignored any collisions in\nthe derivation. Though this assumption is\ndifficult to justify rigorously, we can qualitatively\nsee that it will not lead to erroneous results.\nThe number of molecules hitting the wall in time\n∆t was found to be ½ n Av\n\nx\n ∆t. Now the collisions\n\nare random and the gas is in a steady state.\nThus, if a molecule with velocity (v\n\nx\n, v\n\ny\n, v\n\nz\n )\n\nacquires a  different velocity due to collision with\nsome molecule, there will always be some other\nmolecule with a different initial velocity which\nafter a collision acquires the velocity  (v\n\nx\n, v\n\ny\n, v\n\nz\n ).\n\nIf this were not so, the distribution of velocities\nwould not remain steady. In any case we are\nfinding 2\n\nxv . Thus, on the whole, molecular\ncollisions (if they are not too frequent and the\ntime spent in a collision is negligible compared\nto time between collisions)  will not affect the\ncalculation above.\n\n13.4.2 Kinetic Interpretation of Temperature\n\nEquation (13.14) can be written as\nPV   =  (1/3) nV m 2v (13.15a)\n\nFounders of Kinetic Theory of Gases\n\nJames Clerk Maxwell (1831 – 1879), born in Edinburgh,\nScotland, was among the greatest physicists of the nineteenth\ncentury.  He derived the thermal velocity distribution of molecules\nin a gas and was among the first to obtain reliable estimates of\nmolecular parameters from measurable quantities like viscosity,\netc.  Maxwell’s greatest achievement was the unification of the laws\nof electricity and magnetism (discovered by Coulomb, Oersted,\nAmpere and Faraday) into a consistent set of equations now called\nMaxwell’s equations. From these he arrived at the most important\nconclusion that light is an\nelectromagnetic wave.\nInterestingly, Maxwell did not\nagree with the idea (strongly\nsuggested by the Faraday’s\nlaws of electrolysis) that\nelectricity was particulate in\nnature.\n\nLudwig Boltzmann\n(1844 – 1906) born in\n\nVienna, Austria, worked on the kinetic theory of gases\nindependently of Maxwell.  A firm advocate of atomism, that is\nbasic to kinetic theory, Boltzmann provided a statistical\ninterpretation of the Second Law of thermodynamics and the\nconcept of entropy. He is regarded as one of the founders of classical\nstatistical mechanics. The proportionality constant connecting\nenergy and temperature in kinetic theory is known as Boltzmann’s\nconstant in his honour.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n330 PHYSICS\n\nt\n\nPV   =   (2/3) N x ½ m 2v (13.15b)\nwhere N (= nV ) is the number of molecules in\nthe sample.\n\nThe quantity in the bracket is the average\ntranslational kinetic energy of the molecules in\nthe gas. Since the internal energy E of an ideal\ngas is purely kinetic*,\n\nE = N × (1/2) m 2v (13.16)\n\nEquation (13.15) then gives :\nPV = (2/3) E (13.17)\nWe are now ready for a kinetic interpretation\n\nof temperature. Combining Eq. (13.17) with the\nideal gas Eq. (13.3), we get\n\nE = (3/2)  k\nB  \n\nNT                                             (13.18)\nor  E/ N = ½  m 2v    =   (3/2) kBT (13.19)\ni.e., the average kinetic energy of a molecule is\nproportional to the absolute temperature of the\ngas; it is independent of pressure, volume or\nthe nature of the ideal gas. This is a fundamental\nresult relating temperature, a macroscopic\nmeasurable parameter of a gas\n(a thermodynamic variable as it is called) to a\nmolecular quantity, namely the average kinetic\nenergy of a molecule. The two domains are\nconnected by the Boltzmann constant. We note\nin passing that Eq. (13.18) tells us that internal\nenergy of an ideal gas depends only on\ntemperature, not on pressure or volume. With\nthis interpretation of temperature, kinetic theory\nof an ideal gas is completely consistent with the\nideal gas equation and the various gas laws\nbased on it.\n\nFor a mixture of non-reactive ideal gases, the\ntotal pressure gets contribution from each gas\nin the mixture. Equation (13.14) becomes\n\nP = (1/3) [n\n1\nm\n\n1\n2\n1v  + n2 m2 \n\n2\n2v +…  ] (13.20)\n\nIn equilibrium, the average kinetic energy of\nthe molecules of different gases will be equal.\nThat is,\n\n½  m\n1\n 2\n\n1v  = ½ m2 \n2\n2v = (3/2) kB T\n\nso that\nP = (n\n\n1\n + n\n\n2\n +…  ) k\n\nB\n T (13.21)\n\nwhich is Dalton’s law of partial pressures.\nFrom Eq. (13.19), we can get an idea of the\n\ntypical speed of molecules in a gas. At a\ntemperature T = 300 K, the mean square speed\nof a molecule in nitrogen gas is :\n\n2 –26\n26\n\n28\n4.65 10\n\n6.02 10\nN\n\nA\n\nM\nm\n\nN\n= = = ×\n\n×  kg.\n\n2\nv   =  3 kB T / m    =    (516)\n\n2 m2s-2\n\nThe square root of 2v  is known as root mean\nsquare (rms) speed and is denoted by v\n\nrms\n,\n\n( We can also write    2v     as   < v\n2 >.)\n\nv\nrms\n\n   =    516 m s-1\n\nThe speed is of the order of the speed of sound\nin air. It follows from Eq. (13.19) that at the same\ntemperature, lighter molecules have greater rms\nspeed.\n\nExample 13.5 A flask contains argon and\nchlorine in the ratio of 2:1 by mass.  The\ntemperature of the mixture is 27 °C. Obtain\nthe ratio of  (i) average kinetic energy per\nmolecule, and (ii) root mean square speed\nv\n\nrms\n of the molecules of the two gases.\n\nAtomic mass of argon = 39.9 u; Molecular\nmass of chlorine = 70.9 u.\n\nAnswer The important point to remember is that\nthe average kinetic energy (per molecule) of any\n(ideal) gas (be it monatomic like argon, diatomic\nlike chlorine or polyatomic) is always equal to\n(3/2) k\n\nB\nT. It depends only on temperature, and\n\nis independent of the nature of the gas.\n(i) Since argon and chlorine both have the same\n\ntemperature in the flask, the ratio of average\nkinetic energy (per molecule) of the two gases\nis 1:1.\n\n(ii) Now  ½ m v\nrms\n\n2  =  average kinetic energy per\nmolecule =  (3/2) ) k\n\nB\nT where m is the mass\n\nof a molecule of the gas.

Any other proportion by mass of\nargon and chlorine would give the same answers\nto (i) and (ii), provided the temperature remains\nunaltered. t\n\nExample 13.6   Uranium has two isotopes\nof masses 235 and 238 units. If both are\npresent in Uranium hexafluoride gas which\nwould have the  larger average speed ? If\natomic mass of fluorine is 19 units,\nestimate the percentage difference in\nspeeds at any temperature.\n\nAnswer  At a fixed temperature the average\nenergy  = ½ m <v2 > is constant. So  smaller the\n\nmass of the molecule, faster will be the speed.\nThe ratio of speeds is inversely proportional to\nthe square root of the ratio of the masses. The\nmasses are 349 and 352 units. So\n\nv\n349\n\n / v\n352\n\n  =   ( 352/ 349)1/2 = 1.0044 .\n\nHence difference \nV\n\nV\n\n∆\n= 0.44 %.\n\n[235U\n \nis the isotope needed for nuclear fission.\n\nTo separate it from the more abundant isotope\n238U,  the mixture  is surrounded by a  porous\ncylinder. The porous cylinder must be thick and\nnarrow, so that the molecule wanders through\nindividually, colliding with the walls of the long\npore. The faster molecule will leak out more than\n\nMaxwell Distribution Function\n\nIn a given mass of gas, the velocities of all molecules are not the same, even when bulk\nparameters like pressure, volume and temperature are fixed. Collisions change the direction\nand the speed of molecules. However in a state of equilibrium, the distribution of speeds is\nconstant or fixed.\n\nDistributions are very important and useful when dealing with systems containing large\nnumber of  objects. As an example consider the ages of different persons in a city. It is not\nfeasible to deal with the age of each individual. We can divide the people into groups: children\nup to age 20 years, adults between ages of 20 and 60, old people above 60. If we want more\ndetailed information we can choose smaller intervals, 0-1, 1-2,..., 99-100 of age groups. When\nthe size of the interval becomes smaller, say half year, the number of persons in the interval\nwill also reduce, roughly half the original number in the one  year interval. The number of\npersons  dN(x)  in the age interval x and x+dx is proportional to dx or dN(x)  =   n\n\nx\n  dx.  We have\n\nused n\nx\n to denote the number of persons at the value of x.\n\nMaxwell distribution of molecular speeds\n\nIn a similar way the molecular speed distribution gives the number of molecules between\nthe speeds v and v+ dv. dN(v)\n\n \n= 4p N a3e–bv\n\n2 v2 dv = n\nv\ndv.  This is called Maxwell distribution.\n\nThe plot of n\nv \n against v is shown in the figure. The fraction of the molecules with speeds v and\n\nv+dv is equal to the area of the strip shown. The average of any quantity like v2 is defined by\nthe integral <v2> = (1/N ) ∫ v2 dN(v)\n\n   \n= ªªªªª(3kB T/m)    which  agrees with the result derived from\n\nmore elementary considerations.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n332 PHYSICS\n\nt\n\nthe slower one and so there is more of the lighter\nmolecule (enrichment) outside the porous\ncylinder (Fig. 13.5). The method is not very\nefficient and has to be repeated several times\nfor sufficient enrichment.]. t\n\nWhen gases diffuse, their rate of diffusion is\ninversely proportional to square root of the\nmasses (see Exercise 13.12 ). Can you guess the\nexplanation from the above answer?\n\nFig. 13.5  Molecules going through a porous wall.\n\nExample 13.7  (a)  When a molecule (or\nan elastic ball) hits a ( massive) wall, it\nrebounds with the same speed. When a ball\nhits a massive bat held firmly, the same\nthing happens. However, when the bat is\nmoving towards the ball, the ball rebounds\nwith a different speed. Does the ball move\nfaster or slower? (Ch.6 will refresh your\nmemory on elastic collisions.)\n\n(b) When gas in a cylinder is compressed\nby pushing in a piston, its temperature\nrises. Guess at an explanation of this in\nterms of kinetic theory using (a) above.\n\n(c) What happens when a compressed gas\npushes a piston out and expands. What\nwould you observe ?\n(d) Sachin Tendulkar used a heavy cricket\nbat while playing. Did it help him in\nanyway ?\n\nAnswer  (a)  Let the speed of the ball be u  relative\nto the wicket behind the bat. If the bat is moving\ntowards the ball with a speed V  relative to the\nwicket, then the relative speed of the ball to bat\n\nis V + u  towards the bat. When the ball rebounds\n(after hitting the massive bat) its speed,  relative\nto bat,  is V + u  moving away from the bat. So\nrelative to the wicket the speed of the rebounding\nball is V + (V + u) = 2V + u, moving away from\nthe wicket. So the ball speeds up after the\ncollision with the bat. The rebound speed will\nbe less than u if the bat is not massive. For a\nmolecule this would imply an increase in\ntemperature.\n\nYou  should be able to answer (b) (c) and (d)\nbased on the answer to (a).\n(Hint: Note the correspondence, pistonà bat,\n\ncylinder à wicket, molecule à ball.)         t\n\n13.5  LAW OF EQUIPARTITION OF ENERGY\n\nThe kinetic energy of a single molecule is\n\n2 2 21 1 1      \n2 2 2t x y z\n\nmv mv mvε = + + (13.22)\n\nFor a gas in thermal equilibrium at\ntemperature T  the average value of energy\n\ndenoted by   < tε > is\n\n2 2 21 1 1 3\n2 2 2 2\n\nt x y z Bmv mv mv k Tε = + + = (13.23)\n\nSince there is no preferred direction, Eq.

If it is\nconstrained to move in a plane it needs two; and\nif constrained to move along a line, it needs just\none coordinate to locate it. This can also be\nexpressed in another way. We say that it has\none degree of freedom for motion in a line, two\nfor motion in a plane and three for motion in\nspace. Motion of a body as a whole from one\npoint to another is called translation. Thus, a\nmolecule free to move in space has three\ntranslational degrees of freedom. Each\ntranslational degree of freedom contributes a\nterm that contains square of some variable of\nmotion, e.g., ½ mv\n\nx\n2  and similar terms in\n\nv\ny\n and v\n\nz\n. In, Eq. (13.24) we see that in thermal\n\nequilibrium, the average of each such term is\n½ k\n\nB\nT .\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nKINETIC THEORY 333\n\nMolecules of a monatomic gas like argon have\nonly translational degrees of freedom. But what\nabout a diatomic gas such as O\n\n2\n or N\n\n2\n? A\n\nmolecule of O\n2 \nhas three translational degrees\n\nof freedom. But in addition it can also rotate\nabout its centre of mass. Figure 13.6 shows the\ntwo independent axes of rotation 1 and 2, normal\nto the axis joining the two oxygen atoms about\nwhich the molecule can rotate*. The molecule\nthus has two rotational degrees of freedom, each\nof which contributes a term to the total energy\nconsisting of translational energy tε  and\nrotational energy ε\n\nr\n.\n\n2 2 2 2 2\n1 1 2 2\n\n1 1 1 1 1\n2 2 2 2 2t r x y z\n\nmv mv mv I Iε ε ω ω+ = + + + + (13.25)\n\nFig. 13.6 The two independent axes of rotation of a\n\ndiatomic molecule\n\nwhere ω\n1 \nand ω\n\n2 \n are the angular speeds about\n\nthe axes 1 and 2 and I\n1\n, I\n\n2 \nare the corresponding\n\nmoments of inertia. Note that each rotational\ndegree of freedom contributes a term to the\nenergy that contains square of a rotational\nvariable of motion.\n\nWe have assumed above that the O\n2\n molecule\n\nis a ‘rigid rotator’, i.e., the molecule does not\nvibrate. This assumption, though found to be\ntrue (at moderate temperatures) for O\n\n2\n, is not\n\nalways valid. Molecules, like CO, even at\nmoderate temperatures have a mode of vibration,\ni.e., its atoms oscillate along the interatomic axis\nlike a one-dimensional oscillator, and contribute\na vibrational energy term ε\n\nv\n to the total energy:\n\nεv m\ny\n\nt\nky=\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n+\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n2\n2d\n\nd\n\nt r vε ε ε= + + ε (13.26)\nwhere k is the force constant of the oscillator\nand y the vibrational co-ordinate.\n\nOnce again the vibrational energy terms in\nEq. (13.26) contain squared terms of vibrational\nvariables of motion y and dy/dt .\n\nAt this point, notice an important feature in\nEq.(13.26). While each translational and\nrotational degree of freedom has contributed only\none ‘squared term’ in Eq.(13.26), one vibrational\nmode contributes two ‘squared terms’ : kinetic\nand potential energies.\n\nEach quadratic term occurring in the\nexpression for energy is a mode of absorption of\nenergy by the molecule. We have seen that in\nthermal equilibrium at absolute temperature T,\nfor each translational mode of motion, the\naverage energy is ½ k\n\nB\nT. The most elegant\n\nprinciple of classical statistical mechanics (first\nproved by Maxwell) states that this is so for each\nmode of energy: translational, rotational and\nvibrational. That is, in equilibrium, the total\nenergy is equally distributed in all possible\nenergy modes, with each mode having an average\nenergy equal to  ½ k\n\nB\nT. This is known as the law\n\nof equipartition of energy. Accordingly, each\ntranslational and rotational degree of freedom\nof a molecule contributes ½ k\n\nB\nT  to the energy,\n\nwhile each vibrational frequency contributes\n2 × ½ k\n\nB\nT  = k\n\nB\nT ,  since a vibrational mode has\n\nboth kinetic and potential energy modes.\nThe proof of the law of equipartition of energy\n\nis beyond the scope of this book. Here, we shall\napply the law to predict the specific heats of\ngases theoretically. Later, we shall also discuss\nbriefly, the application to specific heat  of solids.\n\n13.6  SPECIFIC HEAT CAPACITY\n\n13.6.1 Monatomic Gases\n\nThe molecule of a monatomic gas has only three\ntranslational degrees of freedom.

So it has\n\nU = 3 × 3 k\nB\nT  × N\n\nA\n  = 9 RT\n\nand C = ∆Q/ ∆T =∆ U / ∆T  = 9R .\nThis is the value observed and the agreement\n\nis very good. In the calorie, gram, degree units,\nwater is defined to have unit specific heat. As  1\ncalorie = 4.179 joules and one mole of water\nis 18 grams, the heat capacity per mole is\n~ 75 J mol-1 K-1 ~  9R. However with more\ncomplex  molecules like alcohol or acetone the\narguments, based on degrees of freedom, become\nmore complicated.\n\nLastly, we should note an important aspect\nof the predictions of specific heats, based on the\nclassical law of equipartition of energy. The\npredicted specific heats are independent of\ntemperature. As we go to low temperatures,\nhowever, there is a marked departure from this\nprediction. Specific heats of all substances\napproach zero as T à0.  This is related to the\nfact that degrees of freedom get frozen and\nineffective at low temperatures. According to\nclassical physics, degrees of freedom must\nremain unchanged at all times. The behaviour\nof  specific heats at low temperatures shows the\ninadequacy of classical physics and can be\nexplained only by invoking quantum\nconsiderations, as was first shown by Einstein.\nQuantum mechanics requires a minimum,\nnon-zero amount of energy before a degree of\nfreedom comes into play. This is also the reason\nwhy vibrational degrees of freedom come into play\nonly in some cases.\n\n13.7  MEAN FREE PATH\n\nMolecules in a gas have rather large speeds of\nthe order of the speed of sound. Yet a gas leaking\nfrom a cylinder in a kitchen takes considerable\ntime to diffuse to the other corners of the room.\nThe top of a cloud of smoke holds together for\nhours. This happens because molecules in a gas\nhave a finite though small size, so they are bound\nto undergo collisions. As a result, they cannot\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n336 PHYSICS\n\nt\n\nd\n\nd\n\nv\n\nmove straight unhindered; their paths keep\ngetting incessantly deflected.\n\nFig. 13.7 The volume swept by a molecule in time ∆t\nin which any molecule will collide with it.\n\nSuppose the molecules of a gas are spheres\nof diameter d. Focus on a single molecule with\nthe average speed <v>. It will suffer collision with\nany molecule that comes within a distance d\nbetween the centres. In time ∆t, it sweeps a\nvolume πd2 <v> ∆t wherein any other molecule\n\nwill collide with it (see Fig. 13.7). If n is the\nnumber of molecules per unit volume, the\nmolecule suffers nπd2 <v> ∆t  collisions in time\n∆t. Thus the rate of collisions is  nπd2 <v> or the\ntime between two successive collisions is on the\naverage,\n\nτ  = 1/(nπ <v> d2 ) (13.38)\nThe average distance between two successive\n\ncollisions, called the mean free path l, is :\nl  = <v> τ = 1/(nπd2) (13.39)\nIn this derivation, we imagined the other\n\nmolecules to be at rest. But actually all molecules\nare moving and the collision rate is determined\nby the average relative velocity of the molecules.\nThus we need to replace <v> by <v\n\nr\n> in Eq.\n\n(13.38). A more exact treatment gives\n\n( )21/ 2l n dπ= (13.40)\nLet us estimate l and τ  for air molecules with\n\naverage speeds  <v> = ( 485m/s).

Almost but not quite.  One can see pollen grains of a flower being\npushed around by molecules of water. The size of the grain is ~ 10-5 m.  In 1827, a Scottish botanist\nRobert Brown, while examining, under a microscope, pollen grains of a flower suspended in water\nnoticed that they continuously moved about in a zigzag, random fashion.\n\nKinetic theory provides a simple explanation of the phenomenon. Any object suspended in water is\ncontinuously bombarded from all sides by the water molecules. Since the motion of molecules is random,\nthe number of molecules hitting the object in any direction is about the same as the number hitting in\nthe opposite direction. The small difference between these molecular hits is negligible compared to the\ntotal number of hits for an object of ordinary size, and we do not notice any movement of the object.\n\nWhen the object is sufficiently small but still visible under a microscope, the difference in molecular\nhits from different directions is not altogether negligible, i.e. the impulses and the torques given to the\nsuspended object through continuous bombardment by the molecules of the medium (water or some\nother fluid) do not exactly sum to zero. There is a net impulse and torque in this or that direction. The\nsuspended object thus, moves about in a zigzag manner and tumbles about randomly.  This motion\ncalled now ‘Brownian motion’ is a visible proof of molecular activity. In the last 50 years or so  molecules\nhave been seen by scanning tunneling and other special microscopes.\n\nIn 1987 Ahmed Zewail, an Egyptian scientist working in USA was able to observe not only the\nmolecules but also their detailed interactions. He did this by illuminating them with flashes of laser\nlight for very short durations, of the order of tens of femtoseconds and photographing them.  ( 1 femto-\nsecond = 10-15 s ). One could study even the formation and breaking of chemical bonds. That is really\nseeing !\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nKINETIC THEORY 337\n\nt\n\nAs expected, the mean free path given by\nEq. (13.40) depends inversely on the number\ndensity and the size of the molecules. In a highly\nevacuated tube n is rather small and the mean\nfree path can be as large as the length of the\ntube.\n\nExample 13.9 Estimate the mean free path\nfor a water molecule in water vapour at 373 K.\nUse information from Exercises 13.1 and\nEq. (13.41) above.\n\nAnswer The d for water vapour is same as that\nof air. The number density is inversely\nproportional to absolute temperature.\n\nSo \n25 25 –32732.7 10 2 10 m\n\n373\nn = × × = ×\n\nHence, mean free path –74 10 ml = × t\nNote that the mean free path is 100 times the\n\ninteratomic distance ~ 40 Å = 4 ×10-9 m calculated\nearlier. It is this large value of mean free path that\nleads to the typical gaseous behaviour. Gases can\nnot be confined without a container.\n\nUsing, the kinetic theory of gases, the bulk\nmeasurable properties like viscosity, heat\nconductivity and diffusion can be related to the\nmicroscopic parameters like molecular size. It\nis through such relations that the molecular\nsizes were first estimated.\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. The ideal gas equation connecting pressure (P ), volume (V ) and absolute temperature\n(T ) is\n\n                                         PV = µ RT     = k\nB\n NT\n\nwhere µ is the number of moles and N is the number of molecules. R and k\nB\n are universal\n\nconstants.\n\nR = 8.314 J mol–1 K–1,     k\nB\n  = \n\nA\n\nR\n\nN  \n  = 1.38 × 10–23 J K–1\n\nReal gases satisfy the ideal gas equation only approximately, more so at low pressures\nand high temperatures.\n\n2. Kinetic theory of an ideal gas gives the relation\n\n                                        \n21\n\n3\nP   n m v=\n\nwhere n is number density of molecules, m the mass of the molecule and 2v    is the\n\nmean of squared speed. Combined with the ideal gas equation it yields a kinetic\ninterpretation of temperature.\n\n21 3\n2 2\n\nB m v    k  T= ,  ( )1/22 rmsv v= 3 Bk T\nm\n\n=\n\nThis tells us that  the temperature of a gas is a measure of the average kinetic energy\nof a molecule, independent of the nature of the gas or molecule. In a mixture of gases at\na fixed temperature the heavier molecule has the lower average speed.\n\n3. The translational kinetic energy\n\nE = \n\n2\n\n3\n k\n\nB \nNT.\n\nThis leads to a relation\n\nPV = \n2\n\n3\n E\n\n4. The law of equipartition of energy states that if a system is in equilibrium at absolute\ntemperature T, the total energy is distributed equally in different energy modes of\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n338 PHYSICS\n\nabsorption, the energy in each mode being equal to ½ k\nB\n T. Each translational and\n\nrotational degree of freedom corresponds to one energy mode of absorption and has\nenergy ½ k\n\nB\n T. Each vibrational frequency has two modes of energy (kinetic and potential)\n\nwith corresponding energy equal to\n2 × ½ k\n\nB\n T = k\n\nB\n T.\n\n5. Using the law of equipartition of energy, the molar specific heats of gases can be\ndetermined and the values are in agreement with the experimental values of specific\nheats of several gases. The agreement can be improved by including vibrational modes\nof motion.\n\n6. The mean free path l is the average distance covered by a molecule between two successive\ncollisions :\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2 π\n = l\n\n n  d\n\nwhere n is the number density and d the diameter of the molecule.\n\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n1. Pressure of a fluid is not only exerted on the wall. Pressure exists everywhere in a fluid.\n\nAny layer of gas inside the volume of a container is in equilibrium because the pressure\nis the same on both sides of the layer.\n\n2. We should not have an exaggerated idea of the intermolecular distance in a gas. At\nordinary pressures and temperatures, this is only 10 times or so the interatomic distance\nin solids and liquids. What is different is the mean free path which in a gas is 100\ntimes the interatomic distance and 1000 times the size of the molecule.\n\n3. The law of equipartition of energy is stated thus: the energy for each degree of freedom\nin thermal equilibrium is ½ k\n\nB\n T. Each quadratic term in the total energy expression of\n\na molecule is to be counted as a degree of freedom. Thus, each vibrational mode gives\n2 (not 1) degrees of freedom (kinetic and potential energy modes), corresponding to the\nenergy 2 × ½ k\n\nB\n T = k\n\nB\n T.\n\n4. Molecules of air in a room do not all fall and settle on the ground (due to gravity)\nbecause of their high speeds and incessant collisions. In equilibrium, there is a very\nslight increase in density at lower heights (like in the atmosphere). The effect is small\nsince the potential energy (mgh) for ordinary heights is much less than the average\nkinetic energy ½ mv2 of the molecules.\n\n5. < v2 >  is not always equal to ( < v >)2. The average of a squared quantity is not necessarily\nthe square of the average. Can you find examples for this statement.\n\nEXERCISESEXERCISESEXERCISESEXERCISESEXERCISES\n\n13.113.113.113.113.1 Estimate the fraction of molecular volume to the actual volume occupied by oxygen\ngas at STP.
