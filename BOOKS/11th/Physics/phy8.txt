(A particle is ideally represented as a\npoint mass having no size.)  We applied the results of our\nstudy even to the motion of bodies of finite size, assuming\nthat motion of such bodies can be described in terms of the\nmotion of a particle.\n\nAny real body which we encounter in daily life has a\nfinite size.  In dealing with the motion of extended bodies\n(bodies of finite size) often the idealised model of a particle is\ninadequate.  In this chapter we shall try to go beyond this\ninadequacy.  We shall attempt to build an understanding of\nthe motion of extended bodies.  An extended body, in the\nfirst place, is a system of particles.  We shall begin with the\nconsideration of motion of the system as a whole.  The centre\nof mass of a system of particles will be a key concept here.\nWe shall discuss the motion of the centre of mass of a system\nof particles and usefulness of this concept in understanding\nthe motion of extended bodies.\n\nA large class of problems with extended bodies can be\nsolved by considering them to be rigid bodies.  Ideally a\nrigid body is a body with a perfectly definite and\nunchanging shape.  The distances between all pairs of\nparticles of such a body do not change. It is evident from\nthis definition of a rigid body that no real body is truly rigid,\nsince real bodies deform under the influence of forces. But in\nmany situations the deformations are negligible.  In a number\nof situations involving bodies such as wheels, tops, steel\nbeams, molecules and planets on the other hand, we can ignore\nthat they warp (twist out of shape), bend or vibrate and treat\nthem as rigid.\n\n7.1.1 What kind of motion can a rigid body have?\n\nLet us try to explore this question by taking some examples\nof the motion of rigid bodies.  Let us begin with a rectangular\n\n7.1 Introduction\n\n7.2 Centre of mass\n\n7.3 Motion of centre of mass\n\n7.4 Linear momentum of a\nsystem of particles\n\n7.5 Vector product of two\nvectors\n\n7.6 Angular velocity and its\nrelation with linear velocity\n\n7.7 Torque and angular\nmomentum\n\n7.8 Equilibrium of a rigid body\n\n7.9 Moment of inertia\n\n7.10 Theorems of perpendicular\nand parallel axes\n\n7.11 Kinematics of rotational\nmotion about a fixed axis\n\n7.12 Dynamics of rotational\nmotion about a fixed axis\n\n7.13 Angular momentum in case\nof rotation about a fixed axis\n\n7.14 Rolling motion\n\nSummary\n\nPoints to Ponder\n\nExercises\n\nAdditional exercises\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n142 PHYSICS\n\nblock sliding down an inclined plane without any\nsidewise movement.  The block is taken as a rigid\nbody.  Its motion down the plane is such that all\nthe particles of the body are moving together,\ni.e. they have the same velocity at any instant\nof time. The rigid body here is in pure\ntranslational motion (Fig. 7.1).\n\nIn pure translational motion at any\ninstant of time, all particles of the body have\nthe same velocity.\n\nConsider now the rolling motion of a solid\nmetallic or wooden cylinder down the same\ninclined plane (Fig. 7.2). The rigid body in this\nproblem, namely the cylinder, shifts from the\ntop to the bottom of the inclined plane, and thus,\nseems to have translational motion.  But as Fig.\n7.2 shows, all its particles are not moving with\nthe same velocity at any instant. The body,\ntherefore, is not in pure translational motion.\nIts motion is translational plus ‘something else.’\n\nIn order to understand what this ‘something\nelse’ is, let us take a rigid body so constrained\nthat it cannot have translational motion.  The\n\nmost common way to constrain a rigid body so\nthat it does not have translational motion is to\nfix it along a straight line. The only possible\nmotion of such a rigid body is rotation. The line\nor fixed axis about which the body is rotating is\nits axis of rotation. If you look around, you will\ncome across many examples of rotation about\nan axis, a ceiling fan, a potter’s wheel, a giant\nwheel in a fair, a merry-go-round and so on (Fig\n7.3(a) and (b)).\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\nFig. 7.3 Rotation about a fixed axis\n\n(a) A ceiling fan\n\n(b) A potter’s wheel.\n\nLet us try to understand what rotation is,\nwhat characterises rotation.  You may notice that\nin rotation of a rigid body about a fixed axis,\n\nFig 7.1 Translational (sliding) motion of a block down\nan inclined plane.\n\n(Any point like P\n1\n or P\n\n2 \nof the block moves\n\nwith the same velocity at any instant of time.)\n\nFig. 7.2 Rolling motion of a cylinder. It is not pure\ntranslational motion. Points P\n\n1\n, P\n\n2\n,\n \nP\n\n3\n and P\n\n4\n\nhave different velocities (shown by arrows)\n\nat any instant of time. In fact, the velocity of\n\nthe point of contact P\n3 \nis zero at any instant,\n\nif the cylinder rolls without slipping.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROTATIONAL MOTION 143\n\nevery particle of the body moves in a circle,\nwhich lies in a plane perpendicular to the axis\n\nand has its centre on the axis.  Fig. 7.4 shows\n\nthe rotational motion of a rigid body about a fixed\n\naxis (the z-axis of the frame of reference).  Let P\n1\n\nbe a particle of the rigid body, arbitrarily chosen\n\nand at a distance r\n1\n from fixed axis.  The particle\n\nP\n1\n describes a circle of radius  r\n\n1 \nwith its centre\n\nC\n1\n on the fixed axis.  The circle lies in a plane\n\nperpendicular to the axis. The figure also shows\n\nanother particle P\n2\n of the rigid body, P\n\n2 \nis at a\n\ndistance r\n2 \nfrom the fixed axis. The particle P\n\n2\n\nmoves in a circle of radius r\n2 \nand with centre C\n\n2\n\non the axis. This circle, too, lies in a plane\n\nperpendicular to the axis.  Note that the circles\n\ndescribed by P\n1\n and P\n\n2\n may lie in different planes;\n\nboth these planes, however, are perpendicular\n\nto the fixed axis.  For any particle on the axis\n\nlike P\n3\n, r = 0. Any such particle remains\n\nstationary while the body rotates.  This is\n\nexpected since the axis of rotation is fixed.\n\nFig. 7.5 (a) A spinning top\n(The point of contact of the top with the\n\nground, its tip O, is fixed.)\n\nFig. 7.5 (b) An oscillating table fan with rotating\nblades. The pivot of the fan, point O, is\n\nfixed. The blades of the fan are under\n\nrotational motion, whereas, the axis of\n\nrotation of  the fan blades is oscillating.\n\nFig. 7.4 A rigid body rotation about the z-axis (Each\npoint of the body such as P\n\n1\n or\n\nP\n2\n describes a circle with its centre (C\n\n1\n\nor C\n2\n) on the axis of rotation.  The radius of\n\nthe circle (r\n1\nor r\n\n2\n) is the perpendicular\n\ndistance of the point (P\n1\n or P\n\n2\n) from the\n\naxis. A point on the axis like P\n3 \n\nremains\n\nstationary).\n\nAxis of oscillation\n\nAxis of\nrotation\n\nfrom blades\n\nIn some examples of rotation, however, the\naxis may not be fixed.  A prominent example of\nthis kind of rotation is a top spinning in place\n[Fig. 7.5(a)].  (We assume that the top does not\nslip from place to place and so does not have\ntranslational motion.)  We know from experience\nthat the axis of such a spinning top moves\naround the vertical through its point of contact\nwith the ground, sweeping out a cone as shown\nin Fig. 7.5(a).  (This movement of the axis of the\ntop around the vertical is termed precession.)\nNote, the point of contact of the top with\nground is fixed. The axis of rotation of the top\nat any instant passes through the point of\ncontact. Another simple example of this kind of\nrotation is the oscillating table fan or a pedestal\nfan [Fig.7.5(b)]. You may have observed that the\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n144 PHYSICS\n\naxis of rotation of such a fan has an oscillating\n(sidewise) movement in a horizontal plane about\nthe vertical through the point at which the axis\nis pivoted (point O in Fig. 7.5(b)).\n\nWhile the fan rotates and its axis moves\nsidewise, this point is fixed.  Thus, in more\ngeneral cases of rotation, such as the rotation\nof a top or a pedestal fan, one point and not\none line, of the rigid body is fixed. In this case\nthe axis is not fixed, though it always passes\nthrough the fixed point. In our study, however,\nwe mostly deal with the simpler and special case\nof rotation in which one line (i.e. the axis) is fixed.\n\nThus, for us rotation will be about a fixed axis\nonly unless stated otherwise.\n\nThe rolling motion of a cylinder down an\ninclined plane is a combination of rotation about\na fixed axis and translation.  Thus, the\n‘something else’ in the case of rolling motion\nwhich we referred to earlier is rotational motion.\nYou will find Fig. 7.6(a) and (b) instructive from\nthis point of view. Both these figures show\nmotion of the same body along identical\ntranslational trajectory. In one case, Fig. 7.6(a),\nthe motion is a pure translation; in the other\ncase [Fig. 7.6(b)] it is a combination of\ntranslation and rotation. (You may try to\nreproduce the two types of motion shown, using\na rigid object like a heavy book.)\n\nWe now recapitulate the most important\nobservations of the present section: The motion\nof a rigid body which is not pivoted or fixed in\nsome way is either a pure translation or a\ncombination of translation and rotation. The\nmotion of a rigid body which is pivoted or fixed\nin some way is rotation.  The rotation may be\nabout an axis that is fixed (e.g. a ceiling fan) or\nmoving (e.g. an oscillating table fan [Fig.7.5(b)]).\nWe shall, in the present chapter, consider\nrotational motion about a fixed axis only.\n\n7.2  CENTRE OF MASS\n\nWe shall first see what the centre of mass of a\nsystem of particles is and then discuss its\nsignificance. For simplicity we shall start with\na two particle system. We shall take the line\njoining the two particles to be the x- axis.\n\nFig. 7.7\n\nLet the distances of the two particles be x\n1\n\nand x\n2\n respectively from some origin O. Let m\n\n1\n\nand m\n2\n be respectively the masses of the two\n\nFig. 7.6(a) Motion of a rigid body which is pure\n\ntranslation.\n\nFig. 7.6(b) Motion of a rigid body which is a\ncombination of translation and\n\nrotation.\n\nFig 7.6 (a) and 7.6 (b) illustrate different motions of\n\nthe same body. Note P is an arbitrary point of the\n\nbody; O is the centre of mass of the body, which is\n\ndefined in the next section. Suffice to say here that\n\nthe trajectories of O are the translational trajectories\n\nTr\n1\n and Tr\n\n2 \nof the body. The positions O and P at\n\nthree different instants of time are shown by O\n1\n, O\n\n2\n,\n\nand O\n3\n, and P\n\n1\n, P\n\n2\n and P\n\n3\n, respectively, in both\n\nFigs. 7.6 (a) and (b) . As seen from Fig. 7.6(a), at any\n\ninstant the velocities of any particles like O and P of\n\nthe body are the same in pure translation. Notice, in\n\nthis case the orientation of OP, i.e. the angle OP makes\n\nwith a fixed direction, say the horizontal, remains\n\nthe same, i.e. α\n1 \n\n= α\n2\n = α\n\n3\n. Fig. 7.6 (b) illustrates a\n\ncase of combination of translation and rotation. In\n\nthis case, at any instants the velocities of O and P\n\ndiffer. Also, α\n1\n, α\n\n2\n and α\n\n3\n may all be different.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROTATIONAL MOTION 145\n\nparticles. The centre of mass of the system is\nthat   point C which is at a distance X from O,\nwhere X is given by\n\n1 1 2 2\n\n1 2\n\nm x m x\nX\n\nm m\n\n+\n=\n\n+ (7.1)\n\nIn Eq. (7.1), X can be regarded as the mass-\nweighted mean of  x\n\n1 \nand x\n\n2\n. If the two particles\n\nhave the same mass m\n1\n = m\n\n2\n = m\n\n, \nthen\n\n1 2 1 2\n\n2 2\n\nmx mx x x\nX\n\nm\n\n+ +\n= =\n\nThus, for two particles of equal mass the\ncentre of mass lies exactly midway between\nthem.\n\n       If we have n particles of masses m\n1\n, m\n\n2\n,\n\n...m\nn\n respectively, along a straight line taken as\n\nthe x- axis, then by definition the position of the\ncentre of the mass of the system of particles is\ngiven by.\n\nX\nm x m x m x\n\nm m m\n\nm x\n\nm\n\nm x\n\nm\nn n\n\nn\n\ni i\n\ni\n\nn\n\ni\n\ni\n\nn\n\ni i\n\ni\n\n= = =\n=\n\n=\n\n∑\n\n∑\n\n∑\n∑\n\n1 1 2 2\n\n1 2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n+ + ... +\n\n+ +... +\n  (7.2)\n\nwhere  x\n1\n, x\n\n2\n,...x\n\nn\n are the distances of the\n\nparticles from the origin; X is also measured from\n\nthe same origin. The symbol \uf001 (the Greek letter\nsigma) denotes summation, in this case over n\nparticles. The sum\n\nim M=\uf001\nis the total mass of the system.\n\nSuppose that we have three particles, not\nlying in a straight line. We may define x– and y–\naxes in the plane in which the particles lie and\nrepresent the positions of the three particles by\ncoordinates (x\n\n1\n,y\n\n1\n), (x\n\n2\n,y\n\n2\n) and (x\n\n3\n,y\n\n3\n) respectively.\n\nLet the masses of the three particles be m\n1\n, m\n\n2\n\nand m\n3 \nrespectively. The centre of mass C of\n\nthe system of the three particles is defined and\nlocated by the coordinates (X, Y) given by\n\n1 1 2 2 3 3\n\n1 2 3\n\nm x m x m x\nX\n\nm m m\n\n+ +\n=\n\n+ + (7.3a)\n\n1 1 2 2 3 3\n\n1 2 3\n\nm y m y m y\nY\n\nm m m\n\n+ +\n=\n\n+ + (7.3b)\n\nFor the particles of equal mass m = m\n1\n = m\n\n2\n\n= m\n3\n,\n\n1 2 3 1 2 3( )\n\n3 3\n\nm x x x x x x\nX\n\nm\n\n+ + + +\n= =\n\n1 2 3 1 2 3( )\n\n3 3\n\nm y y y y y y\nY\n\nm\n\n+ + + +\n= =\n\nThus, for three particles of equal mass, the\ncentre of mass coincides with the centroid of the\ntriangle formed by the particles.\n\nResults of Eqs. (7.3a) and (7.3b) are\ngeneralised easily to a system of n particles, not\nnecessarily lying in a plane, but distributed in\nspace. The centre of mass of such a system is\nat (X, Y, Z ), where\n\ni im x\nX\n\nM\n= \uf001 (7.4a)\n\ni im y\nY\n\nM\n= \uf001 (7.4b)\n\nand  \ni im z\n\nZ\nM\n\n= \uf001 (7.4c)\n\nHere M = im\uf001 is the total mass of the\nsystem. The index i runs from 1 to n; m\n\ni\n is the\n\nmass of the ith particle and the position of the\nith particle is given by (x\n\ni\n, y\n\ni\n, z\n\ni\n).\n\nEqs. (7.4a), (7.4b) and (7.4c) can be\ncombined into one equation using the notation\n\nof position vectors. Let  ir  be the position vector\n\nof the ith particle and R be the position vector of\nthe centre of mass:\n\n \uf001\ni i i ix y z= + +r i j k\n\n\uf002 \uf002\n\nand \uf001X Y Z= + +R i j k\uf002 \uf002\n\nThen  \ni im\n\nM\n= \uf001 rR (7.4d)\n\nThe sum on the right hand side is a vector\nsum.\n\nNote the economy of expressions we achieve\nby use of vectors. If the origin of the frame of\nreference (the coordinate system) is chosen to\n\nbe the centre of mass then  0i im =\uf001 r for the\ngiven system of particles.\n\nA rigid body, such as a metre stick or a\nflywheel, is a system of closely packed particles;\nEqs. (7.4a), (7.4b), (7.4c) and (7.4d) are\ntherefore, applicable to a rigid body. The number\nof particles (atoms or molecules) in such a body\nis so large that it is impossible to carry out the\nsummations over individual particles in these\nequations. Since the spacing of the particles is\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n146 PHYSICS\n\nsmall, we can treat the body as a continuous\ndistribution of mass. We subdivide the body into\nn small elements of mass;  ∆m\n\n1\n, ∆m\n\n2\n... ∆m\n\nn\n; the\n\nith element  ∆m\ni \nis taken to be located about the\n\npoint  (x\ni\n, y\n\ni\n, z\n\ni\n). The coordinates of the centre of\n\nmass are then approximately given by\n\n( ) ( ) ( )\n, ,\n\ni i i i i i\n\ni i i\n\nm x m y m z\nX Y Z\n\nm m m\n\n∆ ∆ ∆\n= = =\n\n∆ ∆ ∆\n\uf001 \uf001 \uf001\n\uf001 \uf001 \uf001\n\nAs we make n bigger and bigger and each\n∆m\n\ni\n smaller and smaller, these expressions\n\nbecome exact. In that case, we denote the sums\nover i by integrals. Thus,\n\n∆m m Mi → =∫∑ d ,\n\n( ) ,∆m x x mi i → ∫∑ d\n\n( ) ,∆m y y mi i → ∫∑ d\n\n and (∆m z z mi i) → ∫∑ d\nHere M is the total mass of the body. The\n\ncoordinates of the centre of mass now are\n\nX\nM\n\nx m Y\nM\n\ny m Z\nM\n\nz m= = =∫∫ ∫\n1 1 1\n\nd d d, and   (7.5a)\n\nThe vector expression equivalent to these\nthree scalar expressions is\n\nR r= ∫\n1\n\nM\nmd (7.5b)\n\nIf we choose, the centre of mass as the origin\nof our coordinate system,\n\n=R 0\n\ni.e., r 0dm =∫\nor x m y m z md d d= = =∫ ∫∫ 0 (7.6)\n\nOften we have to calculate the centre of mass\nof homogeneous bodies of regular shapes like\nrings, discs, spheres, rods etc. (By a\nhomogeneous body we mean a body with\nuniformly distributed mass.) By using symmetry\nconsideration, we can easily show that the\ncentres of mass of these bodies lie at their\ngeometric centres.\n\nLet us consider a thin rod, whose width and\nbreath (in case the cross section of the rod is\nrectangular) or radius (in case the cross section\nof the rod is cylindrical) is much smaller than\nits length. Taking the origin to be at the\ngeometric centre of the rod and x-axis to be\nalong the length of the rod, we can say that on\naccount of reflection symmetry, for every\nelement dm of the rod at x, there is an element\nof the same mass dm located at –x (Fig. 7.8).\n\nThe net contribution of every such pair to\n\nthe integral and hence the integral  itself\n\nis zero.  From Eq. (7.6), the point for which the\nintegral  itself is zero, is the centre of mass.\nThus, the centre of mass of a homogenous thin\nrod coincides with its geometric centre. This can\nbe understood on the basis of reflection symmetry.\n\nThe same symmetry argument will apply to\nhomogeneous rings, discs, spheres, or even\nthick rods of circular or rectangular cross\nsection. For all such bodies you will realise that\nfor every element dm at a point (x, y, z ) one can\nalways take an element of the same mass at\nthe point (–x, –y, –z ). (In other words, the origin\nis a point of reflection symmetry for these\nbodies.) As a result, the integrals in Eq. (7.5 a)\nall are zero. This means that for all the above\nbodies, their centre of mass coincides with their\ngeometric centre.\n\nExample 7.1 Find the centre of mass of\nthree particles at the vertices of an\nequilateral triangle. The masses of the\nparticles are 100g, 150g, and 200g\nrespectively.

Why? \uf074\n\nExample 7.2  Find the centre of mass of a\ntriangular lamina.\n\nAnswer  The lamina (∆LMN ) may be subdivided\ninto narrow strips each parallel to the base (MN)\nas shown in Fig. 7.10\n\nFig. 7.10\n\nBy symmetry each strip has its centre of\nmass at its midpoint. If we join the midpoint of\nall the strips we get the median LP. The centre\nof mass of the triangle as a whole therefore, has\nto lie on the median LP. Similarly, we can argue\nthat it lies on the median MQ and NR. This\nmeans the centre of mass lies on the point of\n\nconcurrence of the medians, i.e. on the centroid\nG of the triangle.       \uf074\n\nExample 7.3 Find the centre of mass of a\nuniform L-shaped lamina (a thin flat plate)\nwith dimensions as shown. The mass of\nthe lamina is 3 kg.\n\nAnswer  Choosing the X and Y axes as shown\nin Fig. 7.11 we have the coordinates of the\nvertices of the L-shaped lamina as given in the\nfigure. We can think of the\nL-shape to consist of 3 squares each of length\n1m. The mass of each square is 1kg, since the\nlamina is uniform. The centres of mass C\n\n1\n, C\n\n2\n\nand C\n3\n of the squares are, by symmetry, their\n\ngeometric centres and have coordinates (1/2,1/2),\n(3/2,1/2), (1/2,3/2) respectively. We take the\nmasses of the squares to be concentrated at\nthese points. The centre of mass of the whole\nL shape (X, Y) is the centre of mass of these\nmass points.\n\nFig. 7.11\n\nHence\n\n[ ]\n( )\n\n1(1/2) 1(3/2) 1(1/2) kg m\n\n1 1 1 kg\nX\n\n+ +\n=\n\n+ +  \n5\n\nm\n6\n\n=\n\n[ ]\n( )\n\n1(1/2) 1(1/2) 1(3/2) kg m 5\nm\n\n1 1 1 kg 6\nY\n\n  + +\n  = =\n\n+ +\n\nThe centre of mass of the L-shape lies on\nthe line OD.

How will you\nthen determine the centre of mass of the lamina?\n\uf074\n\n7.3  MOTION OF CENTRE OF MASS\n\nEquipped with the definition of the centre of\n\nmass, we are now in a position to discuss its\n\nphysical importance for a system of n particles.\n\nWe may rewrite Eq.(7.4d) as\n\n1 1 2 2 ...i i n nM m m m m= = + + +\uf001R r r r r (7.7)\nDifferentiating the two sides of the equation\n\nwith respect to time we get\n\n1 2\n1 2\n\ndd dd\n...\n\nd d d\nn\n\nn\nM m m m\n\nt t t dt\n= + + +\n\nrr rR\n\nor\n\n1 1 2 2 ... n nM m m m= + + +V v v v (7.8)\n\nwhere  ( )1 1d /dt=v r  is the velocity of the first\nparticle ( )2 2d dt=v r is the velocity of the\nsecond particle etc. and d /dt=V R  is the\nvelocity of the centre of mass. Note that we\n\nassumed the masses m\n1\n, m\n\n2\n, ... etc. do not\n\nchange in time. We have therefore, treated them\n\nas constants in differentiating the equations\n\nwith respect to time.\n\nDifferentiating Eq.(7.8) with respect to time,\nwe obtain\n\n1 2\n1 2\n\ndd dd\n...\n\nd d d d\nn\n\nnM m m m\nt t t t\n\n= + + +\nvv vV\n\nor\n\n1 1 2 2\n...\n\nn n\nM m m m= + + +A a a a (7.9)\n\nwhere ( )1 1d /dt=a v  is the acceleration of the\nfirst particle,  ( )2 2d /dt=a v  is the acceleration\nof the second particle etc. and  ( )d /dt=A V  is\nthe acceleration of the centre of mass of the\nsystem of particles.\n\nNow, from Newton’s second law, the force\n\nacting on the first particle is given by 1 1 1m=F a .\nThe force acting on the second particle is given\n\nby 2 2 2m=F a and so on. Eq. (7.9) may be written\nas\n\n1 2 ... nM = + + +A F F F (7.10)\n\nThus, the total mass of a system of particles\ntimes the acceleration of its centre of mass is\nthe vector sum of all the forces acting on the\nsystem of particles.\n\nNote when we talk of the force 1F on the first\n\nparticle, it is not a single force, but the vector\nsum of all the forces on the first particle; likewise\nfor the second particle etc. Among these forces\non each particle there will be external forces\nexerted by bodies outside the system and also\ninternal forces exerted by the particles on one\nanother. We know from Newton’s third law that\nthese internal forces occur in equal and opposite\npairs and in the sum of forces of Eq. (7.10),\ntheir contribution is zero. Only the external\nforces contribute to the equation. We can then\nrewrite Eq. (7.10) as\n\nextM =A F (7.11)\n\nwhere extF  represents the sum of all external\n\nforces acting on the particles of the system.\nEq. (7.11) states that the centre of mass\n\nof a system of particles moves as if all the\nmass of the system was concentrated at the\ncentre of mass and all the external forces\nwere applied at that point.\n\nNotice, to determine the motion of the centre\nof mass no knowledge of internal forces of the\nsystem of particles is required; for this purpose\nwe need to know only the external forces.\n\nTo obtain Eq. (7.11) we did not need to\nspecify the nature of the system of particles.\nThe system may be a collection of particles in\nwhich there may be all kinds of internal\nmotions, or it may be a rigid body which has\neither pure translational motion or a\ncombination of translational and rotational\nmotion. Whatever is the system and the motion\nof its individual particles, the centre of mass\nmoves according to Eq. (7.11).\n\nInstead of treating extended bodies as single\nparticles as we have done in earlier chapters,\nwe can now treat them as systems of particles.\nWe can obtain the translational component of\ntheir motion, i.e. the motion of the centre of mass\nof the system, by taking the mass of the whole\nsystem to be concentrated at the centre of mass\nand all the external forces on the system to be\nacting at the centre of mass.\n\nThis is the procedure that we followed earlier\nin analysing forces on bodies and solving\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROTATIONAL MOTION 149\n\nproblems without explicitly outlining and\njustifying the procedure. We now realise that in\nearlier studies we assumed, without saying so,\nthat rotational motion and/or internal motion\nof the particles were either absent or negligible.\nWe no longer need to do this. We have not only\nfound the justification of the procedure we\nfollowed earlier; but we also have found how to\ndescribe and separate the translational motion\nof (1) a rigid body which may be rotating as\nwell,  or (2) a system of particles with all kinds\nof internal motion.\n\nFig. 7.12 The centre of mass of the fragments\nof the projectile continues along the\n\nsame parabolic path which it would\n\nhave followed if there were no\n\nexplosion.\n\nFigure 7.12 is a good illustration of Eq.\n(7.11). A projectile, following the usual parabolic\ntrajectory, explodes into fragments midway in\nair. The forces leading to the explosion are\ninternal forces. They contribute nothing to the\nmotion of the centre of mass. The total external\nforce, namely, the force of gravity acting on the\nbody, is the same before and after the explosion.\nThe centre of mass under the influence of the\nexternal force continues, therefore, along the\nsame parabolic trajectory as it would have\nfollowed if there were no explosion.\n\n7.4 LINEAR MOMENTUM OF A SYSTEM OF\nPARTICLES\n\nLet us recall that the linear momentum of a\nparticle is defined as\n\nm=p v (7.12)\nLet us also recall that Newton’s second law\n\nwritten in symbolic form for a single particle is\n\nd\n\ndt\n=\n\np\nF (7.13)\n\nwhere F is the force on the particle. Let us\nconsider a system of n particles with masses m\n\n1\n,\n\nm\n2\n,...m\n\nn \nrespectively and velocities 1 2, ,....... nv v v\n\nrespectively. The particles may be interacting\nand have external forces acting on them. The\n\nlinear momentum of the first particle is 1 1m v ,\n\nof the second particle is 2 2m v  and so on.\n\nFor the system of n particles, the linear\nmomentum of the system is defined to be the\nvector sum of all individual particles of the\nsystem,\n\n1 2 ... n= + + +P p p p\n\n1 1 2 2 ... n nm m m= + + +v v v (7.14)\nComparing this with Eq. (7.8)\n\nM=P V (7.15)\nThus, the total momentum of a system\n\nof particles is equal to the product of the\ntotal mass of the system and the velocity of\nits centre of mass. Differentiating Eq. (7.15)\nwith respect to time,\n\nd d\n\nd d\nM M\n\nt t\n= =\n\nP V\nA (7.16)\n\nComparing Eq.(7.16) and Eq. (7.11),\n\nd\n\nd\next\n\nt\n=\n\nP\nF (7.17)\n\nThis is the statement of Newton’s second law\nof motion extended to a system of particles.\n\nSuppose now, that the sum of external\nforces acting on a system of particles is zero.\nThen from Eq.(7.17)\n\nor\nd\n\n0\ndt\n\n=\nP\n\nP  = Constant (7.18a)\n\nThus, when the total external force acting\non a system of particles is zero, the total linear\nmomentum of the system is constant. This is\nthe law of conservation of the total linear\nmomentum of a system of particles. Because of\nEq. (7.15), this also means that when the\ntotal external force on the system is zero\nthe velocity of the centre of mass remains\nconstant. (We assume throughout the\ndiscussion on systems of particles in this\nchapter that the total mass of the system\nremains constant.)\n\nNote that on account of the internal forces,\ni.e. the forces exerted by the particles on one\nanother, the individual particles may have\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n150 PHYSICS\n\ncomplicated trajectories. Yet, if the total external\nforce acting on the system is zero, the centre of\nmass moves with a constant velocity, i.e., moves\nuniformly in a straight line like a free particle.\n\nThe vector Eq. (7.18a) is equivalent to three\nscalar equations,\n\nP\nx\n = c\n\n1\n, P\n\ny\n = c\n\n2\n and P\n\nz\n = c\n\n3\n(7.18 b)\n\nHere P\nx\n, P\n\ny\n and P\n\nz\n are the components of the\n\ntotal linear momentum vector P along the x–, y–\nand z–axes respectively; c\n\n1\n, c\n\n2\n and c\n\n3\n are\n\nconstants.\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFig. 7.13 (a) A heavy nucleus radium (Ra) splits into\na lighter nucleus radon (Rn) and an alpha\n\nparticle (nucleus of helium atom). The CM\n\nof the system is in uniform motion.\n\n(b) The same spliting of the heavy nucleus\nradium (Ra) with the centre of mass at\n\nrest. The two product particles fly back\n\nto back.\n\nAs an example, let us consider the\nradioactive decay of a moving unstable particle,\nlike the nucleus of radium. A radium nucleus\ndisintegrates into a nucleus of radon and an\nalpha particle. The forces leading to the decay\nare internal to the system and the external\nforces on the system are negligible. So the total\nlinear momentum of the system is the same\nbefore and after decay. The two particles\nproduced in the decay, the radon nucleus and\nthe alpha particle, move in different directions\nin such a way that their centre of mass moves\nalong the same path along which the original\ndecaying radium nucleus was moving\n[Fig. 7.13(a)].\n\nIf we observe the decay from the frame of\nreference in which the centre of mass is at rest,\nthe motion of the particles involved in the decay\nlooks particularly simple; the product particles\n\nmove back to back with their centre of mass\nremaining at rest as shown in Fig.7.13 (b).\n\nIn many problems on the system of\nparticles, as in the above radioactive decay\nproblem, it is convenient to work in the centre\nof mass frame rather than in the laboratory\nframe of reference.\n\nIn astronomy, binary (double) stars is a\ncommon occurrence. If there are no external\nforces, the centre of mass of a double star\nmoves like a free particle, as shown in Fig.7.14\n(a). The trajectories of the two stars of equal\nmass are also shown in the figure; they look\ncomplicated. If we go to the centre of mass\nframe, then we find that there the two stars\nare moving in a circle, about the centre of\nmass, which is at rest. Note that the position\nof the stars have to be diametrically opposite\nto each other [Fig. 7.14(b)]. Thus in our frame\nof reference, the trajectories of the stars are a\ncombination of (i) uniform motion in a straight\nline of the centre of mass and (ii) circular\norbits of the stars about the centre of mass.\n\nAs can be seen from the two examples,\nseparating the motion of different parts of a\nsystem into motion of the centre of mass and\nmotion about the centre of mass is a very\nuseful technique that helps in understanding\nthe motion of the system.\n\n7.5  VECTOR PRODUCT OF TWO VECTORS\n\nWe are already familiar with vectors and their\nuse in physics. In chapter 6 (Work, Energy,\nPower) we defined the scalar product of two\nvectors. An important physical quantity, work,\nis defined as a scalar product of two vector\nquantities, force and displacement.\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFig. 7.14 (a) Trajectories of two stars, S\n1\n (dotted\n\nline) and S\n2\n (solid line) forming a\n\nbinary system with their centre of\n\nmass C in uniform motion.\n\n(b) The same binary system, with the\ncentre of mass C at rest.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROTATIONAL MOTION 151\n\nWe shall now define another product of two\nvectors. This product is a vector. Two important\nquantities in the study of rotational motion,\nnamely, moment of a force and angular\nmomentum, are defined as vector products.\n\nDefinition of Vector Product\n\nA vector product of two vectors a and b is a\nvector c such that\n\n(i) magnitude of c = c sinab θ=  where a and b\nare magnitudes of  a and b and θ is the\nangle between the two vectors.\n\n(ii) c is perpendicular to the plane containing\na and b.\n\n(iii) if we take a right handed screw with its head\nlying in the plane of  a and b and the screw\nperpendicular to this plane, and if we turn\nthe head in the direction from  a to b, then\nthe tip of the screw advances in the direction\nof c. This right handed screw rule is\nillustrated in Fig. 7.15a.\nAlternately, if one curls up the fingers of\n\nright hand around a line perpendicular to the\nplane of the vectors  a and b and if the fingers\nare curled up in the direction from a to b, then\nthe stretched thumb points in the direction of\nc, as shown in Fig. 7.15b.\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFig. 7.15 (a) Rule of the right handed screw for\ndefining the direction of the vector\n\nproduct of two vectors.\n\n                (b) Rule of the right hand for defining the\n\ndirection of the vector product.\n\nA simpler version of the right hand rule is\nthe following : Open up your right hand palm\nand curl the fingers pointing from  a to b. Your\nstretched thumb points in the direction of c.\n\nIt should be remembered that there are two\nangles between any two vectors  a and b . In\nFig. 7.15 (a) or (b) they correspond to θ (as\nshown) and (3600– θ). While applying either of\nthe above rules, the rotation should be taken\nthrough the smaller angle (<1800) between  a\nand b. It is θ here.\n\nBecause of the cross (×) used to denote the\nvector product, it is also referred to as cross product.\n\n• Note that scalar product of two vectors is\ncommutative as said earlier, a.b = b.a\nThe vector product, however, is not\n\ncommutative, i.e. a × b ≠ b × a\nThe magnitude of both a × b and b × a is the\n\nsame ( sinab θ ); also, both of them are\nperpendicular to the plane of  a and b. But the\nrotation of the right-handed screw in case of\na × b  is from  a to b, whereas in case of  b × a it\nis from b to a. This means the two vectors are\nin opposite directions. We have\n\n× = − ×a b b a\n• Another interesting property of a vector\n\nproduct is its behaviour under reflection.\nUnder reflection (i.e. on taking the plane\nmirror image) we have\n\nand ,x x y y z z→ − → − → − . As a result all\nthe components of a vector change sign and\n\nthus ,a a→ − b b→ − . What happens to\na × b under reflection?\n\na × b ( ) ( )→ − × − = ×a b a b\nThus, a × b does not change sign under\n\nreflection.\n\n• Both scalar and vector products are\ndistributive with respect to vector addition.\nThus,\n\n.( ) . .+ = +a b c a b a c\n\n( )× + = × + ×a b c a b a c\n• We may write c = a × b in the component\n\nform. For this we first need to obtain some\nelementary cross products:\n\n(i) a × a = 0 (0 is a null vector, i.e. a vector\nwith zero magnitude)\n\nThis follows since magnitude of a × a  is\n\n2 sin0 0a ° = .\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n152 PHYSICS\n\n\uf075\n\nFrom this follow the results\n\n (i) ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ, ,× = × = × =i i 0 j j 0 k k 0\n\n(ii) ˆ ˆ ˆ× =i j k\n\nNote that the magnitude of ˆ ˆ×i j  is sin900\n\nor 1, since î  and ĵ  both have unit\n\nmagnitude and the angle between them is 900.\n\nThus, ˆ ˆ×i j  is a unit vector. A unit vector\n\nperpendicular to the plane of î  and ĵ  and\n\nrelated to them by the right hand screw rule is\n\nk̂ . Hence, the above result.

We\nhave seen that every particle of a rotating body\nmoves in a circle. The linear velocity of the\nparticle is related to the angular velocity. The\nrelation between these two quantities involves\na vector product which we learnt about in the\nlast section.\n\nLet us go back to Fig. 7.4. As said above, in\nrotational motion of a rigid body about a fixed\naxis, every particle of the body moves in a circle,\n\nFig. 7.16 Rotation about a fixed axis. (A particle (P)\nof the rigid body rotating about the fixed\n\n(z-) axis moves in a circle with centre (C)\n\non the axis.)\n\nwhich lies in a plane perpendicular to the axis\nand has its centre on the axis. In Fig. 7.16 we\nredraw Fig. 7.4, showing a typical particle (at a\npoint P) of the rigid body rotating about a fixed\naxis (taken as the z-axis). The particle describes\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROTATIONAL MOTION 153\n\na circle with a centre C on the axis. The radius\nof the circle is r, the perpendicular distance of\nthe point P from the axis. We also show the\nlinear velocity vector v of the particle at P. It is\nalong the tangent at P to the circle.\n\nLet P′ be the position of the particle after an\ninterval of time ∆t (Fig. 7.16). The angle PCP′\ndescribes the angular displacement ∆θ of the\nparticle in time ∆t. The average angular velocity\nof the particle over the interval  ∆t is ∆θ/∆t. As\n∆t tends to zero (i.e. takes smaller and smaller\nvalues), the ratio ∆θ/∆t approaches a limit which\nis the instantaneous angular velocity dθ/dt of\nthe particle at the position P. We denote the\ninstantaneous angular velocity by  ω (the\nGreek letter omega). We know from our study\nof circular motion that the magnitude of linear\nvelocity  v of a particle moving in a circle is\nrelated to the angular velocity of the particle ω\nby the simple relation rυ ω= , where r is the\nradius of the circle.\n\nWe observe that at any given instant the\nrelation  v rω=  applies to  all particles of the\nrigid body. Thus for a particle at a perpendicular\ndistance r\n\ni\n  from the fixed axis, the linear velocity\n\nat a given instant v\ni\n is given by\n\ni i\nv rω= (7.19)\nThe index i runs from 1 to n, where n is the\n\ntotal number of particles of the body.\n\nFor particles on the axis, 0=r , and hence\nv = ω r = 0. Thus, particles on the axis are\nstationary. This verifies that the axis is fixed.\n\nNote that we use the same angular velocity\nω for all the particles. We therefore, refer to  ωωωωω\nas the angular velocity of the whole body.\n\nWe have characterised pure translation of\n\na body by all parts of the body having the same\nvelocity at any instant of time. Similarly, we\n\nmay characterise pure rotation by all parts of\n\nthe body having the same angular velocity at\nany instant of time. Note that this\n\ncharacterisation of the rotation of a rigid body\n\nabout a fixed axis is just another way of saying\nas in Sec. 7.1 that each particle of the body moves\n\nin a circle, which lies in a plane perpendicular\n\nto the axis and has the centre on the axis.\nIn our discussion so far the angular velocity\n\nappears to be a scalar. In fact, it is a vector. We\nshall not justify this fact, but we shall accept\nit. For rotation about a fixed axis, the angular\nvelocity vector lies along the axis of rotation,\n\nand points out in the direction in which a right\nhanded screw would advance, if the head of the\nscrew is rotated with the body. (See Fig. 7.17a).\n\nThe magnitude of this vector is d dtω θ=\nreferred as above.\n\nFig. 7.17 (a) If the head of a right handed screw\nrotates with the body, the screw\n\nadvances in the direction of the angular\n\nvelocity ωωωωω. If the sense (clockwise or\nanticlockwise) of rotation of the body\n\nchanges, so does the direction of ωωωωω.\n\nFig. 7.17 (b) The angular velocity vector ωωωωω is\ndirected along the fixed axis as shown.\n\nThe linear velocity of the particle at P\n\nis v = ωωωωω × r. It is  perpendicular to both\nω ω ω ω ω and r and is  directed along the\ntangent to the circle described by the\n\nparticle.\n\nWe shall now look at what the vector product\nωωωωω × r corresponds to. Refer to Fig. 7.17(b) which\nis a part of Fig. 7.16 reproduced to show the\npath of the particle P. The figure shows the\nvector ωωωωω directed along the fixed (z–) axis and\nalso the position vector  r = OP  of the particle\n\nat P of the rigid body with respect to the origin\nO. Note that the origin is chosen to be on the\naxis of rotation.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n154 PHYSICS\n\nNow ωωωωω × r = ωωωωω × OP = ωωωωω × (OC + CP)\nBut ωωωωω × OC = 0 0 0 0 0 as ω ω ω ω ω is along OC\nHence ωωωωω × r = ωωωωω × CP\n\nThe vector ωωωωω × CP is perpendicular to ωωωωω, i.e.\nto the z-axis and also to CP, the radius of the\n\ncircle described by the particle at P. It is\n\ntherefore, along the tangent to the circle at P.\n\nAlso, the magnitude of  ωωωωω × CP is ω (CP) since\nωωωωω and CP are perpendicular to each other. We\nshall denote CP by ⊥r  and not by r, as we did\n\nearlier.\n\nThus, ωωωωω × r is a vector of magnitude ωr⊥\nand is along the tangent to the circle described\nby the particle at P. The linear velocity vector v\nat P has the same magnitude and direction.\nThus,\n\nv = ω ω ω ω ω × r (7.20)\nIn fact, the relation, Eq. (7.20), holds good\n\neven for rotation of a rigid body with one point\nfixed, such as the rotation of the top [Fig. 7.6(a)].\nIn this case r represents the position vector of\nthe particle with respect to the fixed point taken\nas the origin.\n\nWe note that for rotation about a fixed\naxis, the direction of the vector ωωωωω does not\nchange with time. Its magnitude may,\nhowever, change from instant to instant. For\nthe more general rotation, both the\nmagnitude and the direction of ω ω ω ω ω may change\nfrom instant to instant.\n\n7.6.1 Angular acceleration\n\nYou may have noticed that we are developing\n\nthe study of rotational motion along the lines\n\nof the study of translational motion with which\n\nwe are already familiar. Analogous to the kinetic\n\nvariables of linear displacement (s) and velocity\n\n(v) in translational motion, we have angular\n\ndisplacement (θθθθθ) and angular velocity (ωωωωω) in\nrotational motion. It is then natural to define\n\nin rotational motion the concept of angular\n\nacceleration in analogy with linear acceleration\n\ndefined as the time rate of change of velocity in\n\ntranslational motion. We define angular\n\nacceleration ααααα as the time rate of change of\nangular velocity; Thus,\n\nd\n\ndt\n=\n\nωωωω\nαααα (7.21)\n\nIf the axis of rotation is fixed, the direction\nof ω ω ω ω ω and hence, that of ααααα is fixed. In this case\nthe vector equation reduces to a scalar equation\n\nd\n\ndt\n\nω\nα = (7.22)\n\n7.7  TORQUE AND ANGULAR MOMENTUM\n\nIn this section, we shall acquaint ourselves with\ntwo physical quantities (torque and angular\nmomentum) which are defined as vector products\nof two vectors. These as we shall see, are\nespecially important in the discussion of motion\nof systems of particles, particularly rigid bodies.\n\n7.7.1 Moment of force (Torque)\n\nWe have learnt that the motion of a rigid body,\n\nin general, is a combination of rotation and\n\ntranslation. If the body is fixed at a point or along\n\na line, it has only rotational motion. We know\n\nthat force is needed to change the translational\n\nstate of a body, i.e. to produce linear\n\nacceleration. We may then ask, what is the\n\nanalogue of force in the case of rotational\n\nmotion? To look into the question in a concrete\n\nsituation let us take the example of opening or\n\nclosing of a door. A door is a rigid body which\n\ncan rotate about a fixed vertical axis passing\n\nthrough the hinges. What makes the door\n\nrotate? It is clear that unless a force is applied\n\nthe door does not rotate. But any force does not\n\ndo the job. A force applied to the hinge line\n\ncannot produce any rotation at all, whereas a\n\nforce of given magnitude applied at right angles\n\nto the door at its outer edge is most effective in\n\nproducing rotation. It is not the force alone, but\n\nhow and where the force is applied is important\n\nin rotational motion.\n\nThe rotational analogue of force in linear\n\nmotion is moment of force. It is also referred to\n\nas torque or couple. (We shall use the words\n\nmoment of force and torque interchangeably.)\n\nWe shall first define the moment of force for the\n\nspecial case of a single particle. Later on we\n\nshall extend the concept to systems of particles\n\nincluding rigid bodies. We shall also relate it to\n\na change in the state of rotational motion, i.e. is\n\nangular acceleration of a rigid body.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROTATIONAL MOTION 155\n\nFig. 7.18 τ = τ = τ = τ = τ = r ×  ×  ×  ×  × F, τ τ τ τ τ is perpendicular to the plane\ncontaining r and F, and its direction is\n\ngiven by the right handed screw rule.\n\nIf a force acts on a single particle at a point\nP whose position with respect to the origin O is\ngiven by the position vector r (Fig. 7.18), the\nmoment of the force acting on the particle with\nrespect to the origin O is defined as the vector\nproduct\n\nτττττ = r     × F (7.23)\nThe moment of force (or torque) is a vector\n\nquantity. The symbol τ τ τ τ τ stands for the Greek\nletter tau. The magnitude of τ τ τ τ τ is\n\nτ = r F sinθ (7.24a)\nwhere r is the magnitude of the position vector\nr, i.e. the length OP, F is the magnitude of force\nF and θ     is the angle between r and F as\nshown.\n\nMoment of force has dimensions M L2 T -2.\nIts dimensions are the same as those of work\nor energy. It is, however, a very different physical\nquantity than work. Moment of a force is a\nvector, while work is a scalar. The SI unit of\nmoment of force is newton metre (N m). The\nmagnitude of the moment of force may be\nwritten\n\n( sin )r F r Fτ θ ⊥= = (7.24b)\n\nor sinr F rFτ θ ⊥= = (7.24c)\n\nwhere r⊥  = r sinθ is the perpendicular distance\n\nof the line of action of F from the origin and\n( sin )F F θ⊥ = is the component of F in the\n\ndirection perpendicular to r. Note that τ = 0 if\nr = 0, F = 0 or θ = 00 or 1800 . Thus, the moment\nof a force vanishes if either the magnitude of\nthe force is zero, or if the line of action of the\nforce passes through the origin.\n\nOne may note that since  r × F is a vector\nproduct, properties of a vector product of two\nvectors apply to it. If the direction of F is\nreversed, the direction of the moment of force\nis reversed. If directions of both r and F are\nreversed, the direction of the moment of force\nremains the same.\n\n7.7.2 Angular momentum of a particle\n\nJust as the moment of a force is the rotational\nanalogue of force in linear motion, the quantity\nangular momentum is the rotational analogue\nof linear momentum. We shall first define\nangular momentum for the special case of a\nsingle particle and look at its usefulness in the\ncontext of single particle motion. We shall then\nextend the definition of angular momentum to\nsystems of particles including rigid bodies.\n\nLike moment of a force, angular momentum\nis also a vector product. It could also be referred\nto as moment of (linear) momentum. From this\nterm one could guess how angular momentum\nis defined.\n\nConsider a particle of mass m and linear\nmomentum p at a position r relative to the origin\nO. The angular momentum l of the particle with\nrespect to the origin O is defined to be\n\nl = r ×  ×  ×  ×  × p (7.25a)\nThe magnitude of the angular momentum\n\nvector is\n\nsinl r p= θ (7.26a)\nwhere p is the magnitude of p and θ is the angle\nbetween r and p. We may write\n\nl r p⊥=  or r p⊥                                   (7.26b)\n\nwhere r⊥  (= r sinθ) is the perpendicular distance\nof the directional line of  p from the origin and\n\n( sin )p p θ⊥ =  is the component of p in a direction\nperpendicular to r. We expect the angular\nmomentum to be zero (l = 0), if the linear\nmomentum vanishes (p = 0), if the particle is at\nthe origin (r = 0), or if the directional line of  p\npasses through the origin θ = 00 or 1800.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n156 PHYSICS\n\nThe physical quantities, moment of a force\nand angular momentum, have an important\nrelation between them. It is the rotational\nanalogue of the relation between force and linear\nmomentum. For deriving the relation in the\ncontext of a single particle, we differentiate\n\nl  = r × p with respect to time,\n\nd d\n( )\n\nd d\n= ×r p\n\nt t\n\nl\n\nApplying the product rule for differentiation\nto the right hand side,\n\nd d d\n( )\n\nd d dt t t\n× = × + ×\n\nr p\nr p p r\n\nNow, the velocity of the particle is v = dr/dt\nand p = m v\n\nBecause of this \nd\n\n0,\nd\n\nm\nt\n\n× = × =\nr\n\np v v\n\nas the vector product of two parallel vectors\nvanishes. Further, since dp / dt = F,\n\nr\np\n\nr F× = × =\nd\n\ndt\nττ\n\nHence \nd\n\ndt\n( )r p× = ττ\n\nor  (7.27)\n\nThus, the time rate of change of the angular\nmomentum of a particle is equal to the torque\nacting on it. This is the rotational analogue of\nthe equation F = dp/dt, which expresses\nNewton’s second law for the translational motion\nof a single particle.\n\nTorque and angular momentum for a system\nof particles\n\nTo get the total angular momentum of a system\nof particles about a given point we need to add\nvectorially the angular momenta of individual\nparticles. Thus, for a system of n particles,\n\nThe angular momentum of the ith   particle\nis given by\n\nl\ni\n = r\n\ni\n × p\n\ni\n\nwhere r\ni\n is the position vector of the ith particle\n\nwith respect to a given origin and p = (m\ni\nv\n\ni\n) is\n\nthe linear momentum of the particle. (The\n\nparticle has mass m\ni\n and velocity v\n\ni\n) We may\n\nwrite the total angular momentum of a system\nof particles as\n\n(7.25b)\n\nThis is a generalisation of the definition of\nangular momentum (Eq. 7.25a) for a single\nparticle to a system of particles.\n\nUsing Eqs. (7.23) and (7.25b), we get\n\nd\n\nd\n\nd\n\nd\n\nd\n\nd\n\nL\n\nt t t\ni i\n\nii\n\n= ( ) = = ∑∑∑∑l\nl\n\nτ (7.28a)\n\nAn experiment with the bicycle rim\n\nTake a\nbicycle rim\nand extend\nits axle on\nboth sides.\nTie two\ns t r i n g s\nat both ends\nA and B,\nas shown\nin the\na d j o i n i n g\nfigure.  Hold\nboth the\ns t r i n g s\ntogether in\n\none hand such that the rim is vertical. If you\nleave one string, the rim will tilt. Now keeping\nthe rim in vertical position with both the strings\nin one hand, put the wheel in fast rotation\naround the axle with the other hand. Then leave\none string, say B, from your hand, and observe\nwhat happens.\n\nThe rim keeps rotating in a vertical plane\nand the plane of rotation turns around the\nstring A which you are holding. We say that the\naxis of rotation of the rim or equivalently\nits angular momentum precesses about the\nstring A.\n\nThe rotating rim gives rise to an angular\nmomentum. Determine the direction of this\nangular momentum. When you are holding the\nrotating rim with string A, a torque is generated.\n(We leave it to you to find out how the torque is\ngenerated and what its direction is.) The effect\nof the torque on the angular momentum is to\nmake it precess around an axis perpendicular\nto both the angular momentum and the torque.\nVerify all these statements.\n\nInitially After\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROTATIONAL MOTION 157\n\n\uf075\n\n\uf075\n\nwhere τττττ\ni \nis the torque acting on the ith particle;\n\nττi i i= ×r F\nThe force F\n\ni \non the ith particle is the vector\n\nsum of external forces Fi\next  acting on the particle\n\nand the internal forces int\niF  exerted on it by the\n\nother particles of the system. We may therefore\nseparate the contribution of the external and\nthe internal forces to the total torque\n\nττ ττ= = ×∑ ∑i\ni\n\ni\n\ni\n\ni\nr F\n\n as\n\nττ ττ ττ= +ext int ,\n\nwhere   \nττext i i\n\next\n\ni\n\n= ×∑ r F\n\nand\nττint\n\nint= ×∑ r Fi i\ni\n\nWe shall assume not only Newton’s third law\n\nof motion, i.e. the forces between any two particles\n\nof the system are equal and opposite, but also that\n\nthese forces are directed along the line joining the\n\ntwo particles. In this case the contribution of the\n\ninternal forces to the total torque on the system is\n\nzero, since the torque resulting from each action-\n\nreaction pair of forces is zero. We thus have, τττττ\nint\n\n =\n\n0 and therefore τττττ\n \n = τ τ τ τ τ\n\next\n.\n\nSince ττ ττ= ∑ i , it follows from Eq. (7.28a)\nthat\n\nd\n\nd\n\nL\n\nt\next= ττ (7.28 b)\n\nThus, the time rate of the total angular\n\nmomentum of a system of particles about a\n\npoint (taken as the origin of our frame of\n\nreference) is equal to the sum of the external\n\ntorques (i.e. the torques due to external forces)\n\nacting on the system taken about the same\n\npoint. Eq. (7.28 b) is the generalisation of the\n\nsingle particle case of Eq. (7.23) to a system of\n\nparticles. Note that when we have only one\n\nparticle, there are no internal forces or torques.\n\nEq.(7.28 b) is the rotational analogue of\n\nd\n\nd\n\nP\nF\n\nt\next= (7.17)\n\nNote that like Eq.(7.17), Eq.(7.28b) holds\n\ngood for any system of particles, whether it is a\n\nrigid body or its individual particles have all\n\nkinds of internal motion.\n\nConservation of angular momentum\n\nIf τττττ\next \n\n= 0, Eq. (7.28b) reduces to\n\nd\n0\n\ndt\n=\n\nL\n\nor         L = constant. (7.29a)\nThus, if the total external torque on a system\n\nof particles is zero, then the total angular\nmomentum of the system is conserved, i.e.\nremains constant. Eq. (7.29a) is equivalent to\nthree scalar equations,\n\nL\nx\n = K\n\n1\n, L\n\ny\n = K\n\n2\n and L\n\nz\n = K\n\n3\n(7.29 b)\n\nHere K\n1\n, K\n\n2\n and K\n\n3\n are constants; L\n\nx\n, L\n\ny\n and\n\nL\nz\n are the components of the total angular\n\nmomentum vector L along the x,y and z axes\nrespectively. The statement that the total\nangular momentum is conserved means that\neach of these three components is conserved.\n\nEq. (7.29a) is the rotational analogue of\nEq. (7.18a), i.e. the conservation law of the total\nlinear momentum for a system of  particles.\nLike Eq. (7.18a), it has applications in many\npractical situations. We shall look at a few of\nthe interesting applications later on in this\nchapter.\n\nExample 7.5  Find the torque of a force\n7î  + 3ĵ  – 5k̂  about the origin.

We want to calculate\nthe angular momentum of the particle about an\narbitrary point O.\n\nFig 7.19\n\nThe angular momentum is l = r × mv. Its\nmagnitude is mvr sinθ, where θ is the angle\nbetween r and v as shown in Fig. 7.19. Although\nthe particle changes position with time, the line\nof direction of v remains the same and hence\nOM = r sin θ. is a constant.\n\nFurther, the direction of l is perpendicular\nto the plane of r and v. It is into the page of the\nfigure.This direction does not change with time.\n\nThus, l remains the same in magnitude and\ndirection and is therefore conserved. Is there\nany external torque on the particle? \uf074\n\n7.8  EQUILIBRIUM OF A RIGID BODY\n\nWe are now going to concentrate on the motion\nof rigid bodies rather than on the motion of\ngeneral systems of particles.\n\nWe shall recapitulate what effect the\nexternal forces have on a rigid body. (Henceforth\nwe shall omit the adjective ‘external’ because\nunless stated otherwise, we shall deal with only\nexternal forces and torques.) The forces change\nthe translational state of the motion of the rigid\nbody, i.e. they change its total linear momentum\nin accordance with Eq. (7.17). But this is not\nthe only effect the forces have. The total torque\non the body may not vanish. Such a torque\nchanges the rotational state of motion of the\nrigid body, i.e. it changes the total angular\nmomentum of the body in accordance with Eq.\n(7.28 b).\n\nA rigid body is said to be in mechanical\nequilibrium, if both its linear momentum and\nangular momentum are not changing with time,\nor equivalently, the body has neither linear\n\nacceleration nor angular acceleration. This\nmeans\n(1) the total force, i.e. the vector sum of the\n\nforces, on the rigid body is zero;\n\nF F F F1 2\n1\n\n+ + + = =\n=\n∑... n i\ni\n\nn\n\n0 (7.30a)\n\nIf the total force on the body is zero, then\nthe total linear momentum of the body does\nnot change with time. Eq. (7.30a) gives the\ncondition for the translational equilibrium\nof the body.\n\n(2) The total torque, i.e. the vector sum of the\ntorques on the rigid body is zero,\n\nττ ττ ττ ττ1 2\n\n1\n\n+ + + = =\n=\n∑... n i\ni\n\nn\n\n0 (7.30b)\n\nIf the total torque on the rigid body is zero,\n\nthe total angular momentum of the body does\n\nnot change with time. Eq. (7.30 b) gives the\n\ncondition for the rotational equilibrium of the\n\nbody.\n\nOne may raise a question, whether the\n\nrotational equilibrium condition [Eq. 7.30(b)]\n\nremains valid, if the origin with respect to which\n\nthe torques are taken is shifted. One can show\n\nthat if the translational equilibrium condition\n\n[Eq. 7.30(a)] holds for a rigid body, then such a\n\nshift of origin does not matter, i.e. the rotational\n\nequilibrium condition is independent of the\n\nlocation of the origin about which the torques\n\nare taken. Example 7.7 gives a proof of this\n\nresult in a special case of a couple, i.e. two forces\n\nacting on a rigid body in translational\n\nequilibrium. The generalisation of this result to\n\nn forces is left as an exercise.\n\nEq. (7.30a) and Eq. (7.30b), both, are vector\n\nequations. They are equivalent to three scalar\n\nequations each. Eq. (7.30a) corresponds to\n\nFix\ni\n\nn\n\n=\n=\n∑ 0\n\n1\n, Fiy\n\ni\n\nn\n\n=\n=\n∑ 0\n\n1\n and Fiz\n\ni\n\nn\n\n=\n=\n∑ 0\n\n1\n  (7.31a)\n\nwhere F\nix\n, F\n\niy\n and F\n\niz\n are respectively the x, y\n\nand z components of the forces F\ni\n. Similarly,\n\nEq. (7.30b) is equivalent to three scalar\nequations\n\nτ\nix\n\ni\n\nn\n\n=\n=\n∑ 0\n\n1\n, τiy\n\ni\n\nn\n\n=\n=\n∑ 0\n\n1\n and τiz\n\ni\n\nn\n\n=\n=\n∑ 0\n\n1\n  (7.31b)\n\nwhere τ\nix\n, τ\n\niy\n  and  τ\n\niz \nare respectively the x, y and\n\nz components of the torque τττττ\ni\n .\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROTATIONAL MOTION 159\n\nEq. (7.31a) and (7.31b) give six independent\nconditions to be satisfied for mechanical\nequilibrium of a rigid body. In a number of\nproblems all the forces acting on the body are\ncoplanar. Then we need only three conditions\nto be satisfied for mechanical equilibrium. Two\nof these conditions correspond to translational\nequilibrium; the sum of the components of the\nforces along any two perpendicular axes in the\nplane must be zero. The third condition\ncorresponds to rotational equilibrium. The sum\nof the components of the torques along any axis\nperpendicular to the plane of the forces must\nbe zero.\n\nThe conditions of equilibrium of a rigid body\nmay be compared with those for a particle,\nwhich we considered in earlier chapters. Since\nconsideration of rotational motion does not\napply to a particle, only the conditions for\ntranslational equilibrium (Eq. 7.30 a) apply to\na particle. Thus, for equilibrium of a particle\nthe vector sum of all the forces on it must be\nzero. Since all these forces act on the single\nparticle, they must be concurrent. Equilibrium\nunder concurrent forces was discussed in the\nearlier chapters.\n\nA body may be in partial equilibrium, i.e., it\nmay be in translational equilibrium and not in\nrotational equilibrium, or it may be in rotational\nequilibrium and not in translational\nequilibrium.\n\nConsider a light (i.e. of negligible mass) rod\n(AB) as shown in Fig. 7.20(a). At the two ends (A\nand B) of which two parallel forces, both  equal\nin magnitude and acting along same direction\nare applied perpendicular to the rod.\n\nFig. 7.20 (a)\n\nLet C be the midpoint of AB, CA = CB = a.\nthe moment of the forces at A and B will both\nbe equal in magnitude (aF ), but opposite in\nsense as shown. The net moment on the rod will\nbe zero. The system will be in rotational\nequilibrium, but it will not be in translational\n\nequilibrium; F 0≠∑\n\nFig. 7.20 (b)\n\nThe force at B in Fig. 7.20(a) is reversed in\nFig. 7.20(b). Thus, we have the same rod with\ntwo forces of equal magnitude but acting in\nopposite diretions applied perpendicular to the\nrod, one at end A and the other at end B. Here\nthe moments of both the forces are equal, but\nthey are not opposite; they act in the same sense\nand cause anticlockwise rotation of the rod.  The\ntotal force on the body is zero; so the body is in\ntranslational equilibrium; but it is not in\nrotational equilibrium. Although the rod is not\nfixed in any way, it undergoes pure rotation (i.e.\nrotation without translation).\n\nA pair of forces of equal magnitude but acting\nin opposite directions with different lines of\naction is known as a couple or torque. A couple\nproduces rotation without translation.\n\nWhen we open the lid of a bottle by turning\nit, our fingers are applying a couple to the lid\n[Fig. 7.21(a)]. Another known example is a\ncompass needle in the earth’s magnetic field as\nshown in the Fig. 7.21(b). The earth’s magnetic\nfield exerts equal forces on the north and south\npoles. The force on the North Pole is towards\nthe north, and the force on the South Pole is\ntoward the south. Except when the needle points\nin the north-south direction; the two forces do\nnot have the same line of action. Thus there is\na couple acting on the needle due to the earth’s\nmagnetic field.\n\nFig. 7.21(a) Our fingers apply a couple to turn\nthe lid.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n160 PHYSICS\n\n\uf075\n\nFig. 7.21(b) The Earth’s magnetic field exerts equal\nand opposite forces on the poles of a\n\ncompass needle. These two  forces form\n\na couple.\n\nExample 7.7  Show that moment of a\ncouple does not depend on the point about\nwhich you take the moments.\n\nAnswer\n\nFig. 7.22\n\nConsider a couple as shown in Fig. 7.22\nacting on a rigid body. The forces F and -F act\nrespectively at points B and A. These points have\nposition vectors r\n\n1\n and r\n\n2\n with respect to origin\n\nO. Let us take the moments of the forces about\nthe origin.\n\nThe moment of the couple = sum of the\nmoments of the two forces making the couple\n\n= r\n1 \n× (–F) + r\n\n2 \n× F\n\n= r\n2 \n× F – r\n\n1 \n× F\n\n= (r\n2\n–r\n\n1\n)\n \n× F\n\nBut r\n1\n + AB = r\n\n2\n, and hence AB = r\n\n2\n – r\n\n1\n.\n\nThe moment of the couple, therefore, is\nAB\n\n \n× F.\nClearly this is independent of the origin, the\n\npoint about which we took the moments of the\nforces. \uf074\n\n7.8.1 Principle of moments\n\nAn ideal lever is essentially a light (i.e. of\nnegligible mass) rod pivoted at a point along its\n\nlength. This point is called the fulcrum. A see-\nsaw on the children’s playground is a typical\nexample of a lever. Two forces F\n\n1\n and F\n\n2\n, parallel\n\nto each other and usually perpendicular to the\nlever, as shown here, act on the lever at\ndistances d\n\n1\n and d\n\n2\n respectively from the\n\nfulcrum as shown in Fig. 7.23.\n\nFig. 7.23\n\nThe lever is a system in mechanical\nequilibrium. Let R be the reaction of the support\nat the fulcrum; R is directed opposite to the\nforces  F\n\n1\n and F\n\n2\n. For translational equilibrium,\n\nR – F\n1 \n– F\n\n2\n = 0 (i)\n\nFor considering rotational equilibrium we\ntake the moments about the fulcrum; the sum\nof moments must be zero,\n\nd\n1\nF\n\n1 \n– d\n\n2\nF\n\n2\n = 0 (ii)\n\nNormally the anticlockwise (clockwise)\nmoments are taken to be positive (negative). Note\nR acts at the fulcrum itself and has zero moment\nabout the fulcrum.\n\nIn the case of the lever force F\n1 \nis usually\n\nsome weight to be lifted. It is called the load\nand its distance from the fulcrum d\n\n1\n is called\n\nthe load arm. Force F\n2\n is the effort applied to lift\n\nthe load; distance d\n2\n of the effort from the\n\nfulcrum is the effort arm.\nEq. (ii) can be written as\nd\n\n1\nF\n\n1 \n=\n\n \nd\n\n2 \nF\n\n2\n(7.32a)\n\nor load arm\n \n× load = effort arm\n\n \n× effort\n\nThe above equation expresses the principle\nof moments for a lever. Incidentally the ratio\nF\n\n1\n/F\n\n2 \nis called the Mechanical Advantage (M.A.);\n\nM.A. =\n1 2\n\n2 1\n\nF d\n\nF d\n= (7.32b)\n\nIf the effort arm d\n2 \nis larger than the load\n\narm, the mechanical advantage is greater than\none. Mechanical advantage greater than one\nmeans that a small effort can be used to lift a\nlarge load. There are several examples of a lever\naround you besides the see-saw. The beam of a\nbalance is a lever. Try to find more such\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROTATIONAL MOTION 161\n\nexamples and identify the fulcrum, the effort and\neffort arm, and the load and the load arm of the\nlever in each case.\n\nYou may easily show that the principle of\nmoment holds even when the parallel forces  F\n\n1\n\nand F\n2 \nare not perpendicular, but act at some\n\nangle, to the lever.\n\n7.8.2 Centre of gravity\n\nMany of you may have the experience of\nbalancing your notebook on the tip of a finger.\nFigure 7.24 illustrates a similar experiment that\nyou can easily perform. Take an irregular-\nshaped cardboard having mass M and a narrow\ntipped object like a pencil. You can locate by trial\nand error a point G on the cardboard where it\ncan be balanced on the tip of the pencil. (The\ncardboard remains horizontal in this position.)\nThis point of balance is the centre of gravity (CG)\nof the cardboard. The tip of the pencil provides\na vertically upward force due to which the\ncardboard is in mechanical equilibrium. As\nshown in the Fig. 7.24, the reaction of the tip is\nequal and opposite to Mg and hence the\ncardboard is in translational equilibrium. It is\nalso in rotational equilibrium; if it were not so,\ndue to the unbalanced torque it would tilt and\nfall. There are torques on the card board due to\nthe forces of gravity like m\n\n1\ng, m\n\n2\ng ….  etc, acting\n\non the individual particles that make up the\ncardboard.\n\nFig. 7.24 Balancing a cardboard on the tip of a\npencil. The point of support, G, is the\n\ncentre of gravity.\n\nThe CG of the cardboard is so located that\nthe total torque on it due to the forces m\n\n1\ng, m\n\n2\ng\n\n….  etc. is zero.\nIf  r\n\ni\n is the position vector of the ith particle\n\nof an extended body with respect to its CG, then\nthe torque about the CG, due to the force of\ngravity on the particle  is τττττ\n\ni \n= r\n\ni\n × m\n\ni \ng. The total\n\ngravitational torque about the CG is zero, i.e.\n\nττ ττg i i i\nm= = × =∑ ∑ r g 0 (7.33)\n\nWe may therefore, define the CG of a body\nas that point where the total gravitational torque\non the body is zero.\n\nWe notice that in Eq. (7.33), g is the same\nfor all particles, and hence it comes out of the\nsummation. This gives, since g is non-zero,\n\n∑mi ir  = 0. Remember that the position vectors\n(r\n\ni\n) are taken with respect to the CG. Now, in\n\naccordance with the reasoning given below\nEq. (7.4a) in Sec. 7.2, if the sum is zero, the origin\nmust be the centre of mass of the body. Thus,\nthe centre of gravity of the body coincides with\nthe centre of mass in uniform gravity or gravity-\nfree space. We note that this is true because\nthe body being small,  g does not\n\nFig. 7.25 Determining the centre of gravity of a body\nof irregular shape. The centre of gravity G\n\nlies on the vertical AA\n1\n through the point\n\nof suspension of the body A.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n162 PHYSICS\n\n\uf075\n\n\uf075\n\nvary from one point of the body to the other. If\nthe body is so extended that g varies from part\nto part of the body, then the centre of gravity\nand centre of mass will not coincide. Basically,\nthe two are different concepts. The centre of\nmass has nothing to do with gravity. It depends\nonly on the distribution of mass of the body.\n\nIn Sec. 7.2 we found out the position of the\ncentre of mass of several regular, homogeneous\nobjects. Obviously the method used there gives\nus also the centre of gravity of these bodies, if\nthey are small enough.\n\nFigure 7.25 illustrates another way of\ndetermining the CG of an irregular shaped body\nlike a cardboard. If you suspend the body from\nsome point like A, the vertical line through A\npasses through the CG. We mark the vertical\nAA\n\n1\n. We then suspend the body through other\n\npoints like B and C. The intersection of the\nverticals gives the CG. Explain why the method\nworks. Since the body is small enough, the\nmethod allows us to determine also its centre\nof mass.\n\nExample 7.8   A metal bar 70 cm long\nand 4.00 kg in mass supported on two\nknife-edges placed 10 cm from each end.\nA 6.00 kg load is suspended at 30 cm from\none end.

The rod is uniform in cross\nsection and homogeneous; hence G is at the\ncentre of the rod; AB = 70 cm. AG = 35 cm, AP\n= 30 cm, PG = 5 cm, AK\n\n1\n= BK\n\n2 \n= 10 cm and K\n\n1\nG\n\n= K\n2\nG = 25 cm. Also, W= weight of the rod =\n\n4.00 kg and W\n1\n= suspended load = 6.00 kg;\n\nR\n1\n and R\n\n2\n are the normal reactions of the\n\nsupport at the knife edges.\nFor translational equilibrium of the rod,\nR\n\n1\n+R\n\n2 \n–W\n\n1 \n–W = 0 (i)\n\nNote W\n1\n and W act vertically down and R\n\n1\n\nand R\n2 \nact vertically up.\n\nFor considering rotational equilibrium, we\ntake moments of the forces. A convenient point\nto take moments about is G. The moments of\nR\n\n2\n and W\n\n1\n are anticlockwise (+ve), whereas the\n\nmoment of R\n1\n is clockwise (-ve).\n\nFor rotational equilibrium,\n–R\n\n1 \n(K\n\n1\nG) + W\n\n1 \n(PG) + R\n\n2 \n(K\n\n2\nG) = 0 (ii)\n\nIt is given that W = 4.00g N and W\n1\n = 6.00g\n\nN, where g = acceleration due to gravity. We\ntake g = 9.8 m/s2.\n\nWith numerical values inserted, from (i)\n\nR\n1 \n+ R\n\n2\n – 4.00g – 6.00g = 0\n\nor R\n1 \n+ R\n\n2\n = 10.00g  N (iii)\n\n               = 98.00 N\nFrom (ii), – 0.25 R\n\n1\n + 0.05 W\n\n1\n + 0.25 R\n\n2 \n= 0\n\nor R\n1\n – R\n\n2\n = 1.2g  N = 11.76 N (iv)\n\nFrom (iii) and (iv), R\n1\n = 54.88 N,\n\nR\n2\n = 43.12 N\n\nThus the reactions of the support are about\n55 N at K\n\n1 \nand 43 N at K\n\n2\n. \uf020\uf020\uf074\n\nExample 7.9  A 3m long ladder weighing\n20 kg leans on a frictionless wall.

We have yet to answer\n\none major question in this connection. What is\n\nthe analogue of mass in rotational motion?\n\nWe shall attempt to answer this question in the\n\npresent section. To keep the discussion simple,\n\nwe shall consider rotation about a fixed axis\n\nonly. Let us try to get an expression for the\n\nkinetic energy of a rotating body. We know\n\nthat for a body rotating about a fixed axis, each\n\nparticle of the body moves in a circle with linear\n\nvelocity given by Eq. (7.19). (Refer to Fig. 7.16).\n\nFor a particle at a distance from the axis, the\n\nlinear velocity is i irυ ω= . The kinetic energy of\nmotion of this particle is\n\n2 2 21 1\n\n2 2\ni i i i ik m m rυ ω= =\n\nwhere m\ni \nis the mass of the particle. The total\n\nkinetic energy K of the body is then given by\nthe sum of the kinetic energies of individual\nparticles,\n\n2 2\n\n1 1\n\n1\n( )\n\n2\n\nn n\n\ni i i\n\ni i\n\nK k m r ω\n= =\n\n= =\uf001 \uf001\nHere n is the number of particles in the body.\n\nNote ω is the same for all particles. Hence, taking\nω out of the sum,\n\n2 2\n\n1\n\n1\n( )\n\n2\n\nn\n\ni i\n\ni\n\nK m rω\n=\n\n= \uf001\n\nWe define a new parameter characterising\nthe rigid body, called the moment of inertia I ,\ngiven by\n\n2\n\n1\n\nn\n\ni i\n\ni\n\nI m r\n=\n\n=\uf001 (7.34)\nWith this definition,\n\n21\n\n2\nK Iω= (7.35)\n\nNote that the parameter I is independent of\nthe magnitude of the angular velocity. It is a\ncharacteristic of the rigid body and the axis\nabout which it rotates.\n\nCompare Eq. (7.35) for the kinetic energy of\na rotating body with the expression for the\nkinetic energy of a body in linear (translational)\nmotion,\n\n21\n\n2\nK m υ=\n\nHere, m is the mass of the body and v is its\nvelocity. We have already noted the analogy\nbetween angular velocity ω (in respect of rotational\nmotion about a fixed axis) and linear velocity v (in\nrespect of linear motion). It is then evident that\nthe parameter, moment of inertia I, is the desired\nrotational analogue of mass in linear motion. In\nrotation (about a fixed axis), the moment of inertia\nplays a similar role as mass does in linear motion.\n\nWe now apply the definition Eq. (7.34), to\ncalculate the moment of inertia in two simple\ncases.\n(a) Consider a thin ring of radius R and mass\n\nM, rotating in its own plane around its centre\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n164 PHYSICS\n\nwith angular velocity ω. Each mass element\nof the ring is at a distance R from the axis,\nand moves with a speed Rω.  The kinetic\nenergy is therefore,\n\n2 2 21 1\n\n2 2\nK M MRυ ω= =\n\nComparing with Eq. (7.35) we get I = MR 2\n\nfor the ring.\n\nFig. 7.28 A light rod of length l with a pair of masses\nrotating about an axis through the centre of\n\nmass of the system and perpendicular to\n\nthe rod. The total mass of the system is M.\n\n(b) Next, take a rigid rod of negligible mass of\nlength of length l with a pair of small masses,\nrotating about an axis through the centre of\nmass perpendicular to the rod (Fig. 7.28).\nEach mass M/2 is at a distance l/2 from the\naxis. The moment of inertia of the masses is\ntherefore given by\n\n(M/2) (l/2)2 + (M/2)(l/2)2\n\nThus, for the pair of masses, rotating about\nthe axis through the centre of mass\nperpendicular to the rod\n\nI = Ml2 / 4\nTable 7.1 simply gives the moment of inertia of\nvarious familiar regular shaped bodies about\nspecific axes. (The derivations of these\nexpressions are beyond the scope of this textbook\nand you will study them in higher classes.)\n\nAs the mass of a body resists a change in its\nstate of linear motion, it is a measure of its inertia\nin linear motion. Similarly, as the moment of\ninertia about a given axis of rotation resists a\nchange in its rotational motion, it can be\nregarded as a measure of rotational inertia of\nthe body; it is a measure of the way in which\ndifferent parts of the body are distributed at\ndifferent distances from the axis. Unlike the\nmass of a body, the moment of inertia is not a\nfixed quantity but depends on distribution of\nmass about the axis of rotation, and the\norientation and position of the axis of rotation\n\nwith respect to the body as a whole. As a\n\nmeasure of the way in which the mass of a\n\nrotating rigid body is distributed with respect to\n\nthe axis of rotation, we can define a new\n\nparameter, the radius of gyration. It is related\n\nto the moment of inertia and the total mass of\n\nthe body.\n\nNotice from the Table 7.1 that in all\n\ncases, we can write I = Mk2, where k has\n\nthe dimension of length. For a rod, about\n\nthe perpendicular axis at its midpoint,\n\ni.e.\n2 2\n\n12,k L=  = 12k L . Similarly, k = R/2\n\nfor the circular disc about its diameter. The\n\nlength k is a geometric property of the body and\n\naxis of rotation. It is called the radius of\n\ngyration. The radius of gyration of a body\n\nabout an axis may be defined as the distance\n\nfrom the axis of a mass point whose mass is\n\nequal to the mass of the whole body and whose\n\nmoment of inertia is equal to the moment of\n\ninertia of the body about the axis.\n\nThus, the moment of inertia of a rigid body\n\ndepends on the mass of the body, its shape and\n\nsize; distribution of mass about the axis of\n\nrotation, and the position and orientation of the\n\naxis of rotation.\n\nFrom the definition, Eq. (7.34), we can infer\n\nthat the dimensions of moments of inertia are\n\nML2 and its SI units are kg m2.\n\nThe property of this extremely important\n\nquantity I, as a measure of rotational inertia of\n\nthe body, has been put to a great practical use.\n\nThe machines, such as steam engine and the\n\nautomobile engine, etc., that produce rotational\n\nmotion have a disc with a large moment of\n\ninertia, called a flywheel. Because of its large\n\nmoment of inertia, the flywheel resists the\n\nsudden increase or decrease of the speed of the\n\nvehicle. It allows a gradual change in the speed\n\nand prevents jerky motions, thereby ensuring\n\na smooth ride for the passengers on the vehicle.\n\n7.10 THEOREMS OF PERPENDICULAR AND\nPARALLEL AXES\n\nThese are two useful theorems relating to\nmoment of inertia. We shall first discuss the\ntheorem of perpendicular axes and its simple\nyet instructive application in working out the\nmoments of inertia of some regular-shaped\nbodies.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROTATIONAL MOTION 165\n\nTable 7.1 Moments of inertia of some regular shaped bodies about specific axes\n\nZ Body Axis Figure I\n\n(1) Thin circular Perpendicular to M R 2\n\nring, radius R plane, at centre\n\n(2) Thin circular Diameter M R2/2\nring, radius R\n\n(3) Thin rod, Perpendicular to M L2/12\nlength  L rod, at mid point\n\n(4) Circular disc, Perpendicular to M R2/2\nradius R disc at centre\n\n(5) Circular disc, Diameter M R2/4\nradius R\n\n(6) Hollow cylinder, Axis of cylinder M R2\n\nradius R\n\n(7) Solid cylinder, Axis of cylinder M R2/2\nradius R\n\n(8) Solid sphere, Diameter 2 M R2/5\nradius R\n\nTheorem of perpendicular axes\n\nThis theorem is applicable to bodies which are\nplanar. In practice this means the theorem\n\napplies to flat bodies whose thickness is very\n\nsmall compared to their other dimensions (e.g.\n\nlength, breadth or radius). Fig. 7.29 illustrates\n\nthe theorem. It states that the moment of\ninertia of a planar body (lamina) about an axis\nperpendicular to its plane is equal to the sum\nof its moments of inertia about two\nperpendicular axes concurrent with\nperpendicular axis and lying in the plane of\nthe body.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n166 PHYSICS\n\n\uf075\n\nFig. 7.29 Theorem of perpendicular axes\napplicable to a planar body; x and y axes\n\nare two perpendicular axes in the plane\n\nand the z-axis is perpendicular to the\n\nplane.\n\nThe figure shows a planar body. An axis\nperpendicular to the body through a point O is\ntaken as the z-axis. Two mutually perpendicular\naxes lying in the plane of the body and\nconcurrent with z-axis, i.e., passing through O,\nare taken as the x and y-axes. The theorem\nstates that\n\nz x yI I I= + (7.36)\nLet us look at the usefulness of the theorem\n\nthrough an example.\n\nExample 7.10  What is the moment of\ninertia of a disc about one of its diameters?\n\nFig. 7.30 Moment of inertia of a disc about a\ndiameter, given its moment of inertia about\n\nthe perpendicular axis through its centre.\n\nAnswer  We assume the moment of inertia of\nthe disc about an axis perpendicular to it and\nthrough its centre to be known; it is MR2/2,\nwhere M is the mass of the disc and R is its\nradius (Table 7.1)\n\nThe disc can be considered to be a planar\nbody. Hence the theorem of perpendicular axes\nis applicable to it. As shown in Fig. 7.30, we\ntake three concurrent axes through the centre\nof the disc, O, as the x–, y– and z–axes; x– and\ny–axes lie in the plane of the disc and z–axis is\nperpendicular to it. By the theorem of\nperpendicular axes,\n\nz x yI I I= +\n\nNow, x and y axes are along two diameters\nof the disc, and by symmetry the moment of\ninertia of the disc is the same about any\ndiameter. Hence\n\nI\nx \n=\n\n \nI\ny\n\nand I\nz\n = 2I\n\nx\n\nBut I\nz\n = MR2/2\n\nSo finally, I\nx\n = I\n\nz\n/2 = MR2/4\n\nThus the moment of inertia of a disc about\nany of its diameter is MR2/4 . \uf020\uf020\uf074\n\nFind similarly the moment of inertia of a\nring about any of its diameters. Will the theorem\nbe applicable to a solid cylinder?\n\nFig.7.31 The theorem of parallel axes The z and z′\naxes are two parallel axes separated  by a\ndistance a; O is the centre of mass of the\n\nbody, OO’ = a.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROTATIONAL MOTION 167\n\n\uf075\n\n\uf075\n\n7.10.1 Theorem of parallel axes\n\nThis theorem is applicable to a body of any\nshape. It allows to find the moment of inertia of\na body about any axis, given the moment of\ninertia of the body about a parallel axis through\nthe centre of mass of the body. We shall only\nstate this theorem and not give its proof. We\nshall, however, apply it to a few simple situations\nwhich will be enough to convince us about the\nusefulness of the theorem. The theorem may\nbe stated as follows:\n\nThe moment of inertia of a body about any\naxis is equal to the sum of the moment of\ninertia of the body about a parallel axis passing\nthrough its centre of mass and the product of\nits mass and the square of the distance\nbetween the two parallel axes. As shown in\nthe Fig. 7.31, z and z′ are two parallel axes,\nseparated by a distance a. The z-axis passes\nthrough the centre of mass O of the rigid body.\nThen according to the theorem of parallel axes\n\nI\nz′\n\n = I\nz \n+ Ma2 (7.37)\n\nwhere I\nz\n  and  I\n\nz′\n are the moments of inertia of the\n\nbody about the z and z′ axes respectively, M is the\ntotal mass of the body and a is the perpendicular\ndistance between the two parallel axes.\n\nExample 7.11  What is the moment of\ninertia of a rod of mass M, length l about\nan axis perpendicular to it through one\nend?\n\nAnswer    For the rod of mass M and length l,\nI = Ml2/12.

For\n\nexample, the angular velocity ωωωωω plays the same\nrole in rotation as the linear velocity v in\ntranslation. We wish to take this analogy\n\nfurther. In doing so we shall restrict the\ndiscussion only to rotation about fixed axis. This\n\ncase of motion involves only one degree of\nfreedom, i.e., needs only one independent\nvariable to describe the motion. This in\n\ntranslation corresponds to linear motion. This\nsection is limited only to kinematics. We shall\n\nturn to dynamics in later sections.\n\nWe recall that for specifying the angular\ndisplacement of the rotating body we take any\nparticle like P (Fig.7.33) of the body. Its angular\ndisplacement θ in the plane it moves is the\nangular displacement of the whole body; θ is\nmeasured from a fixed direction in the plane of\n\nmotion of P, which we take to be the x′-axis,\nchosen parallel to the x-axis. Note, as shown,\nthe axis of rotation is the z – axis and the plane\nof the motion of the particle is the x - y plane.\nFig. 7.33 also shows θ\n\n0\n, the angular\n\ndisplacement at t = 0.\n\nWe also recall that the angular velocity is\nthe time rate of change of angular displacement,\nω = dθ/dt. Note since the axis of rotation is fixed,\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n168 PHYSICS\n\n\uf075\n\n\uf075\nthere is no need to treat angular velocity as a\n\nvector. Further, the angular acceleration, α =\ndω/dt.\n\nThe kinematical quantities in rotational\nmotion, angular displacement (θ), angular\nvelocity (ω) and angular acceleration (α)\nrespectively are analogous to kinematic\nquantities in linear motion, displacement (x ),\nvelocity (v) and acceleration (a). We know the\nkinematical equations of linear motion with\nuniform (i.e. constant) acceleration:\n\nv = v\n0\n + at (a)\n\n2\n0 0\n\n1\n\n2\nx x t atυ= + + (b)\n\n2 2\n0 2axυ υ= + (c)\n\nwhere x\n0\n = initial displacement and v\n\n0\n= initial\n\nvelocity. The word ‘initial’ refers to values of the\nquantities at t = 0\n\nThe corresponding kinematic equations for\nrotational motion with uniform angular\nacceleration are:\n\n0 t= +ω ω α (7.38)\n\n2\n0 0\n\n1\n\n2\nt t= + +θ θ ω α (7.39)\n\nand 2 2\n0 02 ( – )= +ω ω α θ θ (7.40)\n\nwhere θ\n0\n= initial angular displacement of the\n\nrotating body, and ω\n0 \n= initial angular velocity\n\nof the body.\n\nFig.7.33 Specifying the angular position of a rigid\n\nbody.\n\nExample 7.13  Obtain Eq. (7.38) from first\nprinciples.\n\nAnswer   The angular acceleration is uniform,\nhence\n\nd\n\nd\nconstant\n\nt\n\nω\nα= = (i)\n\nIntegrating this equation,\n\nω α= +∫ dt c\n   (as is constant)t cα α= +\nAt t = 0,  ω = ω\n\n0 \n(given)\n\nFrom (i) we get at t = 0, ω = c = ω\n0\n\nThus, ω = αt + ω\n0 \n as required.\n\nWith the definition of ω = dθ/dt we may\nintegrate Eq. (7.38) to get Eq. (7.39). This\nderivation and the derivation of Eq.

Also, we know that in rotational\nmotion moment of inertia and torque play the\nsame role as mass and force respectively in\nlinear motion. Given this we should be able to\nguess what the other analogues indicated in the\ntable are. For example, we know that in linear\nmotion, work done is given by F dx, in rotational\n\nmotion about a fixed axis it should be dτ θ ,\nsince we already know the correspondence\n\nd dx θ→  and F τ→ . It is, however, necessary\nthat these correspondences are established on\nsound dynamical considerations. This is what\nwe now turn to.\n\nBefore we begin, we note a simplification\nthat arises in the case of rotational motion\nabout a fixed axis. Since the axis is fixed, only\nthose components of torques, which are along\nthe direction of the fixed axis need to be\nconsidered in our discussion. Only these\ncomponents can cause the body to rotate about\nthe axis. A component of the torque\nperpendicular to the axis of rotation will tend\nto turn the axis from its position. We specifically\nassume that there will arise necessary forces of\nconstraint to cancel the effect of the\nperpendicular components of the (external)\ntorques, so that the fixed position of the axis\nwill be maintained. The perpendicular\ncomponents of the torques, therefore need not\nbe taken into account. This means that for our\ncalculation of torques on a rigid body:\n\n(1) We need to consider only those forces that\nlie in planes perpendicular to the axis.\nForces which are parallel to the axis will\ngive torques perpendicular to the axis and\nneed not be taken into account.\n\n(2) We need to consider only those components\nof the position vectors which are\nperpendicular to the axis. Components of\nposition vectors along the axis will result in\ntorques perpendicular to the axis and need\nnot be taken into account.\n\nWork done by a torque\n\nFig. 7.34 Work done by a force F\n1 \nacting on a particle\n\nof a body rotating about a fixed axis; the\n\nparticle describes a circular path with\n\ncentre C on the axis;  arc P\n1\nP′\n\n1\n(ds\n\n1\n) gives\n\nthe displacement of the particle.\n\nFigure 7.34 shows a cross-section of a rigid\nbody rotating about a fixed axis, which is taken\nas the z-axis (perpendicular to the plane of the\npage; see Fig. 7.33). As said above we need to\nconsider only those forces which lie in planes\nperpendicular to the axis. Let F\n\n1\n be one such\n\ntypical force acting as shown on a particle of\nthe body at point P\n\n1\n with its line of action in a\n\nplane perpendicular to the axis. For convenience\nwe call  this to be the x′–y′ plane (coincident\nwith the plane of the page). The particle at P\n\n1\n\ndescribes a circular path of radius r\n1\n with centre\n\nC on the axis; CP\n1\n = r\n\n1\n.\n\nIn time ∆t, the point moves to the position\nP\n\n1\n′. The displacement of the particle ds\n\n1\n,\n\ntherefore, has magnitude ds\n1\n = r\n\n1\ndθ and\n\ndirection tangential at P\n1\n to the circular path\n\nas shown. Here dθ is the angular displacement\nof the particle, dθ = 1 1P CP∠ ′ .The work done by\nthe force on the particle is\n\ndW\n1\n = F\n\n1\n. ds\n\n1\n= F\n\n1\nds\n\n1\n cosφ\n\n1\n= F\n\n1\n(r\n\n1 \ndθ)sinα\n\n1\n\nwhere φ\n1\n is the angle between F\n\n1\n and the tangent\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n170 PHYSICS\n\nat P\n1,\n and α\n\n1\n is the angle between  F\n\n1 \nand the\n\nradius vector OP\n1\n; φ\n\n1\n + α\n\n1\n = 90°.\n\nThe torque due to F\n1 \n\nabout the origin is\nOP\n\n1 \n× F\n\n1\n. Now OP\n\n1\n = OC + OP\n\n1\n. [Refer to\n\nFig. 7.17(b).] Since OC is along the axis, the\ntorque resulting from it is excluded from our\nconsideration. The effective torque due to F\n\n1\n is\n\nτττττ\n1\n= CP × F\n\n1\n; it is directed along the axis of rotation\n\nand has a magnitude τ\n1\n= r\n\n1\nF\n\n1 \nsinα , Therefore,\n\ndW\n1\n = τ\n\n1\ndθ\n\nIf there are more than one forces acting on\nthe body, the work done by all of them can be\nadded to give the total work done on the body.\nDenoting the magnitudes of the torques due to\nthe different forces as τ\n\n1\n, τ\n\n2\n, …  etc,\n\n1 2d ( ...)dW τ τ θ= + +\n\nRemember, the forces giving rise to the\ntorques act on different particles, but the\n\nangular displacement dθ is the same for all\nparticles. Since all the torques considered are\nparallel to the fixed axis, the magnitude τ of the\ntotal torque is just the algebraic sum of the\nmagnitudes of the torques, i.e., τ = τ\n\n1 \n+ τ\n\n2\n + .....\n\nWe, therefore, have\n\nd dW τ θ= (7.41)\n\nThis expression gives the work done by the\ntotal (external) torque τ which acts on the body\nrotating about a fixed axis. Its similarity with\nthe corresponding expression\n\ndW= F ds\nfor linear (translational) motion is obvious.\n\nDividing both sides of Eq. (7.41) by dt gives\n\nd d\n\nd d\n\nW\nP\n\nt t\n\nθ\nτ τω= = =\n\nor P τω= (7.42)\nThis is the instantaneous power. Compare\n\nthis expression for power in the case of\nrotational motion about a fixed axis with that of\npower in the case of linear motion,\n\nP = Fv\n\nIn a perfectly rigid body there is no internal\nmotion. The work done by external torques is\ntherefore, not dissipated and goes on to increase\nthe kinetic energy of the body. The rate at which\nwork is done on the body is given by Eq. (7.42).\nThis is to be equated to the rate at which kinetic\nenergy increases.

We already\nknow from there that the time rate of total\nangular momentum of a system of particles\nabout a point is equal to the total external torque\non the system taken about the same point. When\nthe total external torque is zero, the total angular\nmomentum of the system is conserved.\n\nWe now wish to study the angular momentum\nin the special case of rotation about a fixed axis.\nThe general expression for the total angular\nmomentum of the system of n particles is\n\nL r p= ×\n=\n∑ i i\ni\n\nN\n\n1\n(7.25b)\n\nWe first consider the angular momentum of\na typical particle of the rotating rigid body. We\nthen sum up the contributions of individual\nparticles to get L of the whole body.\n\nFor a typical particle l = r × p. As seen in the\nlast section r = OP = OC + CP [Fig. 7.17(b)]. With\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n172 PHYSICS\n\np = m v ,\n\n( ) ( )= × + ×OC v CP vm ml\nThe magnitude of the linear velocity v of the\nparticle at P is given by v = ωr\n\n⊥\n where r\n\n⊥\n is the\n\nlength of CP or the perpendicular distance of P\nfrom the axis of rotation. Further, v is tangential\nat P to the circle which the particle describes.\nUsing the right-hand rule one can check that\nCP × v is parallel to the fixed axis. The unit\nvector along the fixed axis (chosen as the z-axis)\n\nis k̂ . Hence\n\n( ) ˆ⊥× =CP v km r mv\n= 2 ˆ ω⊥ kmr (since υ = ωr⊥ )\nSimilarly, we can check that OC × v is\n\nperpendicular to the fixed axis. Let us denote\nthe part of  l along the fixed axis (i.e. the z-axis)\nby l\n\nz\n, then\n\n z = ×CP vml = \n2 ˆω⊥ kmr\n\nand = + ×OC vz ml l\nWe note that l\n\nz\n is parallel to the fixed axis,\n\nbut l is not. In general, for a particle, the angular\nmomentum l is not along the axis of rotation,\ni.e. for a particle, l and ωωωωω are not necessarily\nparallel. Compare this with the corresponding\nfact in translation. For a particle, p and v are\nalways parallel to each other.\n\nFor computing the total angular momentum\nof the whole rigid body, we add up the\ncontribution of each particle of the body.\n\nThus\n\nWe denote by ⊥L  and zL  the components of\n\nL  respectively perpendicular to the z-axis and\n\nalong the z-axis;\n\nL OC v⊥ = ×∑ i i im (7.44a)\nwhere m\n\ni\n and v\n\ni\n are respectively the mass and\n\nthe velocity of the ith particle and C\ni\n is the centre\n\nof the circle described by the particle;\n\nand\n\nor ˆω=L kz I (7.44b)\nThe last step follows since the perpendicular\n\ndistance of the ith particle from the axis is r\ni\n;\n\nand by definition the moment of inertia of the\n\nbody about the axis of rotation is I m ri i= ∑ 2 .\n\nNote z ⊥= +L L L (7.44c)\nThe rigid bodies which we have mainly\n\nconsidered in this chapter are symmetric about\nthe axis of rotation, i.e. the axis of rotation is\none of their symmetry axes. For such bodies,\nfor a given OC\n\ni\n, for every particle which has a\n\nvelocity v\ni\n , there is another particle of velocity\n\n–v\ni\n  located diametrically opposite on the circle\n\nwith centre C\ni\n described by the particle. Together\n\nsuch pairs will contribute zero to ⊥L  and as a\n\nresult for symmetric bodies ⊥L  is zero, and\n\nhence\n\nˆω= =L L kz I (7.44d)\nFor bodies, which are not symmetric about\n\nthe axis of rotation, L is not equal to L\nz\n and\n\nhence L does not lie along the axis of rotation.\nReferring to Table 7.1, can you tell in which\n\ncases L = L\nz \nwill not apply?\n\nLet us differentiate Eq. (7.44b). Since k̂ is a\n\nfixed (constant) vector, we get\n\nd\n\nd\n\nd\n\nd\nz\n\nt t\nIL k( ) = ( )\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\nω\nˆ\n\nNow, Eq. (7.28b) states\n\nd\n\ndt\n=\n\nL\nττττ\n\nAs we have seen in the last section, only\nthose components of the external torques which\nare along the axis of rotation, need to be taken\ninto account, when we discuss rotation about a\n\nfixed axis. This means we can take ˆτ= kττττ .\n\nSince z ⊥= +L L L  and the direction of Lz (vector\n\nk̂ ) is fixed, it follows that for rotation about a\n\nfixed axis,\n\nd ˆ\nd\n\nτ=\nL\n\nkz\nt\n\n(7.45a)\n\nand \nd\n\n0\ndt\n\n⊥ =\nL\n\n(7.45b)\n\nThus, for rotation about a fixed axis, the\ncomponent of angular momentum\nperpendicular to the fixed axis is constant. As\n\nˆω=L kz I , we get from Eq. (7.45a),\n\n( )\nd\n\nd\nI\n\nt\nω τ= (7.45c)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROTATIONAL MOTION 173\n\nIf the moment of inertia I does not change with\ntime,\n\n( )d d\nd d\n\nI I I\nt t\n\nω\nω α= =\n\nand we get from Eq. (7.45c),\n\nIτ α= (7.43)\nWe have already derived this equation using\n\nthe work - kinetic energy route.\n\n7.13.1 Conservation of angular momentum\n\nWe are now in a position to revisit the principle\nof conservation of angular momentum in the\ncontext of rotation about a fixed axis. From Eq.\n(7.45c), if the external torque is zero,\n\nL\nz\n = Iω = constant (7.46)\n\nFor symmetric bodies, from Eq. (7.44d), L\nz\n\nmay be replaced by L .(L and L\nz \n are respectively\n\nthe magnitudes of L and L\nz\n.)\n\nThis then is the required form, for fixed axis\nrotation, of Eq. (7.29a), which expresses the\ngeneral law of conservation of angular\nmomentum of a system of particles.  Eq. (7.46)\napplies to many situations that we come across\nin daily life.  You may do this experiment with\nyour friend.  Sit on a swivel chair (a chair with a\nseat, free to rotate about a pivot) with your arms\nfolded and feet not resting on, i.e., away from,\nthe ground.  Ask your friend to rotate the chair\nrapidly. While the chair is rotating with\n\nconsiderable angular speed stretch your arms\nhorizontally.  What happens?  Your angular\nspeed is reduced.  If you bring back your arms\ncloser to your body, the angular speed increases\nagain.  This is a situation where the principle of\nconservation of angular momentum is\napplicable.  If friction in the rotational\nmechanism is neglected, there is no external\ntorque about the axis of rotation of the chair\nand hence Iω is constant.  Stretching the arms\nincreases I about the axis of rotation, resulting\nin decreasing the angular speed ω.  Bringing\nthe arms closer to the body has the opposite\neffect.\n\nA circus acrobat and a diver take advantage\nof this principle.  Also, skaters and classical,\nIndian or western, dancers performing a\npirouette (a spinning about a tip–top) on the toes\nof one foot display ‘mastery’ over this principle.\nCan you explain?\n\n7.14  ROLLING MOTION\n\nOne of the most common motions observed in\ndaily life is the rolling motion.  All wheels used\nin transportation have rolling motion.  For\nspecificness we shall begin with the case of a\ndisc, but the result will apply to any rolling body\nrolling on a level surface.  We shall assume that\nthe disc rolls without slipping.  This means that\nat any instant of time the bottom of the disc\n\nFig 7.36 (a) A demonstration of conservation of\nangular momentum. A girl sits  on a\n\nswivel chair and stretches her arms/\n\nbrings her arms closer to the body.\n\nFig 7.36 (b) An acrobat employing the principle of\nconservation of angular momentum in\n\nher performance.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n174 PHYSICS\n\nwhich is in contact with the surface is at rest\non the surface.\n\nWe have remarked earlier that rolling motion\nis a combination of rotation and translation.  We\nknow that the translational motion of a system\nof particles is the motion of its centre of mass.\n\nFig. 7.37 The rolling motion (without slipping) of a\ndisc on a level surface. Note at any instant,\n\nthe point of contact P\n0\n of the disc with the\n\nsurface is at rest; the centre of mass of\n\nthe disc moves with velocity, v\ncm\n\n. The disc\n\nrotates with angular velocity ω about its\naxis which passes through C; v\n\ncm\n =Rω,\n\nwhere R is the radius of the disc.\n\nLet v\ncm\n\n be the velocity of the centre of mass\n\nand therefore the translational velocity of the\n\ndisc. Since the centre of mass of the rolling disc\n\nis at its geometric centre C (Fig. 7. 37), v\ncm \n\nis\n\nthe velocity of C.  It is parallel to the level\n\nsurface.  The rotational motion of the disc is\n\nabout its symmetry axis, which passes through\n\nC.  Thus, the velocity of any point of the disc,\n\nlike P\n0\n, P\n\n1\n or P\n\n2\n, consists of two parts, one is the\n\ntranslational velocity v\ncm \n\nand the other is the\n\nlinear velocity v\nr \non account of rotation. The\n\nmagnitude of  v\nr\n is v\n\nr \n= rω, where ω is the angular\n\nvelocity of the rotation of the disc about the axis\n\nand r is the distance of the point from the axis\n\n(i.e. from C).  The velocity v\nr \nis directed\n\nperpendicular to the radius vector of the given\n\npoint with respect to C.  In Fig. 7.37, the velocity\n\nof the point P\n2\n (v\n\n2\n) and its components \n\n \nv\n\nr \nand\n\nv\ncm \n\nare shown;  v\nr \nhere is perpendicular to CP\n\n2 \n.\n\nIt is easy to show that v\nz\n is perpendicular to the\n\nline P\nO\nP\n\n2\n. Therefore the line passing through P\n\nO\n\nand parallel to ωωωωω is called the instantaneous axis\nof rotation.\n\nAt P\no\n, the linear velocity, v\n\nr\n, due to rotation\n\nis directed exactly opposite to the translational\n\nvelocity v\ncm\n\n.\n \nFurther the magnitude of  v\n\nr \nhere is\n\nRω, where R is the radius of the disc. The\ncondition that P\n\no \nis instantaneously at rest\n\nrequires v\ncm  \n\n= Rω. Thus for the disc the condition\nfor rolling without slipping is\n\nυ ω\ncm\n\nR= (7.47)\nIncidentally, this means that the velocity of\n\npoint P\n1\n at the top of the disc (v\n\n1\n) has a\n\nmagnitude v\ncm\n\n+ Rω or 2 v\ncm \n\nand is directed\n\nparallel to the level surface. The condition (7.47)\n\napplies to all rolling bodies.\n\n7.14.1 Kinetic Energy of Rolling Motion\n\nOur next task will be to obtain an expression\nfor the kinetic energy of a rolling body. The\nkinetic energy of a rolling body can be separated\ninto kinetic energy of translation and kinetic\nenergy of rotation. This is a special case of a\ngeneral result for a system of particles,\naccording to which the kinetic energy of a\nsystem of particles (K) can be separated into\nthe kinetic energy of translational motion of the\ncentre of mass (MV2/2) and kinetic energy of\nrotational motion about the centre of mass of\nthe system of particles (K′). Thus,\n\n(7.48)\nWe assume  this general result (see Exercise\n\n7.31), and apply it to the case of rolling motion.\n\nIn our notation, the kinetic energy of the centre\nof mass, i.e., the kinetic energy of translation,\n\nof the rolling body is mv2\ncm\n\n /2, where m is the\nmass of the body and v\n\ncm\n is the centre of the\n\nmass velocity. Since the motion of the rolling\n\nbody about the centre of mass is rotation, K′\nrepresents the kinetic energy of rotation of the\n\nbody; , where I is the moment of\ninertia about the appropriate axis, which is the\n\nsymmetry axis of the rolling body. The kinetic\nenergy of  a rolling body, therefore, is given by\n\n(7.49a)\n\nSubstituting I = mk2 where k = the\ncorresponding radius of gyration of the body\nand v\n\ncm\n= R ω, we get\n\nor  (7.49b)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROTATIONAL MOTION 175\n\n\uf075\n\nEquation (7.49b) applies to any rolling body:\na disc, a cylinder, a ring or a sphere.\n\nExample 7.16  Three bodies, a ring, a solid\ncylinder and a solid sphere roll down the\nsame inclined plane without slipping.  They\nstart from rest.  The radii of the bodies are\nidentical.  Which of the bodies reaches the\nground with maximum velocity?\n\nAnswer  We assume conservation of energy of\nthe rolling body, i.e. there is no loss of energy\ndue to friction etc. The potential energy lost by\nthe body in rolling down the inclined plane\n(= mgh) must, therefore, be equal to kinetic\nenergy gained.  (See Fig.7.38) Since the bodies\nstart from rest the kinetic energy gained is equal\nto the final kinetic energy of the bodies.  From\n\nEq.

Which\nbody has the greatest rotational kinetic energy while\nreaching the bottom of the inclined plane? \uf074\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. Ideally, a rigid body is one for which the distances between different particles of the\nbody do not change, even though there are forces on them.\n\n2. A rigid body fixed at one point or along a line can have only rotational motion. A rigid\nbody not fixed in some way can have either pure translational motion or a combination\nof translational and rotational motions.\n\n3. In rotation about a fixed axis, every particle of the rigid body moves in a circle which\nlies in a plane perpendicular to the axis and has its centre on the axis. Every Point in\nthe rotating rigid body has the same angular velocity at any instant of time.\n\n4. In pure translation, every particle of the body moves with the same velocity at any\ninstant of time.\n\n5. Angular velocity is a vector. Its magnitude is ω = dθ/dt and it is directed along the axis\nof rotation. For rotation about a fixed axis, this vector ωωωωω has a fixed direction.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n176 PHYSICS\n\n6. The vector or cross product of two vector a and b is a vector written as a×b. The\nmagnitude of this vector is absinθ  and its direction is given by the right handed screw\nor the right hand rule.\n\n7. The linear velocity of a particle of a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis is given by\nv = ωωωωω × r, where r is the position vector of the particle with respect to an origin along\nthe fixed axis. The relation applies even to more general rotation of a rigid body with\none point fixed. In that case r is the position vector of the particle with respect to the\nfixed point taken as the origin.\n\n8. The centre of mass of a system of n particles is defined as the point whose position\nvector is\n\nR\nr\n\n=\n∑m\n\nM\n\ni i\n\n9. Velocity of the centre of mass of a system of particles is given by V = P/M, where P is the\nlinear momentum of the system. The centre of mass moves as if all the mass of the\nsystem is concentrated at this point and all the external forces act at it. If the total\nexternal force on the system is zero, then the total linear momentum of the system is\nconstant.\n\n10. The angular momentum of a system of n particles about the origin is\n\nL r p  \n  \n\n= ×\n=\n∑ i\n\ni\n\nn\n\ni\n\n1\n\nThe torque or moment of force on a system of n particles about the origin is\n\nττ = ×∑ r Fi i\n1\n\nThe force  F\ni  \nacting on the ith particle includes the external as well as internal forces.\n\nAssuming Newton’s third law of motion and that forces between any two particles act\nalong the line joining the particles, we can show τττττ\n\nint\n = 0 and\n\nd\n\ndt\next\n\nL\n= ττ\n\n11. A rigid body is in mechanical equilibrium if\n\n(1) it is in translational equilibrium, i.e., the total external force on it is zero : F 0i =∑ ,\nand\n\n(2) it is in rotational equilibrium, i.e. the total external torque on it is zero :\n\nττi i i= × =∑ ∑ r F 0 .\n12. The centre of gravity of an extended body is that point where the total gravitational\n\ntorque on the body is zero.\n\n13. The moment of intertia of a rigid body about an axis is defined by the formula  I m ri i= ∑ 2\nwhere r\n\ni\n is the perpendicular distance of the ith point of the body from the axis. The\n\nkinetic energy of rotation is \n21\n\n2\nK Iω= .\n\n14. The theorem of parallel axes: 2\nz zI I Ma′ = + , allows us to determine the moment of\n\nintertia of a rigid body about an axis as the sum of the moment of inertia of the body\nabout a parallel axis through its centre of mass and the product of mass and square of\nthe perpendicular distance between these two axes.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROTATIONAL MOTION 177\n\n15. Rotation about a fixed axis is directly analogous to linear motion in respect of kinematics\nand dynamics.\n\n16. For a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis (say, z-axis) of rotation, L\nz\n = Iω, where I is\n\nthe moment of inertia about z-axis. In general, the angular momentum L for such a\nbody is not along the axis of rotation. Only if the body is symmetric about the axis of\n\nrotation, L is along the axis of rotation. In that case, zL I= =L ω . The angular\nacceleration of a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis is given by Iα = τ. If the external\ntorque τ acting on the body is zero, the component of angular momentum about the\nfixed axis (say, z-axis), L\n\nz\n (=Iω) of such a rotating body is constant.\n\n17. For rolling motion without slipping v\ncm\n\n = Rω, where v\ncm\n\n  is the velocity of translation (i.e.\nof the centre of mass), R is the radius and m is the mass of the body. The kinetic energy\nof such a rolling body is the sum of kinetic energies of translation and rotation:\n\n2 21 1\n\n2 2\ncmK m v I= + ω .\n\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n\n1. To determine the motion of the centre of mass of a system no knowledge of internal\nforces of the system is required. For this purpose we need to know only the external\nforces on the body.\n\n2. Separating the motion of a system of particles as the motion of the centre of mass, (i.e.,\nthe translational motion of the system) and motion about (i.e. relative to) the centre of\nmass of the system is a useful technique in dynamics of a system of particles. One\nexample of this technique is separating the kinetic energy of a system of particles K as\nthe kinetic energy of the system about its centre of mass K′ and the kinetic energy of\nthe centre of mass MV2/2,\n\n      K = K′ + MV2/2\n3. Newton’s Second Law for finite sized bodies (or systems of particles) is based in  Newton’s\n\nSecond Law and also Newton’s Third Law for particles.\n4. To establish that the time rate of change of the total angular momentum of a system of\n\nparticles is the total external torque in the system, we need not only Newton’s second\nlaw for particles, but also Newton’s third law with the provision that the forces between\nany two particles act along the line joining the particles.\n\n5. The vanishing of the total external force and the vanishing of the total external torque\nare independent conditions. We can have one without the other. In a couple, total\nexternal force is zero, but total torque is non-zero.\n\n6. The total torque on a  system is independent of the origin if the total external force is\nzero.\n\n7. The centre of gravity of a body coincides with its centre of mass only if the gravitational\nfield does not vary from one part of the body to the other.\n\n8. The angular momentum L and the angular velocity ωωωωω are not necessarily parallel vectors.\nHowever, for the simpler situations discussed in this chapter when rotation is about a\nfixed axis which is an axis of symmetry of the rigid body, the relation L = Iωωωωω holds good,\nwhere I is the moment of the inertia of the body about the rotation axis.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n178 PHYSICS\n\nEXERCISES\n\n7.1 Give the location of the centre of mass of a (i) sphere, (ii) cylinder, (iii) ring, and (iv)\ncube, each of uniform mass density.

According to the new definition,\nPluto is no longer a planet. This means that the Solar System consists of\neight planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and\nNeptune. According to the IAU usage, the ‘planet’ and ‘other bodies’ in our\nSolar System, except satellites, are to be defined into three distinct categories\nof celestial objects in the following way:\n\n1. A ‘planet’ is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has\nsufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it\nassumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and (c) has\ncleared the neighbourhood around its orbit.\n\n2. A ‘dwarf planet’ is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun,\n(b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so\nthat it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, (c) has\nnot cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit, and (d) is not a satellite.\n\n3. All ‘other objects’, except satellites, orbiting the Sun, shall be referred to\ncollectively as ‘Small Solar-System Bodies’.\n\nUnlike other eight planets in the Solar System, Pluto’s orbital path overlaps\nwith ‘other objects’ and the planet Neptune. The ‘other objects’ currently\ninclude most of the Solar System asteroids, most of the Trans-Neptunian\nObjects (TNOs), comets, and other small bodies.\n\nPluto is a ‘dwarf planet’ by the above definition and is recognised as the\nprototype of a new category of Trans-Neptunian Objects.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n\n')('status', 200)
