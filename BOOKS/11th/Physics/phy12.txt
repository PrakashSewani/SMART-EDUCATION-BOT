In this chapter we shall study laws that govern\nthermal energy. We shall study the processes where work is\nconverted into heat and vice versa. In winter, when we rub\nour palms together, we feel warmer; here work done in rubbing\nproduces the  ‘heat’.  Conversely, in a steam engine, the ‘heat’\nof the steam is used to do useful work in moving the pistons,\nwhich in turn rotate the wheels of the train.\n\nIn physics, we need to define the notions of heat,\ntemperature, work, etc. more carefully.  Historically, it took a\nlong time to arrive at the proper concept of ‘heat’. Before the\nmodern picture, heat was regarded as a fine invisible fluid\nfilling in the pores of a substance.  On contact between a hot\nbody and a cold body, the fluid  (called caloric) flowed from\nthe colder to the hotter body ! This is similar to what happens\nwhen a horizontal pipe connects two tanks containing water\nup to different heights. The flow continues until the levels of\nwater in the two tanks are the same.  Likewise, in the ‘caloric’\npicture of heat, heat flows until the ‘caloric levels’ (i.e., the\ntemperatures) equalise.\n\nIn time, the picture of heat as a fluid was discarded in\nfavour of the modern concept of heat as a form of energy. An\nimportant experiment in this connection was due to Benjamin\nThomson (also known as Count Rumford) in 1798. He\nobserved that boring of a brass cannon generated a lot of\nheat, indeed enough to boil water. More significantly, the\namount of heat produced depended on the work done (by the\nhorses employed for turning the drill) but not on the\nsharpness of the drill. In the caloric picture, a sharper drill\nwould scoop out more heat fluid from the pores; but this\nwas not observed. A most natural explanation of the\nobservations was that heat was a form of energy and the\nexperiment demonstrated conversion of energy from one form\nto another–from work to heat.\n\n12.1 Introduction\n\n12.2 Thermal equilibrium\n\n12.3 Zeroth law of\nThermodynamics\n\n12.4 Heat, internal energy and\nwork\n\n12.5 First law of\nthermodynamics\n\n12.6 Specific heat capacity\n\n12.7 Thermodynamic state\nvariables and equation of\nstate\n\n12.8 Thermodynamic processes\n\n12.9 Heat engines\n\n12.10 Refrigerators and heat\npumps\n\n12.11 Second law of\nthermodynamics\n\n12.12 Reversible and irreversible\nprocesses\n\n12.13 Carnot engine\n\nSummary\n\nPoints to ponder\n\nExercises\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS304\n\nThermodynamics is the branch of physics that\ndeals with the concepts of heat and temperature\nand the inter-conversion of heat and other forms\nof energy. Thermodynamics is a macroscopic\nscience. It deals with bulk systems and does not\ngo into the molecular constitution of matter. In\nfact, its concepts and laws were formulated in the\nnineteenth century before the molecular picture\nof matter was firmly established.  Thermodynamic\ndescription involves relatively few macroscopic\nvariables of the system, which are suggested by\ncommon sense and can be usually measured\ndirectly. A microscopic description of a gas, for\nexample, would involve specifying the co-ordinates\nand velocities of the huge number of molecules\nconstituting the gas. The description in kinetic\ntheory of gases is not so detailed but it does involve\nmolecular distribution of velocities.\nThermodynamic description of a gas, on the other\nhand, avoids the molecular description altogether.\nInstead, the state of a gas in thermodynamics is\nspecified by macroscopic variables such as\npressure, volume, temperature, mass and\ncomposition that  are felt by our sense perceptions\n\nand are measurable*.\nThe distinction between mechanics and\n\nthermodynamics is worth bearing in mind.  In\nmechanics, our interest is in the motion of particles\nor bodies under the action of forces and torques.\nThermodynamics is not concerned with the\nmotion of the system as a whole.  It is concerned\nwith the internal macroscopic state of the body.\nWhen a bullet is fired from a gun, what changes\nis the mechanical state of the bullet (its kinetic\nenergy, in particular), not its temperature.  When\nthe bullet pierces a wood and stops, the kinetic\nenergy of the bullet gets converted into heat,\nchanging the temperature of the bullet and the\nsurrounding layers of wood.  Temperature is\nrelated to the energy of the internal (disordered)\nmotion of the bullet, not to the motion of the bullet\nas a whole.\n\n12.2  THERMAL EQUILIBRIUM\n\nEquilibrium in mechanics means that the net\nexternal force and torque on a system are zero.\nThe term ‘equilibrium’ in thermodynamics appears\n\nin a different context : we say the state of a system\n\nis an equilibrium state if the macroscopic\n\nvariables that characterise the system do not\nchange in time. For example, a gas inside a closed\n\nrigid container, completely insulated from its\n\nsurroundings, with fixed values of pressure,\n\nvolume, temperature, mass and composition that\n\ndo not change with time, is in a state of\n\nthermodynamic equilibrium.\n\nFig. 12.1 (a) Systems A and B (two gases) separated\nby an adiabatic wall – an insulating wall\n\nthat does not allow flow of heat. (b) The\n\nsame systems A and B separated by a\n\ndiathermic wall – a conducting wall that\n\nallows heat to flow from one to another.  In\n\nthis case, thermal equilibrium is attained\n\nin due course.\n\nIn general, whether or not a system is in a state\nof equilibrium depends on the surroundings and\nthe nature of the wall that separates the system\nfrom the surroundings.  Consider two gases A and\nB occupying two different containers. We know\nexperimentally that pressure and volume of a\ngiven mass of gas can be chosen to be its two\nindependent variables. Let the pressure and\nvolume of the gases be (P\n\nA\n, V\n\nA\n) and (P\n\nB\n, V\n\nB\n)\n\nrespectively.  Suppose first that the two systems\nare put in proximity but are separated by an\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n* Thermodynamics may also involve other variables that are not so obvious to our senses  e.g. entropy, enthalpy,\netc., and they are all macroscopic variables. However, a thermodynamic state is specified by five state\n\nvariables viz., pressure, volume, temperature, internal energy and entropy. Entropy is a measure of disorderness\n\nin the system. Enthalpy is a measure of total heat content of the system.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTHERMODYNAMICS 305\n\nadiabatic wall – an insulating wall (can be\nmovable) that does not allow flow of energy (heat)\nfrom one to another. The systems are insulated\nfrom the rest of the surroundings also by similar\nadiabatic walls. The situation is shown\nschematically in Fig. 12.1 (a). In this case, it is\nfound that any possible pair of values (P\n\nA\n, V\n\nA\n) will\n\nbe in equilibrium with any possible pair of values\n(P\n\nB\n, V\n\nB\n).  Next, suppose that the adiabatic wall is\n\nreplaced by a diathermic wall – a conducting wall\nthat allows energy flow (heat) from one to another.\nIt is then found that the macroscopic variables of\nthe systems A and B change spontaneously until\nboth the systems attain equilibrium states. After\nthat there is no change in their states. The\nsituation is shown in Fig. 12.1(b).  The pressure\nand volume variables of the two gases change to\n(P\n\nB\n′, V\n\nB\n′) and (P\n\nA\n′, V\n\nA\n′) such that the new states\n\nof A and B are in equilibrium with each other*.\nThere is no more energy flow from one to another.\nWe then say that the system A is in thermal\nequilibrium with the system B.\n\nWhat characterises the situation of thermal\nequilibrium between two systems ? You can guess\n\nthe answer from your experience. In thermal\n\nequilibrium, the temperatures of the two systems\nare equal. We shall see how does one arrive at the\nconcept of temperature in thermodynamics? The\nZeroth law of thermodynamics provides the clue.\n\n12.3  ZEROTH LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS\n\nImagine two systems A and B, separated by an\n\nadiabatic wall, while each is in contact with a third\n\nsystem C, via a conducting wall [Fig. 12.2(a)]. The\n\nstates of the systems (i.e., their macroscopic\n\nvariables) will change until both A and B come to\n\nthermal equilibrium with C. After this is achieved,\n\nsuppose that the adiabatic wall between A and B\n\nis replaced by a conducting wall and C is insulated\n\nfrom A and B by an adiabatic wall [Fig.12.2(b)]. It\n\nis found that the states of A and B change no\n\nfurther i.e. they are found to be in thermal\n\nequilibrium with each other. This observation\n\nforms the basis of the Zeroth Law of\n\nThermodynamics, which states that ‘two\n\nsystems in thermal equilibrium with a third\n\nsystem separately are in thermal equilibrium\n\nwith each other’.  R.H. Fowler formulated this\n\nlaw in 1931 long after the first and second Laws\n\nof thermodynamics were stated and so numbered.\n\nThe Zeroth Law clearly suggests that when two\nsystems A and B, are in thermal equilibrium,\nthere must be a physical quantity that has the\nsame value for both. This thermodynamic\nvariable whose value is equal for two systems in\nthermal equilibrium is called temperature (T ).\nThus, if A and B are separately in equilibrium\nwith C, TA = TC  and TB = TC.  This implies that\nTA = TB i.e. the systems A and B are also in\nthermal equilibrium.\n\nWe have arrived at the concept of temperature\nformally via the Zeroth Law.  The next question\nis : how to assign numerical values to\ntemperatures of different bodies ?  In other words,\nhow do we construct a scale of temperature ?\nThermometry deals with this basic question to\nwhich we turn in the next section.\n\nFig. 12.2 (a) Systems A and B are separated by an\nadiabatic wall, while each is in contact\n\nwith a third system C via a conducting\n\nwall. (b) The adiabatic wall between  A\n\nand B is replaced by a conducting wall,\n\nwhile C is insulated from A and B by an\n\nadiabatic wall.\n\n* Both the variables need not change. It depends on the constraints. For instance, if the gases are in containers\nof fixed volume, only the pressures of the gases would change to achieve thermal equilibrium.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS306\n\n12.4  HEAT, INTERNAL ENERGY AND WORK\n\nThe Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics led us to\nthe concept of temperature that agrees with our\n\ncommonsense notion.  Temperature is a marker\nof the ‘hotness’ of a body. It determines the\n\ndirection of flow of heat when two bodies are\nplaced in thermal contact.  Heat flows from the\nbody at a higher temperature to the one at lower\n\ntemperature. The flow stops when the\ntemperatures equalise; the two bodies are then\n\nin thermal equilibrium. We saw in some detail\nhow to construct temperature scales to assign\ntemperatures to different bodies. We now\n\ndescribe the concepts of heat and other relevant\nquantities like internal energy and work.\n\nThe concept of internal energy of a system is\nnot difficult to understand.  We know that every\nbulk system consists of a large number of\n\nmolecules.  Internal energy is simply the sum of\nthe kinetic energies and potential energies of\n\nthese molecules. We remarked earlier that in\nthermodynamics, the kinetic energy of the\nsystem, as a whole, is not relevant.  Internal\n\nenergy is thus, the sum of molecular kinetic and\npotential energies in the frame of reference\n\nrelative to which the centre of mass of the system\nis at rest. Thus, it includes only the (disordered)\n\nenergy associated with the random motion of\nmolecules of the system. We denote the internal\nenergy of a system by U.\n\nThough we have invoked the molecular\npicture to understand the meaning of internal\nenergy, as far as thermodynamics is concerned,\n\nU is simply a macroscopic variable of the system.\nThe important thing about internal energy is\n\nthat it depends only on the state of the system,\nnot on how that state was achieved.  Internal\n\nenergy U of a system is an example of a\nthermodynamic ‘state variable’ – its value\ndepends only on the given state of the system,\n\nnot on history i.e. not on the ‘path’ taken to arrive\nat that state. Thus, the internal energy of a given\n\nmass of gas depends on its state described by\nspecific values of pressure, volume and\ntemperature. It does not depend on how this\n\nstate of the gas came about. Pressure, volume,\ntemperature, and internal energy are\n\nthermodynamic state variables of the system\n(gas) (see section 12.7). If we neglect the small\n\nintermolecular forces in a gas, the internal\nenergy of a gas is just the sum of kinetic energies\n\nassociated with various random motions of its\nmolecules.  We will see in the next chapter that\nin a gas this motion is not only translational\n\n(i.e. motion from one point to another in the\nvolume of the container); it also includes\nrotational and vibrational motion of the\nmolecules (Fig. 12.3).\n\nFig. 12.3 (a) Internal energy U of a gas is the sum\nof the kinetic and potential energies of  its\n\nmolecules when the box is at rest. Kinetic\n\nenergy due to various types of motion\n\n(translational, rotational, vibrational) is to\n\nbe included in U.  (b) If the same box is\n\nmoving as a whole with some velocity,\n\nthe kinetic energy of the box is not to be\n\nincluded in U.\n\nFig. 12.4 Heat and work are two distinct modes of\nenergy transfer to a system that results  in\n\nchange in its internal energy. (a) Heat is\n\nenergy transfer due to temperature\n\ndifference between the system and the\n\nsurroundings.  (b) Work is energy transfer\n\nbrought about by means (e.g. moving the\n\npiston by raising or lowering some weight\n\nconnected to it) that do not involve such a\n\ntemperature difference.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTHERMODYNAMICS 307\n\nWhat are the ways of changing internal\nenergy of a system ? Consider again, for\nsimplicity, the system to be a certain mass of\ngas contained in a cylinder with a movable\npiston as shown in Fig. 12.4.  Experience shows\nthere are two ways of changing the state of the\ngas (and hence its internal energy).  One way is\nto put the cylinder in contact with a body at a\nhigher temperature than that of the gas. The\ntemperature difference will cause a flow of\nenergy (heat) from the hotter body to the gas,\nthus increasing the internal energy of the gas.\nThe other way is to push the piston down i.e. to\ndo work on the system, which again results in\nincreasing the internal energy of the gas.  Of\ncourse, both these things could happen in the\n\nreverse direction. With surroundings at a lower\ntemperature, heat would flow from the gas to\nthe surroundings.  Likewise, the gas could push\n\nthe piston up and do work on the surroundings.\nIn short, heat and work are two different modes\nof altering the state of a thermodynamic system\nand changing its internal energy.\n\nThe notion of heat should be carefully\ndistinguished from the notion of internal energy.\nHeat is certainly energy, but it is the energy in\ntransit.  This is not just a play of words.  The\ndistinction is of basic significance. The state of\na thermodynamic system is characterised by its\ninternal energy, not heat. A statement like ‘a\ngas in a given state has a certain amount of\nheat’ is as meaningless as the statement that\n‘a gas in a given state has a certain amount\nof work’.  In contrast, ‘a gas in a given state\nhas a certain amount of internal energy’ is a\nperfectly meaningful statement. Similarly, the\nstatements ‘a certain amount of heat is\nsupplied to the system’ or ‘a certain amount\nof work was done by the system’ are perfectly\nmeaningful.\n\nTo summarise, heat and work in\nthermodynamics are not state variables. They\nare modes of energy transfer to a system\n\nresulting in change in its internal energy,\nwhich, as already mentioned, is a state variable.\n\nIn ordinary language, we often confuse heat\n\nwith internal energy.  The distinction between\nthem is sometimes ignored in elementary\n\nphysics books. For proper understanding of\nthermodynamics, however, the distinction is\ncrucial.\n\n12.5  FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS\n\nWe have seen that the internal energy U of a\nsystem can change through two modes of energy\ntransfer : heat and work.  Let\n\n∆Q = Heat supplied to the system by the\nsurroundings\n\n∆W = Work done by the system on the\nsurroundings\n\n∆U = Change in internal energy of the system\nThe general principle of conservation of\n\nenergy then implies that\n\n∆Q =  ∆U + ∆W (12.1)\ni.e. the energy (∆Q) supplied to the system goes\nin partly to increase the internal energy of the\nsystem (∆U) and the rest in work on the\nenvironment (∆W). Equation (12.1) is known as\nthe First Law of Thermodynamics.  It is simply\nthe general law of conservation of energy applied\nto any system in which the energy transfer from\nor to the surroundings is taken into account.\n\nLet us put Eq. (12.1) in the alternative form\n\n∆Q  – ∆W  = ∆U (12.2)\n\nNow, the system may go from an initial state\nto the final state in a number of ways. For\nexample, to change the state of a gas from\n(P\n\n1\n, V\n\n1\n) to (P\n\n2\n, V\n\n2\n), we can first change the\n\nvolume of the gas from V\n1\n to V\n\n2\n, keeping its\n\npressure constant i.e. we can first go the state\n(P\n\n1\n, V\n\n2\n) and then change the pressure of the\n\ngas from P\n1\n to P\n\n2\n, keeping volume constant, to\n\ntake the gas to (P\n2\n, V\n\n2\n).  Alternatively, we can\n\nfirst keep the volume constant and then keep\nthe pressure constant. Since U is a state\nvariable, ∆U depends only on the initial and\nfinal states and not on the path taken by the\ngas to go from one to the other. However, ∆Q\nand ∆W will, in general, depend on the path\ntaken to go from the initial to final states. From\nthe First Law of Thermodynamics, Eq. (12.2),\nit is clear that the combination ∆Q – ∆W, is\nhowever, path independent. This shows that\nif a system is taken through a process in which\n∆U = 0 (for example, isothermal expansion of\nan ideal gas, see section 12.8),\n\n∆Q  = ∆W\n\ni.e., heat supplied to the system is used up\nentirely by the system in doing work on the\nenvironment.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS308\n\nIf the system is a gas in a cylinder with a\nmovable piston, the gas in moving the piston does\nwork. Since force is pressure times area, and\narea times displacement is volume, work done\nby the system against a constant pressure P is\n\n∆W  = P ∆V\n\nwhere ∆V is the change in volume of the gas.\nThus, for this case, Eq. (12.1) gives\n\n∆Q  = ∆U + P ∆V (12.3)\n\nAs an application of Eq. (12.3), consider the\n\nchange in internal energy for 1 g of water when\n\nwe go from its liquid to vapour phase. The\n\nmeasured latent heat of water is 2256 J/g. i.e.,\n\nfor 1 g of water ∆Q = 2256 J. At atmospheric\npressure, 1 g of water has a volume 1 cm3 in\nliquid phase and 1671 cm3 in vapour phase.\n\nTherefore,\n\n∆W =P (V\ng\n –V\n\nl \n) = 1.013 ×105 ×(1671×10–6) =169.2 J\n\nEquation (12.3) then gives\n\n∆U = 2256 – 169.2  =  2086.8 J\n\nWe see that most of the heat goes to increase\nthe internal energy of water in transition from\nthe liquid to the vapour phase.\n\n12.6  SPECIFIC HEAT CAPACITY\n\nSuppose an amount of heat ∆Q supplied to a\nsubstance changes its temperature from T to\nT + ∆T.  We define heat capacity of a substance\n(see Chapter 11) to be\n\nT\n\nQ\nS\n\n∆\n∆\n\n=  (12.4)\n\nWe expect ∆Q and, therefore, heat capacity S\nto be proportional to the mass of the substance.\nFurther, it could also depend on the\ntemperature, i.e., a different amount of heat may\nbe needed for a unit rise in temperature at\ndifferent temperatures. To define a constant\ncharacteristic of the substance and\nindependent of its amount, we divide S by the\nmass of the substance m  in kg :\n\ns\nS\n\nm m\n\nQ\n\nT\n    = = \uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n1 ∆\n∆ (12.5)\n\ns is known as the specific heat capacity of the\nsubstance. It depends on the nature of the\nsubstance and its temperature. The unit of\nspecific heat capacity is J kg–1 K–1.\n\nIf the amount of substance is specified in\nterms of moles µ (instead of mass m in kg ), we\ncan define heat capacity per mole of the\nsubstance by\n\n1S Q\nC\n\nTµ µ\n∆\n\n= =\n∆ (12.6)\n\nC is known as molar specific heat capacity of\nthe substance. Like s, C is independent of the\namount of substance. C depends on the nature\nof the substance, its temperature and the\nconditions under which heat is supplied. The\nunit of C is J mo1–1 K–1. As we shall see later (in\nconnection with specific heat capacity of gases),\nadditional conditions may be needed to define\nC or s. The idea in defining C is that simple\npredictions can be made in regard to molar\nspecific heat capacities.\n\nTable 12.1 lists measured specific and molar\nheat capacities of solids at atmospheric pressure\nand ordinary room temperature.\n\nWe will see in Chapter 13 that predictions of\nspecific heats of gases generally agree with\nexperiment. We can use the same law of\nequipartition of energy that we use there to\npredict molar specific heat capacities of solids\n(See Section 13.5 and 13.6).  Consider a solid of\nN atoms, each vibrating about its mean\nposition. An oscillator in one dimension has\naverage energy of 2 × ½ k\n\nB\nT = k\n\nB\nT. In three\n\ndimensions, the average energy is 3 k\nB\nT.\n\nFor a mole of a solid, the total energy is\n\nU  = 3 k\nB\nT  × N\n\nA\n  = 3 RT  (∵kBT  × NA = R )\n\nNow, at constant pressure, ∆Q = ∆U + P ∆V ≅\n∆U,  since for a solid ∆V is negligible.  Therefore,\n\nC\nQ\n\nT\n\nU\n\nT\nR= = =\n\n∆\n\n∆\n\n∆\n\n∆\n3 (12.7)\n\nTable 12.1 Specific and molar heat capacities\nof some solids at room\ntemperature and atmospheric\n\npressure\n\n   As Table 12.1 shows, the experimentally\n\nmeasured values which generally agrees with\n\nSubstance\nSpeci"c heat\n\n–v\n\n(J kg K )\n–1 –1\n\nMolar speci"c\nheat (J mol K )\n\n–1 –1\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTHERMODYNAMICS 309\n\npredicted value 3R at ordinary temperatures.\n(Carbon is an exception.) The agreement is\nknown to break down at low temperatures.\n\nSpecific heat capacity of water\n\nThe old unit of heat was calorie.  One calorie\nwas earlier defined to be the amount of heat\nrequired to raise the temperature of 1g of water\nby 1°C. With more precise measurements, it was\nfound that the specific heat of water varies\nslightly with temperature.  Figure 12.5 shows\nthis variation in the temperature range 0 to\n100 °C.\n\nFig. 12.5 Variation of specific heat capacity of water\n\nwith temperature.\n\nFor a precise definition of calorie, it was,\n\ntherefore, necessary to specify the unit\n\ntemperature interval. One calorie is defined\n\nto be the amount of heat required to raise the\n\ntemperature of 1g of water from 14.5 °C to\n\n15.5 °C. Since heat is just a form of energy,\n\nit is preferable to use the unit joule, J.\n\nIn SI units, the specific heat capacity of water\n\nis 4186 J kg\n–1\n\n K\n–1\n\n i.e. 4.186 J g\n–1\n\n K\n–1\n\n. The so\n\ncalled mechanical equivalent of heat defined\n\nas the amount of work needed to produce\n\n1 cal of heat is in fact just a conversion factor\n\nbetween two different units of energy : calorie\n\nto joule. Since in SI units, we use the unit joule\n\nfor heat, work or any other form of energy, the\n\nterm mechanical equivalent is now\n\nsuperfluous and need not be used.\n\nAs already remarked, the specific heat\n\ncapacity depends on the process or the\n\nconditions under which heat capacity transfer\n\ntakes place.  For gases, for example, we can\n\ndefine two specific heats : specific heat\n\ncapacity at constant volume and specific\nheat capacity at constant pressure.  For an\n\nideal gas, we have a simple relation.\n\n        C\np\n  –  C\n\nv\n = R (12.8)\n\nwhere C\np\n and C\n\nv\n  are molar specific heat\n\ncapacities of an ideal gas at constant pressure\n\nand volume respectively and R is the universal\n\ngas constant.  To prove the relation, we begin\n\nwith Eq. (12.3) for 1 mole of the gas :\n\n                ∆Q  = ∆U + P ∆V\n\nIf ∆Q  is absorbed at constant volume, ∆V = 0\n\n   C\nQ\n\nT\n\nU\n\nT\n\nU\n\nT\nv\n\nv v\n\n= \uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n= \uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n= \uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n∆\n∆\n\n∆\n∆\n\n∆\n∆ (12.9)\n\nwhere the subscript v is dropped in the last\nstep, since U of an ideal gas depends only on\ntemperature. (The subscript denotes the\nquantity kept fixed.)

(12.8).\n\n12.7 THERMODYNAMIC STATE VARIABLES\nAND EQUATION OF STATE\n\nEvery equilibrium state of a thermodynamic\nsystem is completely described by specific\n\nvalues of some macroscopic variables, also\n\ncalled state variables. For example, an\n\nequilibrium state of a gas is completely\n\nspecified by the values of pressure, volume,\ntemperature, and mass (and composition if\n\nthere is a mixture of gases). A thermodynamic\n\nsystem is not always in equilibrium. For example,\n\na gas allowed to expand freely  against vacuum\n\nis not an equilibrium state [Fig. 12.6(a)]. During\n\nthe rapid expansion, pressure of the gas may\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS310\n\nnot be uniform throughout. Similarly, a mixture\n\nof gases undergoing an explosive chemical\n\nreaction (e.g. a mixture of petrol vapour and\n\nair when ignited by a spark) is not an\n\nequilibrium state; again its temperature and\n\npressure are not uniform [Fig. 12.6(b)].\n\nEventually, the gas attains a uniform\n\ntemperature and pressure and comes to\n\nthermal and mechanical equilibrium with its\n\nsurroundings.\n\nFig. 12.6 (a) The partition in the box is suddenly\nremoved leading to free expansion of the\n\ngas. (b) A mixture of gases undergoing an\n\nexplosive chemical reaction. In both\n\nsituations, the gas is not in equilibrium and\n\ncannot be described by state variables.\n\nIn short, thermodynamic state variables\ndescribe equilibrium states of systems. The\nvarious state variables are not necessarily\nindependent. The connection between the state\nvariables is called the equation of state. For\nexample, for an ideal gas, the equation of state\nis the ideal gas relation\n\n   P V = µ R T\nFor a fixed amount of the gas i.e. given µ, there\n\nare thus, only two independent variables, say P\nand V or T and V.  The pressure-volume curve\nfor a fixed temperature is called an isotherm.\nReal gases may have more complicated\nequations of state.\n\nThe thermodynamic state variables are of two\nkinds: extensive and intensive. Extensive\nvariables indicate the ‘size’ of the system.\nIntensive variables such as pressure and\n\ntemperature do not. To decide which variable is\nextensive and which intensive, think of a\nrelevant system in equilibrium, and imagine that\nit is divided into two equal parts. The variables\nthat remain unchanged for each part are\nintensive. The variables whose values get halved\nin each part are extensive. It is easily seen, for\nexample, that internal energy U, volume V, total\nmass M are extensive variables. Pressure P,\ntemperature T, and density ρ are intensive\nvariables.  It is a good practice to check the\nconsistency of thermodynamic equations using\nthis classification of variables. For example, in\nthe equation\n\n      ∆Q = ∆U + P ∆V\n\nquantities on both sides are extensive*. (The\nproduct of an intensive variable like P and an\nextensive quantity ∆V is extensive.)\n\n12.8  THERMODYNAMIC PROCESSES\n\n12.8.1  Quasi-static process\n\nConsider a gas in thermal and mechanical\nequilibrium with its surroundings. The pressure\nof the gas in that case equals the external\npressure and its temperature is the same as\nthat of its surroundings. Suppose that the\nexternal pressure is suddenly reduced (say by\nlifting the weight on the movable piston in the\ncontainer).  The piston will accelerate outward.\nDuring the process, the gas passes through\nstates that are not equilibrium states. The non-\nequilibrium states do not have well-defined\npressure and temperature. In the same way, if\na finite temperature difference exists between\nthe gas and its surroundings, there will be a\nrapid exchange of heat during which the gas\nwill pass through non-equilibrium states.  In\ndue course, the gas will settle to an equilibrium\nstate with well-defined temperature and\npressure equal to those of the surroundings. The\nfree expansion of a gas in vacuum and a mixture\nof gases undergoing an explosive chemical\nreaction, mentioned in section 12.7 are also\nexamples where the system goes through non-\nequilibrium states.\n\nNon-equilibrium states of a system are difficult\nto deal with.  It is, therefore, convenient to\nimagine an idealised process in which at every\nstage the system is an equilibrium state. Such a\n\n* As emphasised earlier, Q is not a state variable.  However, ∆Q is clearly proportional to the total mass of\nsystem and hence is extensive.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTHERMODYNAMICS 311\n\nprocess is, in principle, infinitely slow, hence the\nname quasi-static (meaning nearly static). The\nsystem changes its variables (P, T, V ) so slowly\n\nthat it remains in thermal and mechanical\nequilibrium with its surroundings throughout.\n\nIn a quasi-static process, at every stage, the\ndifference in the pressure of the system and the\nexternal pressure is infinitesimally small.  The\n\nsame is true of the temperature difference\nbetween the system and its surroundings\n\n(Fig.12.7).  To take a gas from the state (P, T ) to\nanother state (P ′, T ′ ) via  a quasi-static process,\nwe change the external pressure by a very small\namount, allow the system to equalise its pressure\nwith that of the surroundings and continue the\n\nprocess infinitely slowly until the system\nachieves the pressure P ′. Similarly, to change\nthe temperature, we introduce an infinitesimal\ntemperature difference between the system and\nthe surrounding reservoirs and by choosing\n\nreservoirs of progressively different temperatures\nT to T ′, the system achieves the temperature T ′.\n\nFig. 12.7 In a quasi-static process, the temperature\n\nof the surrounding reservoir and the\n\nexternal pressure differ only infinitesimally\n\nfrom the temperature and pressure of the\n\nsystem.\n\nA quasi-static process is obviously a\n\nhypothetical construct.  In practice, processes\n\nthat are sufficiently slow and do not involve\n\naccelerated motion of the piston, large\n\ntemperature gradient, etc., are reasonably\n\napproximation to an ideal quasi-static process.\n\nWe shall from now on deal with quasi-static\n\nprocesses only, except when stated otherwise.\n\nA process in which the temperature of the\nsystem is kept fixed throughout is called an\nisothermal process.  The expansion of a gas in\na metallic cylinder placed in a large reservoir of\nfixed temperature is an example of an isothermal\nprocess.  (Heat transferred from the reservoir to\nthe system does not materially affect the\ntemperature of the reservoir, because of its very\nlarge heat capacity.)  In isobaric processes the\npressure is constant while in isochoric\nprocesses the volume is constant.  Finally, if\nthe system is insulated from the surroundings\nand no heat flows between the system and the\nsurroundings, the process is adiabatic. The\ndefinitions of these special processes are\nsummarised in Table. 12.2\n\nTable 12.2 Some special thermodynamic\nprocesses\n\nWe now consider these processes in some detail :\n\n12.8.2 Isothermal process\n\nFor an isothermal process (T fixed), the ideal gas\nequation gives\n\n                  PV  =  constant\n\ni.e., pressure of a given mass of gas varies inversely\nas its volume. This is nothing but Boyle’s Law.\n\nSuppose an ideal gas goes isothermally (at\ntemperature T ) from its initial state (P\n\n1\n, V\n\n1\n) to\n\nthe final state (P\n2\n, V \n\n2\n).  At any intermediate stage\n\nwith pressure P and volume change from V to\nV + ∆V (∆V small)\n\n     ∆W  = P ∆ V\n\nTaking (∆V → 0) and summing the quantity\n∆W over the entire process,\n\nW = P V\n\nV\n\nV\n\n1\n\n2\n\n d∫\n\n=  RT\n\nV\n\nV\n\nRT    \nV\n\nV\n\nV\n\nV\n1\n\n2\n2\n\n1\n\nµ µ\nd\n\n∫ =    In (12.12)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS312\n\nwhere in the second  step we have made use of\nthe ideal gas equation PV = µ RT and  taken the\nconstants out of the integral.  For an ideal gas,\ninternal energy depends only on temperature.\nThus, there is no change in the internal energy\nof an ideal gas in an isothermal process. The\nFirst Law of Thermodynamics then implies that\nheat supplied to the gas equals the work done\nby the gas : Q = W.  Note from Eq. (12.12) that\nfor V\n\n2\n > V\n\n1\n,  W > 0; and for V\n\n2\n < V\n\n1\n, W < 0.  That\n\nis, in an isothermal expansion, the gas absorbs\nheat and does work while in an isothermal\ncompression, work is  done on the gas by the\nenvironment and heat is released.\n\n12.8.3 Adiabatic process\n\nIn an adiabatic process, the system is insulated\nfrom the surroundings and heat absorbed or\nreleased is zero. From Eq. (12.1), we see that\nwork done by the gas results in decrease in its\ninternal energy (and hence its temperature for\nan ideal gas).  We quote without proof (the result\nthat you will learn in higher courses) that for\nan adiabatic process of an ideal gas.\n\n    P V γ   =  const (12.13)\n\nwhere γ  is the ratio of specific heats (ordinary\nor molar) at constant pressure and at constant\nvolume.\n\n               γ =\nC\n\np\n\nC\nv\n\nThus if an ideal gas undergoes a change in\nits state adiabatically from (P\n\n1\n, V\n\n1\n) to (P\n\n2\n, V\n\n2\n) :\n\nP\n1\n V\n\n1\n\nγ  = P\n2\n V\n\n2\n\nγ\n(12.14)\n\nFigure12.8 shows the P-V curves of an ideal\ngas for two adiabatic processes connecting two\nisotherms.\n\nFig. 12.8 P-V curves for isothermal and adiabatic\n\nprocesses of an ideal gas.\n\nWe can calculate, as before, the work done in\nan adiabatic change of an ideal gas from the\nstate (P\n\n1\n, V\n\n1\n, T\n\n1\n) to the state (P\n\n2\n, V\n\n2\n, T\n\n2\n).\n\n         W = P V\n\nV\n\nV\n\n  d\n\n1\n\n2\n\n∫\n\n(12.15)\n\nFrom Eq. (12.14), the constant is P\n1\nV\n\n1\nγ  or P\n\n2\nV\n\n2\nγ\n\nW = \nP V\n\nV\n\nP V\n\nV\n \n\n2 2\n\n2\n\n1 1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1  − − −\n−\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ef\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8fb\n\uf8fa\n\nγ\n\nγ\n\nγ\n\nγ\n\nγ1 1\n\n = P V P V\nR(T T1\n\n1  −\n−\n\n−\n\n−\n[ ] =\n\nγ\n\nµ\n\nγ\n2 2 1 1\n\n1 2 )\n\n1\n(12.16)\n\nAs expected, if work is done by the gas in an\n\nadiabatic process (W > 0), from Eq. (12.16),\n\nT\n2\n < T\n\n1\n.  On the other hand, if work is done on\n\nthe gas (W < 0), we get T\n2\n > T\n\n1\n i.e., the\n\ntemperature of the gas rises.\n\n12.8.4 Isochoric process\n\nIn an isochoric process, V is constant. No work\nis done on or by the gas.  From Eq. (12.1), the\nheat absorbed by the gas goes entirely to change\nits internal energy and its temperature.  The\nchange in temperature for a given amount of\nheat is determined by the specific heat of the\ngas at constant volume.\n\n12.8.5 Isobaric process\n\nIn an isobaric process, P is fixed. Work done by\nthe gas is\n\nW = P (V\n2\n – V\n\n1\n)  =  µ R (T\n\n2\n – T\n\n1\n)    (12.17)\n\nSince temperature changes, so does internal\n\nenergy. The heat absorbed goes partly to\nincrease internal energy and partly to do work.\n\nThe change in temperature for a given amount\nof heat is determined by the specific heat of the\ngas at constant pressure.\n\n12.8.6 Cyclic process\n\nIn a cyclic process, the system returns to its\ninitial state. Since internal energy is a state\nvariable, ∆U = 0 for a cyclic process. From\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTHERMODYNAMICS 313\n\nEq. (12.1), the total heat absorbed equals the\nwork done by the system.\n\n12.9  HEAT ENGINES\n\nHeat engine is a device by which a system is\nmade to undergo a cyclic process that results\nin conversion of heat to work.\n(1) It consists of a working substance–the\n\nsystem. For example, a mixture of fuel\nvapour and air in a gasoline or diesel engine\nor steam in a steam engine are the working\nsubstances.\n\n(2) The working substance goes through a cycle\nconsisting of several processes. In some of\nthese processes, it absorbs a total amount\nof heat Q\n\n1\n from an external reservoir at some\n\nhigh temperature T\n1\n.\n\n(3) In some other processes of the cycle, the\nworking substance releases a total amount\nof heat Q\n\n2\n to an external reservoir at some\n\nlower temperature T\n2\n.\n\n(4) The work done (W ) by the system in a cycle\nis transferred to the environment via some\narrangement (e.g. the working substance\nmay be in a cylinder with a moving piston\nthat transfers mechanical energy to the\nwheels of a vehicle via a shaft).\n\nThe basic features of a heat engine are\nschematically represented in Fig. 12.9.\n\nFig. 12.9 Schematic representation of a heat engine.\nThe engine takes heat Q\n\n1\n from a hot\n\nreservoir at temperature T\n1\n, releases heat\n\nQ\n2\n to a cold reservoir at temperature T\n\n2\n\nand delivers work W to the surroundings.\n\nThe cycle is repeated again and again to get\nuseful work for some purpose. The discipline of\nthermodynamics has its roots in the study of heat\nengines. A basic question relates to the efficiency\nof a heat engine. The efficiency (η) of a heat\nengine is defined by\n\n1Q\n\nW\n = η (12.18)\n\nwhere Q\n1\n is the heat input i.e., the heat\n\nabsorbed by the system in one complete cycle\n\nand W is the work done on the environment in\na cycle. In a cycle, a certain amount of heat (Q\n\n2\n)\n\nmay also be rejected to the environment. Then,\naccording to the First Law of Thermodynamics,\nover one complete cycle,\n\nW  =  Q\n1\n – Q\n\n2\n(12.19)\n\ni.e.,\n\n1Q\n2Q −  = 1η (12.20)\n\nFor Q\n2\n = 0, η = 1, i.e., the engine will have\n\n100% efficiency in converting heat into work.\nNote that the First Law of Thermodynamics i.e.,\nthe energy conservation law does not rule out\nsuch an engine. But experience shows that\nsuch an ideal engine with η = 1 is never possible,\neven if we can eliminate various kinds of losses\nassociated with actual heat engines. It turns\nout that there is a fundamental limit on the\nefficiency of a heat engine set by an independent\nprinciple of nature, called the Second Law of\nThermodynamics (section 12.11).\n\nThe mechanism of conversion of heat into\nwork varies for different heat engines.  Basically,\nthere are two ways : the system (say a gas or a\nmixture of gases) is heated by an external\nfurnace, as in a steam engine; or it is heated\ninternally by an exothermic chemical reaction\nas in an internal combustion engine. The\nvarious steps involved in a cycle also differ from\none engine to another.\n\n12.10  REFRIGERATORS AND HEAT PUMPS\n\nA refrigerator is the reverse of a heat engine.\nHere the working substance extracts heat Q\n\n2\n\nfrom the cold reservoir at temperature T\n2\n, some\n\nexternal work W is done on it and heat Q\n1\n is\n\nreleased to the hot reservoir at temperature T\n1\n\n(Fig. 12.10).\n\nFig. 12.10 Schematic representation of a refrigerator\nor a heat pump, the reverse of a heat\n\nengine.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS314\n\nA heat pump is the same as a refrigerator.\n\nWhat term we use depends on the purpose of\n\nthe device.  If the purpose is to cool a portion of\n\nspace, like the inside of a chamber, and higher\n\ntemperature reservoir is surrounding, we call\n\nthe device a refrigerator; if the idea is to pump\n\nheat into a portion of space (the room in a\n\nbuilding when the outside environment is cold),\n\nthe device is called a heat pump.\n\nIn a refrigerator the working substance\n\n(usually, in gaseous form) goes through the\n\nfollowing steps : (a) sudden expansion of the gas\n\nfrom high to low pressure which cools it and\n\nconverts it into a vapour-liquid mixture, (b)\n\nabsorption by the cold fluid of heat from the\n\nregion to be cooled converting it into vapour, (c)\n\nheating up of the vapour due to external work\n\ndone on the system, and (d) release of heat by\n\nthe vapour to the surroundings, bringing it to\n\nthe initial state and completing the cycle.\n\nThe coefficient of performance (α) of a\nrefrigerator is given by\n\n2Q\n\nW\nα =  (12.21)\n\nwhere Q\n2\n is the heat extracted from the cold\n\nreservoir and W is the work done on the\nsystem–the refrigerant. (α for heat pump is\ndefined as Q\n\n1\n/W) Note that while η by definition\n\ncan never exceed 1, α can be greater than 1.\nBy energy conservation, the heat released to the\nhot reservoir is\n\nQ\n1\n  = W +  Q\n\n2\n\ni.e.,\n2\n\n1 2–\n\nQ\n\nQ Q\nα  = \n\n  (12.22)\n\nIn a heat engine, heat cannot be fully\nconverted to work; likewise a refrigerator cannot\nwork without some external work done on the\nsystem, i.e., the coefficient of performance in Eq.\n(12.21) cannot be infinite.\n\n12.11  SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS\n\nThe First Law of Thermodynamics is the principle\n\nof conservation of energy.  Common experience\n\nshows that there are many conceivable\nprocesses that are perfectly allowed by the First\n\nLaw and yet are never observed.  For example,\n\nnobody has ever seen a book lying on a table\n\njumping to a height by itself.  But such a thing\n\nPioneers of Thermodynamics\n\nLord Kelvin (William Thomson)  (1824-1907), born in Belfast, Ireland, is\n\namong the foremost British scientists of the nineteenth century.  Thomson\n\nplayed a key role in the development of the law of conservation of energy\n\nsuggested by the work of James Joule (1818-1889), Julius Mayer (1814-\n\n1878) and Hermann Helmholtz (1821-1894). He collaborated with Joule\n\non the so-called Joule-Thomson effect : cooling of a gas when it expands\n\ninto vacuum.  He introduced the notion of the absolute zero of temperature\n\nand proposed the absolute temperature scale, now called the Kelvin scale\n\nin his honour.  From the work of Sadi Carnot (1796-1832), Thomson arrived\n\nat a form of the Second Law of Thermodynamics.  Thomson was a versatile\n\nphysicist, with notable contributions to electromagnetic theory and\n\nhydrodynamics.\n\nRudolf Clausius (1822-1888), born in Poland, is generally regarded as\n\nthe discoverer of the Second Law of Thermodynamics.  Based on the work\n\nof Carnot and Thomson, Clausius arrived at the important notion of entropy\n\nthat led him to a fundamental version of the Second Law of\n\nThermodynamics that states that the entropy of an isolated system can\n\nnever decrease. Clausius also worked on the kinetic theory of gases and\n\nobtained the first reliable estimates of molecular size, speed, mean free\n\npath, etc.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTHERMODYNAMICS 315\n\nwould be possible if the principle of conservation\n\nof energy were the only restriction. The table\n\ncould cool spontaneously, converting some of its\ninternal energy into an equal amount of\n\nmechanical energy of the book, which would\n\nthen hop to a height with potential energy equal\n\nto the mechanical energy it acquired.  But this\n\nnever happens. Clearly, some additional basic\n\nprinciple of nature forbids the above, even\nthough it satisfies the energy conservation\n\nprinciple.  This principle, which disallows many\n\nphenomena consistent with the First Law of\nThermodynamics is known as the Second Law\nof Thermodynamics.\n\nThe Second Law of Thermodynamics gives a\nfundamental limitation to the efficiency of a heat\nengine and the co-efficient of performance of a\nrefrigerator. In simple terms, it says that\nefficiency of a heat engine can never be unity.\nAccording to Eq. (12.20), this implies that heat\nreleased to the cold reservoir can never be made\nzero. For a refrigerator, the Second Law says that\nthe co-efficient of performance can never be\ninfinite.  According to Eq. (12.21), this implies\nthat external work (W ) can never be zero. The\nfollowing two statements, one due to Kelvin and\nPlanck denying the possibility of a perfect heat\nengine, and another due to Clausius denying\nthe possibility of a perfect refrigerator or heat\npump, are a concise summary of these\nobservations.\n\nKelvin-Planck statement\n\nNo process is possible whose sole result is the\nabsorption of heat from a reservoir and the\ncomplete conversion of the heat into work.\n\nClausius statement\n\nNo process is possible whose sole result is the\ntransfer of heat from a colder object to a hotter\nobject.\n\nIt can be proved that the two statements\nabove are completely equivalent.\n\n12.12  REVERSIBLE AND IRREVERSIBLE\nPROCESSES\n\nImagine some process in which a thermodynamic\nsystem goes from an initial state i to a final\nstate f. During the process the system absorbs\nheat Q from the surroundings and performs\nwork W on it. Can we reverse this process and\n\nbring both the system and surroundings to their\n\ninitial states with no other effect anywhere ?\n\nExperience suggests that for most processes in\n\nnature this is not possible. The spontaneous\n\nprocesses of nature are irreversible. Several\nexamples can be cited. The base of a vessel on\n\nan oven is hotter than its other parts. When\n\nthe vessel is removed, heat is transferred from\n\nthe base to the other parts, bringing the vessel\n\nto a uniform temperature (which in due course\n\ncools to the temperature of the surroundings).\nThe process cannot be reversed; a part of the\n\nvessel will not get cooler spontaneously and\n\nwarm up the base. It will violate the Second Law\n\nof Thermodynamics, if it did. The free expansion\n\nof a gas is irreversible. The combustion reaction\n\nof a mixture of petrol and air ignited by a spark\ncannot be reversed. Cooking gas leaking from a\n\ngas cylinder in the kitchen diffuses to the\n\nentire room. The diffusion process will not\n\nspontaneously reverse and bring the gas back\n\nto the cylinder. The stirring of a liquid in thermal\n\ncontact with a reservoir will convert the work\ndone into heat, increasing the internal energy\n\nof the reservoir. The process cannot be reversed\n\nexactly; otherwise it would amount to conversion\n\nof heat entirely into work, violating the Second\n\nLaw of Thermodynamics. Irreversibility is a rule\n\nrather an exception in nature.\nIrreversibility arises mainly from two causes:\n\none, many processes (like a free expansion, or\n\nan explosive chemical reaction) take the system\n\nto non-equilibrium states; two, most processes\n\ninvolve friction, viscosity and other dissipative\n\neffects (e.g., a moving body coming to a stop and\nlosing its mechanical energy as heat to the floor\n\nand the body; a rotating blade in a liquid coming\n\nto a stop due to viscosity and losing its\n\nmechanical energy with corresponding gain in\n\nthe internal energy  of the liquid). Since\n\ndissipative effects are present everywhere and\ncan be minimised but not fully eliminated, most\n\nprocesses that we deal with are irreversible.\n\nA thermodynamic process  (state i → state f )\nis reversible if the process can be turned back\n\nsuch that both the system and the surroundings\n\nreturn to their original states, with no other\n\nchange anywhere else in the universe. From the\n\npreceding discussion, a reversible process is an\n\nidealised notion. A process is reversible only if\n\nit is quasi-static (system in equilibrium with the\n\nsurroundings at every stage) and there are no\n\ndissipative effects. For example, a quasi-static\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS316\n\nisothermal expansion of an ideal gas in a\ncylinder fitted with a frictionless movable piston\nis a reversible process.\n\nWhy is reversibility such a basic concept in\nthermodynamics ?  As we have seen, one of the\nconcerns of thermodynamics is the efficiency\nwith which heat can be converted into work.\nThe Second Law of Thermodynamics rules out\nthe possibility of a perfect heat engine with 100%\nefficiency. But what is the highest efficiency\npossible for a heat engine working between two\nreservoirs at temperatures T\n\n1\n and T\n\n2\n? It turns\n\nout that a heat engine based on idealised\nreversible processes achieves the highest\nefficiency possible. All other engines involving\nirreversibility in any way (as would be the case\nfor practical engines) have lower than this\nlimiting efficiency.\n\n12.13  CARNOT ENGINE\n\nSuppose we have a hot reservoir at temperature\n\nT\n1\n and a cold reservoir at temperature T\n\n2\n.  What\n\nis the maximum efficiency possible for a heat\n\nengine operating between the two reservoirs and\n\nwhat cycle of processes should be adopted to\n\nachieve the maximum efficiency ?  Sadi Carnot,\n\na French engineer, first considered this question\n\nin 1824. Interestingly, Carnot arrived at the\n\ncorrect answer, even though the basic concepts\n\nof heat and thermodynamics had yet to be firmly\n\nestablished.\n\nWe expect the ideal engine operating between\n\ntwo temperatures to be a reversible engine.\n\nIrreversibility is associated with dissipative\n\neffects, as remarked in the preceding section,\n\nand lowers efficiency. A process is reversible if\n\nit is quasi-static and non-dissipative.  We have\n\nseen that a process is not quasi-static if it\n\ninvolves finite temperature difference between\n\nthe system and the reservoir.  This implies that\n\nin a reversible heat engine operating between\ntwo temperatures, heat should be absorbed\n\n(from the hot reservoir) isothermally and\n\nreleased (to the cold reservoir) isothermally.  We\n\nthus have identified two steps of the reversible\n\nheat engine : isothermal process at temperature\nT\n\n1\n absorbing heat Q\n\n1\n from the hot reservoir, and\n\nanother isothermal process at temperature T\n2\n\nreleasing heat Q\n2\n to the cold reservoir. To\n\ncomplete a cycle, we need to take the system\n\nfrom temperature T\n1\n to T\n\n2\n and then back from\n\ntemperature T\n2\n to T\n\n1\n.  Which processes should\n\nwe employ for this purpose that are reversible?\nA little reflection shows that we can only adopt\nreversible adiabatic processes for these\npurposes, which involve no heat flow from any\nreservoir. If we employ any other process that is\nnot adiabatic, say an isochoric process, to take\nthe system from one temperature to another, we\nshall need a series of reservoirs in the\ntemperature range T\n\n2\n to T\n\n1\n to ensure that at each\n\nstage the process is quasi-static.  (Remember\nagain that for a process to be quasi-static and\nreversible, there should be no finite temperature\ndifference between the system and the reservoir.)\nBut we are considering a reversible engine that\noperates between only two temperatures. Thus\nadiabatic processes must bring about the\ntemperature change in the system from T\n\n1\n to T\n\n2\n\nand T\n2\n to T\n\n1\n in this engine.\n\nFig. 12.11 Carnot cycle for a heat engine with an\nideal gas as  the working substance.\n\nA reversible heat engine operating between\ntwo temperatures is called a Carnot engine.  We\nhave just argued that such an engine must have\n\nthe following sequence of steps constituting one\n\ncycle, called the Carnot cycle, shown in Fig.\n\n12.11. We have taken the working substance of\n\nthe Carnot engine to be an ideal gas.\n\n(a) Step 1 → 2 Isothermal expansion of the gas\ntaking its  state from (P\n\n1\n, V\n\n1\n, T\n\n1\n)  to\n\n(P\n2\n, V\n\n2\n, T\n\n1\n).\n\nThe heat absorbed by the gas (Q\n1\n) from the\n\nreservoir at temperature T\n1\n is given by\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTHERMODYNAMICS 317\n\nEq.

Indeed it is the only\n\nreversible engine possible that works between\n\ntwo reservoirs at different temperatures.  Each\n\nstep of the Carnot cycle given in Fig. 12.11 can\n\nbe reversed. This will amount to taking heat Q\n2\n\nfrom the cold reservoir at T\n2\n, doing work W on\n\nthe system, and transferring heat Q\n1\n to the hot\n\nreservoir. This will be a reversible refrigerator.\n\nWe next establish the important result\n\n(sometimes called Carnot’s theorem) that\n\n(a) working between two given temperatures T\n1\n\nand T\n2\n of the hot and cold reservoirs respectively,\n\nno engine can have efficiency more than that of\n\nthe Carnot engine and (b) the efficiency of the\n\nCarnot engine is independent of the nature of\n\nthe working substance.\n\nTo prove the result (a), imagine a reversible\n(Carnot) engine R and an irreversible engine I\nworking between the same source (hot reservoir)\nand sink (cold reservoir). Let us couple the\nengines, I and R, in such a way so that I acts\nlike a heat engine and R acts as a refrigerator.\nLet I absorb heat Q\n\n1\n from the source, deliver\n\nwork W ′ and release the heat Q\n1\n- W′   to the sink.\n\nWe arrange so that R returns the same heat Q\n1\n\nto the source, taking heat Q\n2\n from the sink and\n\nrequiring work W = Q\n1\n – Q\n\n2\n to be done on it.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS318\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. The zeroth law of thermodynamics states that ‘two systems in thermal equilibrium with a\nthird system separately are in thermal equilibrium with each other’.  The Zeroth Law leads\nto the concept of temperature.\n\n2. Internal energy of a system is the sum of kinetic energies and potential energies of the\nmolecular constituents of the system. It does not include the over-all kinetic energy of\nthe system. Heat and work are two modes of energy transfer to the system.  Heat is the\nenergy transfer arising due to temperature difference between the system and the\nsurroundings. Work is energy transfer brought about by other means, such as moving\nthe piston of a cylinder containing the gas, by raising or lowering some weight connected\nto it.\n\n3. The first law of thermodynamics is the general law of conservation of energy applied to\nany system in which energy transfer from or to the surroundings (through heat and\nwork) is taken into account.  It states that\n\n∆Q  = ∆U  +  ∆W\n\nwhere ∆Q is the heat supplied to the system, ∆W is the work done by the system and ∆U\nis the change in internal energy of the system.\n\nNow suppose η\nR\n < η\n\nI\n i.e. if R were to act\n\nas an engine it would give less work output\nthan that of I i.e. W < W ′ for a given Q\n\n1\n. With R\n\nacting like a refrigerator, this would mean\nQ\n\n2\n =  Q\n\n1\n – W >  Q\n\n1\n – W ′. Thus, on the  whole,\n\nthe coupled I-R system extracts heat\n(Q\n\n1\n – W) – (Q\n\n1\n – W ′) = (W ′ – W ) from the cold\n\nreservoir and delivers the same amount of  work\nin one cycle, without any change in the source\nor anywhere else. This is clearly against the\nKelvin-Planck statement of the Second Law of\nThermodynamics.  Hence the assertion η\n\nI\n > η\n\nR\n\nis wrong.  No engine can have efficiency greater\n\nthan that of the Carnot engine. A similar\nargument can be constructed to show that a\nreversible engine with one particular substance\ncannot be more efficient than the one using\nanother substance. The maximum efficiency of\na Carnot engine given by Eq. (12.32) is\nindependent of the nature of the system\nperforming the Carnot cycle of operations. Thus\nwe are justified in using an ideal gas as a system\nin the calculation of efficiency η of a Carnot\nengine. The ideal gas has a simple equation of\nstate, which allows us to readily calculate η, but\nthe final result for η, [Eq. (12.32)], is true for\nany Carnot engine.\n\nThis final remark shows that in a Carnot\ncycle,\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\nT\n\nT\n= \n\nQ\n\nQ\n(12.33)\n\nis a universal relation independent of  the nature\nof the system.  Here Q\n\n1\n and Q\n\n2\n are respectively,\n\nthe heat absorbed and released isothermally\n(from the hot and to the cold reservoirs) in a\nCarnot engine. Equation (12.33), can, therefore,\nbe used as a relation to define a truly universal\nthermodynamic temperature scale that is\nindependent of any particular properties of the\nsystem used in the Carnot cycle.  Of course, for\nan ideal gas as a working substance, this\nuniversal temperature is the same as the ideal\n\ngas temperature introduced in section 12.11.\n\nI\n\nR\n\nW\n\nFig. 12.12 An irreversible engine (I) coupled to a\n\nreversible refrigerator (R). If W ′ > W, this\nwould amount to extraction of heat\n\nW ′ – W from the sink and its full\nconversion to work, in contradiction with\n\nthe Second Law of Thermodynamics.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTHERMODYNAMICS 319\n\n4. The specific heat capacity of a substance is defined by\n\ns\nm\n\nQ\n\nT\n=\n\n1 ∆\n∆\n\nwhere m is the mass of the substance and ∆Q is the heat required to change its\ntemperature by ∆T.  The molar specific heat capacity of a substance is defined by\n\n1 Q\nC\n\nTµ\n∆\n\n=\n∆\n\nwhere µ is the number  of moles of the substance. For a solid, the law of equipartition\nof energy gives\n\nC  =  3 R\n\nwhich generally agrees with experiment at ordinary temperatures.\n\nCalorie is the old unit of heat. 1 calorie is the amount of heat required to raise the\ntemperature of 1 g of water from 14.5 °C to 15.5 °C.  1 cal  =  4.186 J.\n\n5. For an ideal gas, the molar specific heat capacities at constant pressure and volume\nsatisfy the relation\n\nC\np\n – C\n\nv\n  = R\n\nwhere R is the universal gas constant.\n\n6. Equilibrium states of a thermodynamic system are described by state variables. The\nvalue of a state variable depends only on the particular state, not on the path used to\narrive at that state.  Examples of state variables are pressure (P ), volume (V ), temperature\n(T ), and mass (m ).  Heat and work are not state variables.  An Equation of State (like\nthe ideal gas equation PV  =  µ RT ) is a relation connecting different state variables.\n\n7. A quasi-static process is an infinitely slow process such that the system remains in\nthermal and mechanical equilibrium with the surroundings throughout. In a\nquasi-static process, the pressure and temperature of the environment can differ from\nthose of the system only infinitesimally.\n\n8. In an isothermal expansion of an ideal gas from volume V\n1\n to V\n\n2\n at temperature T the\n\nheat absorbed (Q) equals the work done (W ) by the gas, each given by\n\nQ  =  W  =   µ R T   ln \uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n\uf8eb\n\n1\n\n2\n\nV\n\nV\n\n9.

Heat engine is a device in which a system undergoes a cyclic process resulting in\n\nconversion of heat into work.

In a refrigerator or a heat pump, the system extracts heat Q\n2\n from the cold reservoir and\n\nreleases Q\n1\n amount of heat to the hot reservoir, with work W done on the system.

The second law of thermodynamics disallows some processes consistent with the First\nLaw of Thermodynamics. It states\n\nKelvin-Planck statement\n\nNo process is possible whose sole result is the absorption of heat from a reservoir and\ncomplete conversion of the heat into work.\n\nClausius statement\n\nNo process is possible whose sole result is the transfer of heat from a colder object to a\nhotter object.\n\nPut simply, the Second Law implies that no heat engine can have efficiency η equal to\n1 or no refrigerator can have co-efficient of performance α equal to infinity.\n\n13. A process is reversible if it can be reversed such that both the system and the surroundings\nreturn to their original states, with no other change anywhere else in the universe.\nSpontaneous processes of nature are irreversible. The idealised reversible process is a\nquasi-static process with no dissipative factors such as friction, viscosity, etc.\n\n14. Carnot engine is a reversible engine operating between two temperatures T\n1\n (source) and\n\nT\n2\n (sink).

Temperature of a body is related to its average internal energy, not to the kinetic energy\nof motion of its centre of mass. A bullet fired from a gun is not at a higher temperature\nbecause of its high speed.\n\n2. Equilibrium in thermodynamics refers to the situation when macroscopic variables\ndescribing the thermodynamic state of a system do not depend on time.  Equilibrium of\na system in mechanics means the net external force and torque on the system are zero.\n\n3. In a state of thermodynamic equilibrium, the microscopic constituents of a system are\nnot in equilibrium (in the sense of mechanics).\n\n4. Heat capacity, in general, depends on the process the system goes through when heat is\nsupplied.\n\n5. In isothermal quasi-static processes, heat is absorbed or given out by the system even\nthough at every stage the gas has the same temperature as that of the surrounding\nreservoir.  This is possible because of the infinitesimal difference in temperature between\n\nthe system and the reservoir.\n\nEXERCISES\n\n12.1 A geyser heats water flowing at the rate of 3.0 litres per minute from 27 °C to 77 °C.\nIf the geyser operates on a gas burner, what is the rate of consumption of the fuel if\nits heat of combustion is 4.0 × 10\n\n4\n J/g ?\n\n12.2 What amount of heat must be supplied to 2.0 × 10\n–2\n\n kg of nitrogen (at room\ntemperature) to raise its temperature by 45 °C at constant pressure ?
