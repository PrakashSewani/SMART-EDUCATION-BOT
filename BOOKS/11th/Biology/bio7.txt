In unicellular\n\norganisms, all functions like digestion, respiration and reproduction\n\nare performed by a single cell. In the complex body of multicellular\n\nanimals the same basic functions are carried out by different groups of\n\ncells in a well organised manner. The body of a simple organism like\n\nHydra is made of different types of cells and the number of cells in each\n\ntype can be in thousands. The human body is composed of billions of\n\ncells to perform various functions. How do these cells in the body work\n\ntogether? In multicellular animals, a group of similar cells alongwith\n\nintercellular substances perform a specific function. Such an organisation\n\nis called tissue.\n\nYou may be surprised to know that all complex animals consist of\n\nonly four basic types of tissues. These tissues are organised in specific\n\nproportion and pattern to form an organ like stomach, lung, heart and\n\nkidney. When two or more organs perform a common function by their\n\nphysical and/or chemical interaction, they together form organ system,\n\ne.g., digestive system, respiratory system, etc. Cells, tissues, organs and\n\norgan systems split up the work in a way that exhibits division of labour\n\nand contribute to the survival of the body as a whole.\n\n7.1 ANIMAL TISSUES\n\nThe structure of the cells vary according to their function. Therefore, the\n\ntissues are different and are broadly classified into four types : (i) Epithelial,\n\n(ii) Connective, (iii) Muscular and (iv) Neural.\n\nSTRUCTURAL ORGANISATION IN\nANIMALS\n\nCHAPTER  7\n\n7.1 Animal Tissues\n\n7.2 Organ and Organ\n\nSystem\n\n7.3 Earthworm\n\n7.4 Cockroach\n\n7.5 Frogs\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSTRUCTURAL ORGANISATION IN ANIMALS 101\n\n7.1.1 Epithelial Tissue\n\nWe commonly refer to an epithelial tissue as epithelium (pl.: epithelia).\n\nThis tissue has a free surface, which faces either a body fluid or the outside\n\nenvironment and thus provides a covering or a lining for some part of the\n\nbody. The cells are compactly packed with little intercellular matrix. There\n\nare two types of epithelial tissues namely simple epithelium and\n\ncompound epithelium.  Simple epithelium is composed of a single layer\n\nof cells and functions as a lining for body cavities, ducts, and tubes. The\n\ncompound epithelium consists of two or more cell layers and has protective\n\nfunction as it does in our skin.\n\nOn the basis of structural modification of the cells, simple epithelium\n\nis further divided into three types. These are (i) Squamous, (ii) Cuboidal,\n\n(iii) Columnar (Figure 7.1).\n\nThe squamous epithelium is made of a single thin layer of flattened\n\ncells with irregular boundaries. They are found in the walls of blood vessels\n\nand air sacs of lungs and are involved in functions like forming a diffusion\n\nboundary. The cuboidal epithelium is composed of a single layer of\n\ncube-like cells. This is commonly found in ducts of glands and tubular\n\nparts of nephrons in kidneys and its main functions are secretion and\n\nabsorption. The epithelium of proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) of\n\nnephron in the kidney has microvilli. The columnar epithelium is\n\ncomposed of a single layer of tall and slender cells. Their nuclei are located\n\nat the base. Free surface may have microvilli. They are found in the lining\n\nof stomach and intestine and help in secretion and absorption. If the\n\ncolumnar or cuboidal cells bear cilia on their free surface they are called\n\nciliated epithelium (Figure 7.1d). Their function is to move particles or\n\nmucus in a specific direction over the epithelium. They are mainly present\n\nin the inner surface of hollow organs like bronchioles and fallopian tubes.\n\nFigure 7.1 Simple epithelium: (a) Squamous (b) Cuboidal (c) Columnar\n(d) Columnar cells bearing cilia\n\n(a)\nFlattened cell\n\nCube-like cell\n\nTall cell\n\n(b)\n\n(d)\n(c)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n102 BIOLOGY\n\nSome of the columnar or cuboidal cells\n\nget specialised for secretion and are called\n\nglandular epithelium (Figure 7.2). They\n\nare mainly of two types: unicellular,\n\nconsisting of isolated glandular cells (goblet\n\ncells of the alimentary canal), and\n\nmulticellular, consisting of cluster of cells\n\n(salivary gland). On the basis of the mode of\n\npouring of their secretions, glands are\n\ndivided into two categories namely\n\nexocrine and endocrine glands. Exocrine\n\nglands secrete mucus, saliva, earwax, oil,\n\nmilk, digestive enzymes and other cell\n\nproducts. These products are released\n\nthrough ducts or tubes. In contrast,\n\nendocrine glands do not have ducts. Their\n\nproducts called hormones are secreted\n\ndirectly into the fluid bathing the gland.\n\nCompound epithelium is made of more\n\nthan one layer (multi-layered) of cells and thus\n\nhas a limited role in secretion and absorption\n\n(Figure 7.3). Their main function is to provide\n\nprotection against chemical and mechanical\n\nstresses. They cover the dry surface of the skin,\n\nthe moist surface of buccal cavity, pharynx,\n\ninner lining of ducts of salivary glands and of\n\npancreatic ducts.\n\nAll cells in epithelium are held together with little intercellular material.\n\nIn nearly all animal tissues, specialised junctions provide both structural\n\nand functional links between its individual cells. Three types of cell junctions\n\nare found in the epithelium and other tissues. These are called as tight,\n\nadhering and gap junctions. Tight junctions help to stop substances\n\nfrom leaking across a tissue. Adhering junctions perform cementing to\n\nkeep neighbouring cells together. Gap junctions facilitate the cells to\n\ncommunicate with each other by connecting the cytoplasm of adjoining\n\ncells, for rapid transfer of ions, small molecules and sometimes big molecules.\n\n7.1.2 Connective Tissue\n\nConnective tissues are most abundant and widely distributed in the body\n\nof complex animals. They are named connective tissues because of their\n\nspecial function of linking and supporting other tissues/organs of the\n\nbody. They range from soft connective tissues to specialised types, which\n\nFigure 7.2 Glandular epithelium : (a) Unicellular\n(b) Multicellular\n\nunicellular\ngland\n\nMulticelluar\ngland\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 7.3 Compound epithelium\n\nMulti-\nlayered\ncells\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSTRUCTURAL ORGANISATION IN ANIMALS 103\n\nFat storage\narea\n\nNucleus\n\nMacro-\nphage\n\nMast\ncell\n\nFibroblast\n\nCollagen\nfibers\n\nPlasma\nMembrane\n\ninclude cartilage, bone, adipose, and blood. In all\n\nconnective tissues except blood, the cells secrete fibres of\n\nstructural proteins called collagen or elastin. The fibres\n\nprovide strength, elasticity and flexibility to the tissue.\n\nThese cells also secrete modified polysaccharides, which\n\naccumulate between cells and fibres and act as\n\nmatrix (ground substance). Connective tissues are\n\nclassified into three types: (i) Loose connective tissue,\n\n(ii) Dense connective tissue and (iii) Specialised\n\nconnective tissue.\n\nLoose connective tissue has cells and fibres loosely\n\narranged in a semi-fluid ground substance, for example,\n\nareolar tissue present beneath the skin (Figure 7.4). Often\n\nit serves as a support framework for epithelium. It\n\ncontains fibroblasts (cells that produce and secrete fibres),\n\nmacrophages and mast cells. Adipose tissue is another\n\ntype of loose connective tissue located mainly beneath the\n\nskin. The cells of this tissue are specialised to store fats.\n\nThe excess of nutrients which are not used immediately\n\nare converted into fats and are stored in this tissue.\n\nFibres and fibroblasts are compactly packed in the\n\ndense connective tissues. Orientation of fibres show a\n\nregular or irregular pattern and are called dense regular\n\nand dense irregular tissues. In the dense regular\n\nconnective tissues, the collagen fibres are present in rows\n\nbetween many parallel bundles of fibres. Tendons, which\n\nattach skeletal muscles to bones and ligaments which\n\nattach one bone to another are examples of this tissue.\n\nDense irregular connective tissue has fibroblasts and\n\nmany fibres (mostly collagen) that are oriented differently\n\n(Figure 7.5). This tissue is present in the skin. Cartilage,\n\nFigure 7.4 Loose connective tissue : (a) Areolar tissue  (b) Adipose tissue\n\n(a)\n(b)\n\nfibres\n\nCollagen fibre\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 7.5 Dense connective tissue:\n(a) Dense regular\n(b) Dense irregular\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n104 BIOLOGY\n\nbones and blood are various types of specialised\n\nconnective tissues.\n\nThe intercellular material of cartilage is solid and pliable\n\nand resists compression. Cells of this tissue (chondrocytes)\n\nare enclosed in small cavities within the matrix secreted by\n\nthem (Figure 7.6a). Most of the cartilages in vertebrate\n\nembryos are replaced by bones in adults. Cartilage is\n\npresent in the tip of nose, outer ear joints, between adjacent\n\nbones of the vertebral column, limbs and hands in adults.\n\nBones have a hard and non-pliable ground substance\n\nrich in calcium salts and collagen fibres which give bone\n\nits strength (Figure 7.6b). It is the main tissue that provides\n\nstructural frame to the body. Bones support and protect\n\nsofter tissues and organs. The bone cells (osteocytes) are\n\npresent in the  spaces called lacunae. Limb bones, such as\n\nthe long bones of the legs, serve weight-bearing functions.\n\nThey also interact with skeletal muscles attached to them\n\nto bring about movements. The bone marrow in some bones\n\nis the site of production of blood cells.\n\nBlood is a fluid connective tissue containing plasma,\n\nred blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC) and platelets\n\n(Figure 7.6c). It is the main circulating fluid that helps in\n\nthe transport of various substances. You will learn more\n\nabout blood in Chapters 17 and 18.\n\n7.1.3 Muscle Tissue\n\nEach muscle is made of many long, cylindrical fibres\n\narranged in parallel arrays. These fibres are composed of\n\nnumerous fine fibrils, called myofibrils. Muscle fibres\n\ncontract (shorten) in response to stimulation, then relax\n\n(lengthen) and return to their uncontracted state in a\n\ncoordinated fashion. Their action moves the body to adjust\n\nto the changes in the environment and to maintain the\n\npositions of the various parts of the body. In general,\n\nmuscles play an active role in all the movements of the body.\n\nMuscles are of three types, skeletal, smooth, and cardiac.\n\nSkeletal muscle tissue is closely attached to skeletal\n\nbones. In a typical muscle such as the biceps, striated\n\n(striped) skeletal muscle fibres are bundled together in a\n\nparallel fashion (Figure 7.7a). A sheath of tough connective\n\ntissue encloses several bundles of muscle fibres (You will\n\nlearn more about this in Chapter 20).\n\nPlatelets\n\nWBC\n\nRBC\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 7.6 Specialised connective\ntissues : (a) Cartilage\n(b) Bone  (c) Blood\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSTRUCTURAL ORGANISATION IN ANIMALS 105\n\nThe smooth muscle fibres taper at both ends (fusiform) and do not\n\nshow striations (Figure 7.7b). Cell junctions hold them together and they\n\nare bundled together in a connective tissue sheath. The wall of internal\n\norgans such as the blood vessels, stomach and intestine contains this type\n\nof muscle tissue. Smooth muscles are ‘involuntary’ as their functioning\n\ncannot be directly controlled. We usually are not able to make it contract\n\nmerely by thinking about it as we can do with skeletal muscles.\n\nCardiac muscle tissue is a contractile tissue present only in the heart.\n\nCell junctions fuse the plasma membranes of cardiac muscle cells and\n\nmake them stick together (Figure 7.7c). Communication junctions\n\n(intercalated discs) at some fusion points allow the cells to contract as a\n\nunit, i.e., when one cell receives a signal to contract, its neighbours are\n\nalso stimulated to contract.\n\n7.1.4 Neural Tissue\n\nNeural tissue exerts the greatest control over\n\nthe body’s responsiveness to changing\n\nconditions. Neurons, the unit of neural\n\nsystem are excitable cells (Figure 7.8). The\n\nneuroglial cell which constitute the rest of\n\nthe neural system protect and support\n\nneurons. Neuroglia make up more than one-\n\nhalf the volume of neural tissue in our body.\n\nWhen a neuron is suitably stimulated,\n\nan electrical disturbance is generated\n\nwhich swiftly travels along its plasma\n\nNucleus\n\nStriations\n\nJunction\nbetween\nadjacent\n\ncells\n\nNucleus\n\nStriationsSmooth\nmuscle\nfibers\n\nFigure 7.7 Muscle tissue : (a) Skeletal (striated) muscle tissue (b) Smooth muscle tissue\n(c) Cardiac muscle tissue\n\n(a) (b) (c)\n\nFigure 7.8 Neural tissue (Neuron with\nneuroglea)\n\nDendrite\n\nCell\nbody\nwith\n\nnucleus\n\nAxon\n\nNeuroglea\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n106 BIOLOGY\n\nmembrane. Arrival of the disturbance at the neuron’s endings, or output\n\nzone, triggers events that may cause stimulation or inhibition of adjacent\n\nneurons and other cells (You will study the details in Chapter 21).\n\n7.2 ORGAN AND ORGAN SYSTEM\n\nThe basic tissues mentioned above organise to form organs which in turn\n\nassociate to form organ systems in the multicellular organisms. Such an\n\norganisation is essential for more efficient and better coordinated activities\n\nof millions of cells constituting an organism. Each organ in our body is\n\nmade of one or more type of tissues. For example, our heart consists of all\n\nthe four types of tissues, i.e., epithelial, connective, muscular and neural.\n\nWe also notice, after some careful study that the complexity in organ and\n\norgan systems displays certain discernable trend. This discernable trend\n\nis called evolutionary trend (You will study the details in class XII). You\n\nare being introduced to morphology and anatomy of three organisms at\n\ndifferent evolutionary levels to show their organisation and functioning.\n\nMorphology refers to study of form or externally visible features. In the\n\ncase of plants or microbes, the term morphology precisely means only\n\nthis. In case of animals this refers to the external appearance of the organs\n\nor parts of the body. The word anatomy conventionally is used for the\n\nstudy of morphology of internal organs in the animals. You will learn the\n\nmorphology and anatomy of earthworm, cockroach and frog representing\n\ninvertebrates and vertebrates.\n\n7.3 EARTHWORM\n\nEarthworm is a reddish brown terrestrial invertebrate that inhabits the\n\nupper layer of the  moist soil. During day time, they live in burrows made\n\nby boring and swallowing the soil. In the gardens, they can be traced by\n\ntheir faecal deposits known as worm castings. The common Indian\n\nearthworms are Pheretima  and Lumbricus.\n\n7.3.1 Morphology\n\nEarthworms have long cylindrical body. The body is divided into more\n\nthan hundred short segments which are similar (metameres about\n\n100-120 in number). The dorsal surface of the body is marked by a dark\n\nmedian mid dorsal line (dorsal blood vessel) along the longitudinal axis of\n\nthe body. The ventral surface is distinguished by the presence of genital\n\nopenings (pores). Anterior end consists of the mouth and the prostomium,\n\na lobe which serves as a covering for the mouth and as a wedge to force\n\nopen cracks in the soil into which the earthworm may crawl. The prostomium\n\nis sensory in function. The first body segment is called the peristomium\n\n(buccal segment) which contains the mouth. In a mature worm, segments\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSTRUCTURAL ORGANISATION IN ANIMALS 107\n\n14-16 are covered by a prominent dark band of glandular tissue called\n\nclitellum. Thus the body is divisible into three prominent regions –\n\npreclitellar, clitellar and postclitellar segments (Figure 7.9).\n\nFour pairs of spermathecal apertures are situated on the ventro-lateral\n\nsides of the intersegmental  grooves, i.e., 5th -9th  segments. A single female\n\ngenital pore is present in the mid-ventral line of 14th segment. A pair of\n\nmale genital pores are present on the ventro-lateral sides of the 18th\n\nsegment. Numerous minute pores called nephridiopores open on the\n\nsurface of the body. In each body segment, except the first, last and\n\nclitellum, there are rows of S-shaped setae, embedded in the epidermal\n\npits in the middle of each segment. Setae can be extended or retracted.\n\nTheir principal role is in locomotion.\n\n7.3.2 Anatomy\n\nThe body wall of the earthworm is covered externally by a thin non-cellular\n\ncuticle below which is the epidermis, two muscle layers (circular and\n\nlongitudinal) and an innermost coelomic epithelium. The epidermis is made\n\nFigure 7.9 Body of earthworm : (a) dorsal view (b) ventral view (c) lateral view\nshowing mouth opening\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n108 BIOLOGY\n\nup of a single layer of columnar epithelial cells\n\nwhich contain secretory gland cells.\n\nThe alimentary canal is a straight tube and\n\nruns between first to last segment of the body.\n\n(Figure 7.10). A terminal mouth opens into the\n\nbuccal cavity (1-3 segments) which leads into\n\nmuscular pharynx. A small narrow tube,\n\noesophagus (5-7 segments), continues into a\n\nmuscular gizzard (8-9 segments). It helps in\n\ngrinding the soil particles and decaying leaves,\n\netc. The stomach extends from 9-14 segments.\n\nThe food of the earthworm is decaying leaves and\n\norganic matter mixed with soil. Calciferous\n\nglands, present in the stomach, neutralise the\n\nhumic acid present in humus. Intestine starts\n\nfrom the 15th segment onwards and continues\n\ntill the last segment. A pair of short and conical\n\nintestinal caecae project from the intestine on the\n\n26th segment. The characteristic feature of the\n\nintestine after 26th segment except the last\n\n23rd-25th segments is the presence of internal\n\nmedian fold of dorsal wall called typhlosole. This\n\nincreases the effective area of absorption in the\n\nintestine. The alimentary canal opens to the\n\nexterior by a small rounded aperture called anus.\n\nThe ingested organic rich soil passes through the\n\ndigestive tract where digestive enzymes\n\nbreakdown complex food into smaller absorbable\n\nunits. These simpler molecules are absorbed\n\nthrough intestinal membranes and are utilised.\n\nPheretima  exhibits a closed type of\n\nblood vascular system, consisting of blood\n\nvessels, capillaries and heart. (Figure 7.11). Due\n\nto closed circulatory system, blood is confined\n\nto the heart and blood vessels. Contractions\n\nkeep blood circulating in one direction. Smaller\n\nblood vessels supply the gut, nerve cord, and\n\nthe body wall. Blood glands are present on the\n\n4th, 5th and 6th segments. They produce blood\n\ncells and haemoglobin which is dissolved in\n\nblood plasma. Blood cells are phagocytic in\n\nnature. Earthworms lack specialised breathing\n\ndevices. Respiratory exchange occurs through\n\nmoist body surface into their blood stream.\n\nMouth\n\nPharynx\n\nOesophagus\n\nGizzard\n\nStomach\n\nPre-typhlosolar\npart of intestine\n\nIntestinal\ncaecum\n\nLymph gland\n\nTyphlosolar\npart of intestine\n\nIntestinal lumen\n\nTyphlosole\n\n1\n2\n\n3\n4\n\n5\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n16\n17\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n28\n\n29\n\n30\n\n31\n\n32\n33\n\n34\n\nFigure 7.10  Alimentary canal of earthworm\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSTRUCTURAL ORGANISATION IN ANIMALS 109\n\nThe excretory organs occur as segmentally\n\narranged coiled tubules called nephridia\n\n(sing.: nephridium). They are of three types:\n\n(i) septal nephridia, present on both the sides of\n\nintersegmental septa of segment 15 to the last\n\nthat open into intestine, (ii) integumentary\n\nnephridia, attached to lining of the body wall of\n\nsegment 3 to the last that open on the body\n\nsurface and (iii) pharyngeal  nephridia, present\n\nas  three paired tufts in the 4th, 5th and 6th\n\nsegments (Figure 7.12). These different types of\n\nnephridia are basically similar in structure.\n\nNephridia regulate the volume and composition\n\nof the body fluids. A nephridium  starts out as a\n\nfunnel that collects excess fluid from coelomic\n\nchamber. The funnel connects with a tubular part\n\nof the nephridium which delivers the wastes\n\nthrough a pore to the surface in the body wall\n\ninto the digestive tube.\n\nNervous system is basically represented by\n\nganglia arranged segmentwise on the ventral\n\npaired nerve cord. The nerve cord in the anterior\n\nregion (3rd  and 4th  segments) bifurcates, laterally\n\nencircling the pharynx and joins the cerebral\n\nganglia dorsally to form a nerve ring. The cerebral\n\nganglia alongwith other nerves in the ring\n\nintegrate sensory input as well as command\n\nmuscular responses of the body.\n\nFigure 7.11 Closed circulatory system\n\nFigure 7.12 Nephridial system in earthworm\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n110 BIOLOGY\n\nSensory system does not have eyes but does\n\npossess light and touch sensitive organs (receptor\n\ncells) to distinguish the light intensities and to feel\n\nthe vibrations in the ground. Worms have\n\nspecialised chemoreceptors (taste receptors) which\n\nreact to chemical stimuli. These sense organs are\n\nlocated on the anterior part of the worm.\n\nEarthworm is hermaphrodite (bisexual), i.e.,\n\ntestes and ovaries are present in the same\n\nindividual (Figure 7.13). There are two pairs of\n\ntestes present in the 10th and 11th segments.\n\nTheir vasa deferentia run up to  the 18th segment\n\nwhere they join the prostatic duct. Two pairs of\n\naccessory glands are present one pair each in\n\nthe 17th and 19th segments. The common prostate\n\nand spermatic duct (vasa deferentia) opens to\n\nthe exterior by a pair of male genital pores on\n\nthe ventro-lateral side of the 18th segment. Four\n\npairs of spermathecae are located in 6th-9th\n\nsegments (one pair in each segment). They receive\n\nand store spermatozoa during copulation. One\n\npair of ovaries is attached at the inter-segmental\n\nseptum of the 12th and 13th segments. Ovarian\n\nfunnels are present beneath the ovaries which\n\ncontinue into oviduct, join together and open on\n\nthe ventral side as a single median female genital\n\npore on the 14th segment.\n\nA mutual exchange of sperm occurs between\n\ntwo worms during mating. One worm has to find\n\nanother worm and they mate juxtaposing\n\nopposite gonadal openings exchanging packets\n\nof sperms called spermatophores. Mature sperm\n\nand egg cells and nutritive fluid are deposited in\n\ncocoons produced by the gland cells of clitellum.\n\nFertilisation and development occur within the\n\ncocoons which are deposited in soil. The ova\n\n(eggs) are fertilised by the sperm cells within the\n\ncocoon which then slips off the worm and is\n\ndeposited in or on the soil. The cocoon holds the\n\nworm embryos. After about 3 weeks, each cocoon\n\nproduces two to twenty baby worms with an\n\naverage of four. Development of earthworms is\n\ndirect, i.e., there is no larva formed.\n\nFigure 7.13  Reproductive system of earthworm\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSTRUCTURAL ORGANISATION IN ANIMALS 111\n\nEarthworms are known as ‘friends of farmers’ because they make\n\nburrows in the soil and make it porous which helps in respiration and\n\npenetration of the developing plant roots. The process of increasing fertility\n\nof soil by the earthworms is called vermicomposting. They are also used\n\nas bait in game fishing.\n\n7.4 COCKROACH\n\nCockroaches are brown or black bodied animals that are included in\n\nclass Insecta of Phylum Arthropoda. Bright yellow, red and green coloured\n\ncockroaches have also been reported in tropical regions. Their size ranges\n\nfrom ¼ inches to 3 inches (0.6-7.6 cm) and have long antenna, legs and\n\nflat extension of the upper body wall that conceals head. They are\n\nnocturnal omnivores that live in damp places throughout the world. They\n\nhave become residents of human homes and thus are serious pests and\n\nvectors of several diseases.\n\n7.4.1 Morphology\n\nThe adults of the common species of cockroach, Periplaneta americana\n\nare about 34-53 mm long with wings that extend beyond the tip of the\n\nabdomen in males. The body of the cockroach is segmented and divisible\n\ninto three distinct regions – head, thorax and abdomen (Figure 7.14).\n\nThe entire body is covered by a hard chitinous exoskeleton (brown in\n\ncolour). In each segment, exoskeleton has hardened plates called sclerites\n\n(tergites dorsally and sternites ventrally) that are joined to each other by\n\na thin and flexible articular membrane (arthrodial membrane).\n\nFigure 7.14  External features of cockroach\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n112 BIOLOGY\n\nHead is triangular in shape and lies anteriorly at right angles to the\n\nlongitudinal body axis. It is formed by the fusion of  six segments and\n\nshows great mobility in all directions due to flexible neck (Figure 7.15).\n\nThe head capsule bears a pair of compound eyes. A pair of  thread like\n\nantennae arise from membranous sockets lying in front of eyes. Antennae\n\nhave sensory receptors that help in monitoring the environment. Anterior\n\nend of the head bears appendages forming biting and chewing type of\n\nmouth parts. The mouthparts consisting of  a labrum (upper lip), a pair\n\nof mandibles, a pair of maxillae and a labium (lower lip). A median flexible\n\nlobe, acting as tongue (hypopharynx), lies within the cavity enclosed by\n\nthe mouthparts (Figure 7.15b). Thorax consists of three parts – prothorax,\n\nmesothorax and metathorax.  The head is connected with thorax  by a\n\nshort extension of the prothorax known as the neck. Each thoracic segment\n\nbears a pair of walking legs. The first pair of wings arises from mesothorax\n\nand the second pair from metathorax. Forewings (mesothoracic) called\n\ntegmina are opaque dark and  leathery and cover the hind wings when at\n\nrest. The hind wings are transparent, membranous and are used in flight.\n\nThe abdomen in both males and females consists of 10 segments. In\n\nfemales,  the 7th sternum is boat shaped and together with the 8th and 9th\n\nsterna forms a brood or genital pouch whose anterior part contains female\n\ngonopore, spermathecal pores and collateral glands. In males, genital pouch\n\nor chamber lies at the hind end of abdomen bounded dorsally by 9th and\n\n10th terga and ventrally by the 9th sternum. It contains dorsal anus, ventral\n\nmale genital pore and gonapophysis. Males bear a pair of short, thread-\n\nlike anal styles which are absent in females. In both sexes, the 10th segment\n\nbears a pair of jointed filamentous structures called anal cerci.\n\nOcellus\nCompound eye\n\nMandible\n\nMaxilla\n\nLabrum\n\nLabium(a)\n\nFigure 7.15  Head region of cockroach :  (a) parts of head region  (b) mouth parts\n\nGrinding\nregion\n\nIncising\nregionMandible\n\nMaxilla\n\nLabrum\n\nHypopharynx\n\nLabium\n\nMandible\n\nMaxilla\n\n(b)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSTRUCTURAL ORGANISATION IN ANIMALS 113\n\n7.4.2 Anatomy\n\nThe alimentary canal present in the body cavity\n\nis divided into three regions: foregut, midgut\n\nand hindgut (Figure 7.16). The mouth opens\n\ninto a short tubular pharynx, leading to a\n\nnarrow tubular passage called oesophagus.\n\nThis in turn opens into a sac like structure\n\ncalled crop used for storing of food. The crop\n\nis followed by gizzard or proventriculus. It has\n\nan outer layer of thick circular muscles and\n\nthick inner cuticle forming six highly chitinous\n\nplate called teeth. Gizzard helps in grinding the\n\nfood particles. The entire foregut is lined by\n\ncuticle. A ring of 6-8 blind tubules called\n\nhepatic or gastric caeca is present at the\n\njunction of foregut and midgut, which secrete\n\ndigestive juice. At the junction of midgut and\n\nhindgut is present another ring of 100-150\n\nyellow coloured thin filamentous Malpighian\n\ntubules. They help in removal of excretory\n\nproducts from haemolymph. The hindgut is\n\nbroader than midgut and is differentiated into\n\nileum, colon and rectum. The rectum opens\n\nout through anus.\n\nBlood vascular system of cockroach is an\n\nopen type (Figure 7.17). Blood vessels are\n\npoorly developed and open into space\n\n(haemocoel). Visceral organs located in the\n\nhaemocoel are bathed in blood (haemolymph).\n\nThe haemolymph is composed of colourless\n\nplasma and haemocytes. Heart of cockroach\n\nconsists of elongated muscular tube lying\n\nalong mid dorsal line of thorax and abdomen.\n\nIt is differentiated into funnel shaped chambers\n\nwith ostia on either side. Blood from sinuses\n\nenter heart through ostia and is pumped\n\nanteriorly to sinuses again.\n\nThe respiratory system consists of a\n\nnetwork of trachea, that open through 10 pairs\n\nof small holes called spiracles present on the\n\nlateral side of the body. Thin branching tubes\n\n(tracheal tubes subdivided into tracheoles)\n\ncarry oxygen from the air to all the parts.

Exchange of gases\n\ntake place at the tracheoles by diffusion.\n\nExcretion is performed by Malpighian tubules. Each tubule is lined\n\nby glandular and ciliated cells. They absorb nitrogenous waste products\n\nand convert them into uric acid which is excreted out through the hindgut.\n\nTherefore, this insect is called uricotelic. In addition, the fat body,\n\nnephrocytes and urecose glands also help in excretion.\n\nThe nervous system of cockroach consists of a series of fused,\n\nsegmentally arranged ganglia joined by paired longitudinal connectives\n\non the ventral side. Three ganglia lie in the thorax, and six in the abdomen.\n\nThe nervous system of cockroach is spread throughout the body. The\n\nhead holds a bit of a nervous system while the rest is situated along the\n\nventral (belly-side) part of its body. So, now you understand that if the\n\nhead of a cockroach is cut off, it will still live for as long as one week. In\n\nthe head region, the brain is represented by supra-oesophageal ganglion\n\nwhich supplies nerves to antennae and compound eyes. In cockroach,\n\nthe sense organs are antennae, eyes, maxillary palps, labial palps, anal\n\ncerci, etc. The compound eyes are situated at the dorsal surface of the\n\nhead. Each eye consists of about 2000 hexagonal ommatidia\n\n(sing.: ommatidium). With the help of several ommatidia, a cockroach can\n\nreceive several images of an object. This kind of vision is known as mosaic\n\nvision with more sensitivity but less resolution, being common during\n\nnight (hence called nocturnal vision).\n\nCockroaches are dioecious and both sexes have well developed\n\nreproductive organs (Figure 7.18). Male reproductive system consists of\n\na pair of testes one lying on each lateral side in the 4th -6th  abdominal\n\nsegments. From each testis arises a thin vas deferens, which opens into\n\nejaculatory duct through seminal vesicle. The ejaculatory duct opens into\n\nmale gonopore situated ventral to anus. A characteristic  mushroom-\n\nshaped gland is present in the 6th-7th abdominal segments which functions\n\nas an accessory reproductive gland. The external genitalia are represented\n\nby male gonapophysis or phallomere (chitinous asymmetrical structures,\n\nsurrounding the male gonopore). The sperms are stored in the seminal\n\nvesicles and are glued together in the form of bundles called\n\nspermatophores which are discharged during copulation. The female\n\nreproductive sysytem consists of two large ovaries,  lying laterally in the\n\n2nd – 6th abdominal segments. Each ovary is formed of a group of eight\n\novarian tubules or ovarioles, containing a chain of developing ova.\n\nOviducts of each ovary unite into a single median oviduct (also called\n\nvagina) which opens into the genital chamber. A pair of spermatheca is\n\npresent in the 6th segment which opens into the genital chamber.\n\nSperms are transferred through spermatophores. Their fertilised eggs\n\nare encased in capsules called oothecae. Ootheca is a dark reddish to\n\nblackish brown capsule, about 3/8" (8 mm) long. They are dropped or\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSTRUCTURAL ORGANISATION IN ANIMALS 115\n\nglued to a suitable surface, usually in a crack or crevice of high relative\n\nhumidity near a food source. On an average, females produce 9-10\n\noothecae, each containing 14-16 eggs. The development of P. americana\n\nis paurometabolous, meaning there is development through nymphal\n\nstage. The nymphs look very much like adults. The nymph grows by\n\nmoulting about 13 times to reach the adult form. The next to last nymphal\n\nstage has wing pads but only adult cockroaches have wings.\n\nMany species of cockroaches are wild and are of no known economic\n\nimportance yet. A few species thrive in and around human habitat. They are\n\npests because they spoil food and contaminate it with their smelly excreta.\n\nThey can transmit a variety of bacterial diseases by contaminating food material.\n\nTestis\n\nPhallic gland\n\nSmall tubules\n\nLong tubules\n\nSeminal vesicle\n\nVas deferens\n\nEjaculatory duct\n\nRight phallomere\n\nVentral phallomere\n\nAnal cercus\n\nCaudal style\nPseudopenis\n\nTitillator\n\nLeft phallomere\n\nOvary\n\nOviduct\n\nCommon oviduct\nor vagina\n\nCollaterial glands\n\nGenital chamber\n\nVestibulum\n\nGenital\npouch\n\nSpermatheca\n\ngonapophyses\n]\n\nFigure 7.18  Reproductive system of cockroach :  (a) male  (b) female\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n116 BIOLOGY\n\n7.5 FROGS\n\nFrogs can live both on land and in freshwater and belong to class\n\nAmphibia of phylum Chordata. The most common species of frog found\n\nin India is Rana tigrina.\n\nThey do not have constant body temperature i.e., their body\n\ntemperature varies with the temperature of the environment. Such animals\n\nare called cold blooded or poikilotherms. You might have also noticed\n\nchanges in the colour of the frogs while they are in grasses and on dry\n\nland. They have the ability to change the colour to hide them from their\n\nenemies (camouflage). This protective coloration is called mimicry.  You\n\nmay also know that frogs are not seen during peak summer and winter.\n\nDuring this period they take shelter in deep burrows to protect them\n\nfrom extreme heat and cold. This is known as summer sleep (aestivation)\n\nand winter sleep (hibernation) respectively.\n\n7.5.1 Morphology\n\nHave you ever touched the skin of frog? The skin is smooth and slippery\n\ndue to the presence of mucus. The skin is always maintained in a moist\n\ncondition. The colour of dorsal side of body is generally olive green with\n\ndark irregular spots.  On the ventral side the skin is uniformly pale yellow.\n\nThe frog never drinks water but absorb it through the skin.\n\nBody of a frog is divisible into head and trunk (Figure 7.19). A neck\n\nand tail are absent. Above the mouth, a pair of nostrils is present.  Eyes\n\nare bulged and covered by a nictitating membrane that protects them\n\nwhile in water. On either side of eyes a membranous\n\ntympanum (ear) receives sound signals. The\n\nforelimbs and hind limbs help in swimming,\n\nwalking, leaping and burrowing. The hind limbs end\n\nin five digits and they are larger and muscular than\n\nfore limbs that end in four digits. Feet have webbed\n\ndigits that help in swimming. Frogs exhibit sexual\n\ndimorphism. Male frogs can be distinguished by the\n\npresence of sound producing vocal sacs and also a\n\ncopulatory pad on the first digit of the fore limbs\n\nwhich are absent in female frogs.\n\n7.5.2 Anatomy\n\nThe body cavity of frogs accommodate different organ systems such as\n\ndigestive, circulatory, respiratory, nervous, excretory and reproductive\n\nsystems with well developed structures and functions  (Figure 7.20).\n\nThe digestive system consists of alimentary canal and digestive glands.\n\nThe alimentary canal is short because frogs are carnivores and hence the\n\nlength of intestine is reduced. The mouth opens into the buccal cavity that\n\nFigure 7.19  External features of frog\n\nEye\n\nFore limb\n\nHind limb\n\nHead\nTrunk\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSTRUCTURAL ORGANISATION IN ANIMALS 117\n\nleads to the oesophagus through pharynx. Oesophagus is a short tube\n\nthat opens into the stomach which in turn continues as the intestine, rectum\n\nand finally opens outside by the cloaca.  Liver secretes bile that is stored in\n\nthe gall bladder. Pancreas, a digestive gland produces pancreatic juice\n\ncontaining digestive enzymes. Food is captured by the bilobed tongue.\n\nDigestion of food takes place by the action of HCl and gastric juices secreted\n\nfrom  the walls of the stomach. Partially digested food called chyme is passed\n\nfrom stomach to the first part of the small intestine, the duodenum. The\n\nduodenum receives bile from gall bladder and pancreatic juices from the\n\npancreas through a common bile duct. Bile emulsifies fat and pancreatic\n\njuices digest carbohydrates and proteins. Final digestion takes place in the\n\nintestine. Digested food is absorbed by the numerous finger-like folds in\n\nthe inner wall of intestine called villi and microvilli. The undigested solid\n\nwaste moves into the rectum and passes out through cloaca.\n\nFrogs respire on land and in the water by two different methods. In\n\nwater, skin acts as aquatic respiratory organ (cutaneous respiration).\n\nDissolved oxygen in the water is exchanged through the skin by diffusion.\n\nFigure 7.20 Diagrammatic representation of internal organs of frog showing\ncomplete digestive system\n\nIntestineUreter\n\nRectum\n\nCloaca\n\nUrinary\nbladder\n\nOesophagus\n\nLiver\n\nStomach\n\nKidney\n\nGall\nbladder\n\nFat bodies\n\nLung\n\nHeart\n\nCloacal Aperture\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n118 BIOLOGY\n\nOn land, the buccal cavity, skin and lungs act as the respiratory organs.\n\nThe respiration by lungs is called pulmonary respiration. The lungs are\n\na pair of elongated, pink coloured sac-like structures present in the upper\n\npart of the trunk region (thorax). Air enters through the nostrils into the\n\nbuccal cavity and then to lungs. During aestivation and hibernation\n\ngaseous exchange takes place through skin.\n\nThe vascular system of frog is well-developed closed type. Frogs have\n\na lymphatic system also. The blood vascular system involves heart, blood\n\nvessels and blood. The lymphatic system consists of lymph, lymph\n\nchannels and lymph nodes. Heart is a muscular structure situated in the\n\nupper part of the body cavity. It has three chambers, two atria and one\n\nventricle and is covered by a membrane called pericardium. A triangular\n\nstructure called sinus venosus joins the right atrium. It receives blood\n\nthrough the major veins called vena cava. The ventricle opens into a sac-\n\nlike conus arteriosus on the ventral side of the heart. The blood from the\n\nheart is carried to all parts of the body by the arteries (arterial system).\n\nThe veins collect blood from different parts of body to the heart and form\n\nthe venous system. Special venous connection between liver and intestine\n\nas well as the kidney and lower parts of the body are present in frogs. The\n\nformer is called hepatic portal system and the latter is called renal portal\n\nsystem. The blood is composed of plasma and cells. The blood cells are\n\nRBC (red blood cells) or erythrocytes, WBC (white blood cells) or leucocytes\n\nand platelets. RBC’s are nucleated and contain red coloured pigment\n\nnamely haemoglobin. The lymph is different from blood. It lacks few\n\nproteins and RBCs. The blood carries nutrients, gases and water to the\n\nrespective sites during the circulation. The circulation of blood is achieved\n\nby the pumping action of the muscular heart.\n\nThe elimination of nitrogenous wastes is carried out by a well\n\ndeveloped excretory system. The excretory system consists of a pair of\n\nkidneys, ureters, cloaca and urinary bladder. These are compact, dark\n\nred and bean like structures situated a little posteriorly in the body cavity\n\non both sides of vertebral column. Each kidney is composed of several\n\nstructural and functional units called uriniferous tubules or nephrons.\n\nTwo ureters emerge from the kidneys in the male frogs. The ureters act as\n\nurinogenital duct which opens into the cloaca. In females the ureters and\n\noviduct open seperately in the cloaca. The thin-walled urinary bladder is\n\npresent ventral to the rectum which also opens in the cloaca. The frog\n\nexcretes urea and thus is a ureotelic animal. Excretory wastes are carried\n\nby blood into the kidney where it is separated and excreted.\n\nThe system for control and coordination is highly evolved in the frog. It\n\nincludes both neural system and endocrine glands. The chemical\n\ncoordination of various organs of the body is achieved by hormones which\n\nare secreted by the endocrine glands. The prominent endocrine glands\n\nfound in frog are pituitary, thyroid, parathyroid, thymus, pineal body,\n\npancreatic islets, adrenals and gonads. The nervous system is organised\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSTRUCTURAL ORGANISATION IN ANIMALS 119\n\ninto a central nervous system (brain and spinal\n\ncord), a peripheral nervous system (cranial and\n\nspinal nerves) and an autonomic nervous system\n\n(sympathetic and parasympathetic). There are ten\n\npairs of cranial nerves arising from the brain. Brain\n\nis enclosed in a bony structure called brain box\n\n(cranium). The brain is divided into fore-brain,\n\nmid-brain and hind-brain. Forebrain includes\n\nolfactory lobes, paired cerebral hemispheres and\n\nunpaired diencephalon. The midbrain is\n\ncharacterised by a pair of optic lobes. Hind-brain\n\nconsists of cerebellum and medulla oblongata.\n\nThe medulla oblongata passes out through the\n\nforamen magnum and continues into spinal cord,\n\nwhich is enclosed in the vertebral column.\n\nFrog has different types of sense organs, namely\n\norgans of touch (sensory papillae), taste (taste\n\nbuds), smell (nasal epithelium), vision (eyes) and\n\nhearing (tympanum with internal ears). Out of\n\nthese, eyes and internal ears are well-organised\n\nstructures and the rest are cellular aggregations\n\naround nerve endings. Eyes in a frog are a pair of\n\nspherical structures situated in the orbit in skull.\n\nThese are simple eyes (possessing only one unit).\n\nExternal ear is absent in frogs and only tympanum\n\ncan be seen externally. The ear is an organ of\n\nhearing as well as balancing (equilibrium).\n\nFrogs have well organised male and female\n\nreproductive systems. Male reproductive organs\n\nconsist of a pair of yellowish ovoid testes (Figure\n\n7.21), which are found adhered to the upper part\n\nof kidneys by a double fold of peritoneum called\n\nmesorchium. Vasa efferentia are 10-12 in\n\nnumber that arise from testes. They enter the\n\nkidneys on their side and open into Bidder’s\n\ncanal. Finally it communicates with the\n\nurinogenital duct that comes out of the kidneys\n\nand opens into the cloaca. The cloaca is a small,\n\nmedian chamber that is used to pass faecal\n\nmatter, urine and sperms to the exterior.\n\nThe female reproductive organs include a pair\n\nof ovaries (Figure 7.22). The ovaries are situated\n\nnear kidneys and there is no functional\n\nconnection with kidneys.

A mature female can\n\nlay 2500 to 3000 ova at a time. Fertilisation is external and takes place in\n\nwater. Development involves a larval stage called tadpole. Tadpole\n\nundergoes metamorphosis to form the adult.\n\nFrogs are beneficial for mankind because they eat insects and protect\n\nthe crop. Frogs maintain ecological balance because these serve as an\n\nimportant link of food chain and food web in the ecosystem. In some\n\ncountries the muscular legs of frog are used as food by man.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nCells, tissues, organs and organ systems split up the work in a way that ensures\n\nthe survival of the body as a whole and exhibit division of labour. A tissue is\n\ndefined as group of cells along with intercellular substances performing one or\n\nmore functions in the body. Epithelia are sheet like tissues lining the body’s surface\n\nand its cavities, ducts and tubes. Epithelia have one free surface facing a body\n\nfluid or the outside environment. Their cells are structurally and functionally\n\nconnected at junctions.\n\nDiverse types of connective tissues bind together, support, strengthen, protect,\n\nand insulate other tissue in the body. Soft connective tissues consist of protein\n\nfibres as well as a variety of cells arranged in a ground substance. Cartilage, bone,\n\nblood, and adipose tissue are specialised connective tissues. Cartilage and bone\n\nare both structural materials. Blood is a fluid tissue with transport functions.\n\nAdipose tissue is a reservoir of stored energy. Muscle tissue, which can contract\n\n(shorten) in response to stimulation, helps in movement of the body and specific\n\nbody parts. Skeletal muscle is the muscle tissue attached to bones. Smooth muscle\n\nis a component of internal organs. Cardiac muscle makes up the contractile walls\n\nof the heart. Connective tissue covers all three types of tissues. Nervous tissue\n\nexerts greatest control over the response of body. Neurons are the basic units of\n\nnervous tissue.\n\nEarthworm, Cockroach and Frog show characteristic features in body\n\norganisation. In Pheretima posthuma (earthworm), the body is covered by cuticle.\n\nAll segments of its body are alike except the 14th, 15th and 16th segment, which are\n\nthick and dark and glandular, forming clitellum. A ring of S-shaped chitinous\n\nsetae is found in each segment. These setae help in locomotion. On the ventral\n\nside spermathecal openings are present in between the grooves of 5 and 6, 6 and\n\n7, 7 and 8 and 8 and 9 segments. Female genital pores are present on 14th segment\n\nand male genital pores on 18th segment. The alimentary canal is a narrow tube\n\nmade of mouth, buccal cavity, pharynx, gizzard, stomach, intestine and anus.\n\nThe blood vascular system is of closed type with heart and valves. Nervous system\n\nis represented by ventral nerve cord. Earthworm is hermaphorodite. Two pairs of\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSTRUCTURAL ORGANISATION IN ANIMALS 121\n\ntestes occur in the 10th and 11th segment, respectively. A pair of ovaries are present\n\non 12 and 13th intersegmental septum. It is a protandrous animal with cross-\n\nfertilisation. Fertilisation and development take place in cocoon secreted by the\n\nglands of clitellum.\n\nThe body of Cockroach (Periplaneta americana) is covered by chitinous\n\nexoskeleton. It is divided into head, thorax and abdomen. Segments bear jointed\n\nappendages. There are three segments of thorax, each bearing a pair of walking\n\nlegs. Two pairs of wings are present, one pair each on 2nd and 3rd segment. There\n\nare ten segments in abdomen. Alimentary canal is well developed with a mouth\n\nsurrounded by mouth parts, a pharynx, oesophagus, crop, gizzard, midgut,\n\nhindgut and anus. Hepatic caecae are present at the junction of foregut and\n\nmidgut. Malpighian tubules are present at the junction of midgut and hindgut\n\nand help in excretion. A pair of salivary gland is present near crop. The blood\n\nvascular system is of open type. Respiration takes place by network of tracheae.\n\nTrachea opens outside with spiracles. Nervous system is represented by\n\nsegmentally arranged ganglia and ventral nerve cord. A pair of testes is present in\n\n4th-6th segments and ovaries in 2nd-6th segments. Fertilisation is internal. Female\n\nproduces 9-10 ootheca bearing developing embryos. After rupturing of single\n\nootheca sixteen young ones, called nymphs come out.\n\nThe Indian bullfrog, Rana tigrina, is the common frog found in India. Body is\n\ncovered by skin. Mucous glands are present in the skin which is highly vascularised\n\nand helps in respiration in water and on land. Body is divisible into head and trunk.\n\nA muscular tongue is present, which is bilobed at the tip and is used in capturing\n\nthe prey. The alimentary canal consists of oesophagous, stomach, intestine and\n\nrectum, which open into the cloaca. The main digestive glands are liver and pancreas.\n\nIt can respire in water through skin and through lungs on land. Circulatory system\n\nis closed with single circulation. RBCs are nucleated. Nervous system is organised\n\ninto central, peripheral and autonomic. The organs of urinogenital system are kidneys\n\nand urinogenital ducts, which open into the cloaca. The male reproductive organ is\n\na pair of testes. The female reproductive organ is a pair of ovaries. A female lays\n\n2500-3000 ova at a time. The fertilisation and development are external. The eggs\n\nhatch into tadpoles, which metamorphose into frogs.\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1.
