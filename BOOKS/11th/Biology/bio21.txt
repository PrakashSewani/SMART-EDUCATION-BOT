Coordination is the\n\nprocess through which two or more organs interact and complement the\n\nfunctions of one another. For example, when we do physical exercises,\n\nthe energy demand is increased for maintaining an increased muscular\n\nactivity. The supply of oxygen is also increased. The increased supply of\n\noxygen necessitates an increase in the rate of respiration, heart beat and\n\nincreased blood flow via blood vessels. When physical exercise is stopped,\n\nthe activities of nerves, lungs, heart and kidney gradually return to their\n\nnormal conditions. Thus, the functions of muscles, lungs, heart, blood\n\nvessels, kidney and other organs are coordinated while performing physical\n\nexercises. In our body the neural system and the endocrine system jointly\n\ncoordinate and integrate all the activities of the organs so that they function\n\nin a synchronised fashion.\n\nThe neural system provides an organised network of point-to-point\n\nconnections for a quick coordination. The endocrine system provides\n\nchemical integration through hormones. In this chapter, you will learn\n\nabout the neural system of human, mechanisms of neural coordination\n\nlike transmission of nerve impulse, impulse conduction across a synapse\n\nand the physiology of reflex action.\n\nNEURAL CONTROL AND\nCOORDINATION\n\nCHAPTER  21\n\n21.1 Neural System\n\n21.2 Human Neural\n\nSystem\n\n21.3 Neuron as\n\nStructural and\n\nFunctional Unit\n\nof Neural\n\nSystem\n\n21.4  Central Neural\n\nSystem\n\n21.5 Reflex Action\n\nand Reflex Arc\n\n21.6 Sensory\n\nReception and\n\nProcessing\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n316 BIOLOGY\n\n21.1 NEURAL SYSTEM\n\nThe neural system of all animals is composed of highly specialised cells called\n\nneurons which can detect, receive and transmit different kinds of stimuli.\n\nThe neural organisation is very simple in lower invertebrates. For\n\nexample, in Hydra it is composed of a network of neurons. The neural\n\nsystem is better organised in insects, where a brain is present along with\n\na number of ganglia and neural tissues. The vertebrates have a more\n\ndeveloped neural system.\n\n21.2 HUMAN NEURAL SYSTEM\n\nThe human neural system is divided into two parts :\n\n(i) the central neural system (CNS)\n\n(ii) the peripheral neural system (PNS)\n\nThe CNS includes the brain and the spinal cord and is the site of\n\ninformation processing and control. The PNS comprises of all the nerves\n\nof the body associated with the CNS (brain and spinal cord). The nerve\n\nfibres of the PNS are of two types :\n\n(a) afferent fibres\n\n(b) efferent fibres\n\nThe afferent nerve fibres transmit impulses from tissues/organs to\n\nthe CNS and the efferent fibres transmit regulatory impulses from the\n\nCNS to the concerned peripheral tissues/organs.\n\nThe PNS is divided into two divisions called somatic neural system\n\nand autonomic neural system. The somatic neural system relays\n\nimpulses from the CNS to skeletal muscles while the autonomic neural\n\nsystem transmits impulses from the CNS to the involuntary organs and\n\nsmooth muscles of the body. The autonomic neural system is further\n\nclassified into sympathetic neural system and parasympathetic neural\n\nsystem.\n\n       Visceral nervous system is the part of the peripheral nervous system\n\nthat comprises the whole complex of nerves, fibres, ganglia, and plexuses\n\nby which impulses travel from the central nervous system to the viscera\n\nand from the viscera to the central nervous system.\n\n21.3 NEURON AS STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL UNIT OF\nNEURAL SYSTEM\n\nA neuron is a microscopic structure composed of three major parts, namely,\n\ncell body, dendrites and axon (Figure 21.1). The cell body contains cytoplasm\n\nwith typical cell organelles and certain granular bodies called Nissl’s granules.\n\nShort fibres which branch repeatedly and project out of the cell body also\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nNEURAL CONTROL AND COORDINATION 317\n\ncontain Nissl’s granules and are called dendrites. These\n\nfibres transmit impulses towards the cell body.   The\n\naxon is a long fibre, the distal end of which is branched.\n\nEach branch terminates as a bulb-like structure called\n\nsynaptic knob which possess synaptic vesicles\n\ncontaining chemicals called neurotransmitters. The\n\naxons transmit nerve impulses away from the cell body\n\nto a synapse or to a neuro-muscular junction. Based\n\non the number of axon and dendrites, the neurons are\n\ndivided into three types, i.e., multipolar (with one axon\n\nand two or more dendrites; found in the cerebral cortex),\n\nbipolar (with one axon and one dendrite, found in the\n\nretina of eye) and unipolar (cell body with one axon\n\nonly; found usually in the embryonic stage). There are\n\ntwo types of axons, namely, myelinated and non-\n\nmyelinated. The myelinated nerve fibres are enveloped\n\nwith Schwann cells, which form a myelin sheath\n\naround the axon. The gaps between two adjacent\n\nmyelin sheaths are called nodes of Ranvier.\n\nMyelinated nerve fibres are found in spinal and cranial\n\nnerves. Unmyelinated nerve fibre is enclosed by a\n\nSchwann cell that does not form a myelin sheath\n\naround the axon, and is commonly found in\n\nautonomous and the somatic neural systems.\n\n21.3.1 Generation and Conduction of\nNerve Impulse\n\nNeurons are excitable cells because their membranes are in a polarised\n\nstate. Do you know why the membrane of a neuron is polarised? Different\n\ntypes of ion channels are present on the neural membrane. These ion\n\nchannels are selectively permeable to different ions. When a neuron is not\n\nconducting any impulse, i.e., resting, the axonal membrane is\n\ncomparatively more permeable to potassium ions (K\n+\n) and nearly\n\nimpermeable to sodium ions (Na+). Similarly, the membrane is\n\nimpermeable to negatively charged proteins present in the axoplasm.\n\nConsequently, the axoplasm inside the axon contains high concentration\n\nof K+ and negatively charged proteins and low concentration of Na+. In\n\ncontrast, the fluid outside the axon contains a low concentration of K+, a\n\nhigh concentration of Na+ and thus form a concentration gradient. These\n\nionic gradients across the resting membrane are maintained by the active\n\ntransport of ions by the sodium-potassium pump which transports 3\n\nNa\n+\n outwards for 2 K\n\n+\n into the cell. As a result, the outer surface of the\n\naxonal membrane possesses a positive charge while its inner surface\n\nFigure 21.1 Structure of a neuron\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n318 BIOLOGY\n\nbecomes negatively charged and therefore is polarised. The electrical\n\npotential difference across the resting plasma membrane is called as the\n\nresting potential.\n\nYou might be curious to know about the mechanisms of generation\n\nof nerve impulse and its conduction along an axon. When a stimulus is\n\napplied at a site (Figure 21.2 e.g., point A) on the polarised membrane,\n\nthe membrane at the site A becomes freely permeable to Na+. This leads\n\nto a rapid influx of Na+ followed by the reversal of the polarity at that site,\n\ni.e., the outer surface of the membrane becomes negatively charged and\n\nthe inner side becomes positively charged. The polarity of the membrane\n\nat the site A is thus reversed and hence depolarised. The electrical potential\n\ndifference across the plasma membrane at the site A is called the\n\naction potential, which is in fact termed as a nerve impulse. At sites\n\nimmediately ahead, the axon (e.g., site B) membrane has a positive charge\n\non the outer surface and a negative charge on its inner surface. As a\n\nresult, a current flows on the inner surface from site A to site B. On the\n\nouter surface current flows from site B to site A (Figure 21.2) to complete\n\nthe circuit of current flow. Hence, the polarity at the site is reversed, and\n\nan action potential is generated at site B.  Thus, the impulse (action\n\npotential) generated at site A arrives at site B. The sequence is repeated\n\nalong the length of the axon and consequently the impulse is conducted.\n\nThe rise in the stimulus-induced permeability to Na+ is extremely short-\n\nlived. It is quickly followed by a rise in permeability to K+. Within a fraction\n\nof a second, K+ diffuses outside the membrane and restores the resting\n\npotential of the membrane at the site of excitation and the fibre becomes\n\nonce more responsive to further stimulation.\n\n- -\n\n-\n\n- - - - - - - -\n\n-\n-\n\n-\n--\n\n----\n\n+\n\n+ +\n\n++\n\n+ + + + + +\n\n+\n+ + + + + + + + +\n\n+++\n\n- -\n\n- -\n\n-\n\n- - - - - - - -\n\n-\n-\n\n-\n--\n\n----\n\n+\n\n+ +\n\n++\n\n+ + + + + +\n\n+\n+ + + + + + + + +\n\n+++\n\n- -\n\nA\n\nNa\n\nB\n\nNa\n\nFigure 21.2 Diagrammatic representation of impulse conduction through an axon\n(at points A and B)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nNEURAL CONTROL AND COORDINATION 319\n\n21.3.2 Transmission of Impulses\n\nA nerve impulse is transmitted from one neuron to another through\n\njunctions called synapses. A synapse is formed by the membranes of a\n\npre-synaptic neuron and a post-synaptic neuron, which may or may not\n\nbe separated by a gap called synaptic cleft. There are two types of\n\nsynapses, namely, electrical synapses and chemical synapses. At electrical\n\nsynapses, the membranes of pre- and post-synaptic neurons are in very\n\nclose proximity. Electrical current can flow directly from one neuron into\n\nthe other across these synapses. Transmission of an impulse across\n\nelectrical synapses is very similar to impulse conduction along a single\n\naxon. Impulse transmission across an electrical synapse is always faster\n\nthan that across a chemical synapse. Electrical synapses are rare in our\n\nsystem.\n\nAt a chemical synapse, the membranes of the pre- and post-synaptic\n\nneurons are separated by a fluid-filled space called synaptic cleft\n\n(Figure 21.3). Do you know how the pre-synaptic neuron transmits an\n\nimpulse (action potential) across the synaptic cleft to the post-synaptic\n\nneuron? Chemicals called neurotransmitters are involved in the\n\ntransmission of impulses at these synapses. The axon terminals contain\n\nvesicles filled with these neurotransmitters. When an impulse (action\n\npotential) arrives at the axon terminal, it stimulates the movement of the\n\nsynaptic vesicles towards the membrane where they fuse with the plasma\n\nFigure 21.3 Diagram showing axon terminal and synapse\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n320 BIOLOGY\n\nmembrane and release their neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft. The\n\nreleased neurotransmitters bind to their specific receptors, present on\n\nthe post-synaptic membrane. This binding opens ion channels allowing\n\nthe entry of ions which can generate a new potential in the post-synaptic\n\nneuron. The new potential developed may be either excitatory or\n\ninhibitory.\n\n21.4 CENTRAL NEURAL SYSTEM\n\nThe brain is the central information processing organ of our body, and\n\nacts as the ‘command and control system’. It controls the voluntary\n\nmovements, balance of the body, functioning of vital involuntary organs\n\n(e.g., lungs, heart, kidneys, etc.), thermoregulation, hunger and thirst,\n\ncircadian (24-hour) rhythms of our body, activities of several endocrine\n\nglands and human behaviour.  It is also the site for processing of vision,\n\nhearing, speech, memory, intelligence, emotions and thoughts.\n\nThe human brain is well protected by the skull. Inside the skull, the\n\nbrain is covered by cranial meninges consisting of an outer layer called\n\ndura mater, a very thin middle layer called arachnoid and an inner layer\n\n(which is in contact with the brain tissue) called pia mater. The brain can\n\nbe divided into three major parts: (i) forebrain, (ii) midbrain, and\n\n(iii) hindbrain (Figure 21.4).\n\nFigure 21.4 Diagram showing sagital section of the human brain\n\nF\no\nr\ne\nb\n\nr\na\nin\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nNEURAL CONTROL AND COORDINATION 321\n\n21.4.1 Forebrain\n\nThe forebrain consists of cerebrum, thalamus and hypothalamus\n\n(Figure 21.4). Cerebrum forms the major part of the human brain. A deep\n\ncleft divides the cerebrum longitudinally into two halves, which are termed\n\nas the left and right cerebral hemispheres. The hemispheres are\n\nconnected by a tract of nerve fibres called corpus callosum. The layer of\n\ncells which covers the cerebral hemisphere is called cerebral cortex and is\n\nthrown into prominent folds. The cerebral cortex is referred to as the grey\n\nmatter due to its greyish appearance. The neuron cell bodies are\n\nconcentrated here giving the colour. The cerebral cortex contains motor\n\nareas, sensory areas and large regions that are neither clearly sensory\n\nnor motor in function. These regions called as the association areas are\n\nresponsible for complex functions like intersensory associations, memory\n\nand communication. Fibres of the tracts are covered with the myelin sheath,\n\nwhich constitute the inner part of cerebral hemisphere. They give an\n\nopaque white appearance to the layer and, hence, is called the white matter.\n\nThe cerebrum wraps around a structure called thalamus, which is a major\n\ncoordinating centre for sensory and motor signaling. Another very\n\nimportant part of the brain called hypothalamus lies at the base of the\n\nthalamus. The hypothalamus contains a number of centres which control\n\nbody temperature, urge for eating and drinking. It also contains several\n\ngroups of neurosecretory cells, which secrete hormones called\n\nhypothalamic hormones. The inner parts of cerebral hemispheres and a\n\ngroup of associated deep structures like amygdala, hippocampus, etc.,\n\nform a complex structure called the limbic lobe or limbic system. Along\n\nwith the hypothalamus, it is involved in the regulation of sexual behaviour,\n\nexpression of emotional reactions (e.g., excitement, pleasure, rage and\n\nfear), and motivation.\n\n21.4.2 Midbrain\n\nThe midbrain is located between the thalamus/hypothalamus of the\n\nforebrain and pons of the hindbrain. A canal called the cerebral aqueduct\n\npassess through the midbrain. The dorsal portion of the midbrain consists\n\nmainly of four round swellings (lobes) called corpora quadrigemina.\n\n21.4.3 Hindbrain\n\nThe hindbrain comprises pons, cerebellum and medulla (also called\nthe medulla oblongata). Pons consists of fibre tracts that interconnect\n\ndifferent regions of the brain. Cerebellum has very convoluted surface in\norder to provide the additional space for many more neurons. The medulla\nof the brain is connected to the spinal cord. The medulla contains centres\n\nwhich control respiration, cardiovascular reflexes and gastric secretions.\nThree major regions make up the brain stem; mid brain, pons\n\nand medulla oblongata. Brain stem forms the connections between\n\nthe brain and spinal cord.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n322 BIOLOGY\n\n21.5 REFLEX ACTION AND REFLEX ARC\n\nYou must have experienced a sudden withdrawal of a body part which\n\ncomes in contact with objects that are extremely hot, cold  pointed or\n\nanimals that are scary or poisonous. The entire process of response to a\n\nperipheral nervous stimulation, that occurs involuntarily, i.e., without\n\nconscious effort or thought and requires the involvment of a part of the\n\ncentral nervous system is called a reflex action. The reflex pathway\n\ncomprises at least one afferent neuron (receptor) and one efferent (effector\n\nor excitor) neuron appropriately arranged in a series (Figure 21.5). The\n\nafferent neuron receives signal from a sensory organ and transmits the\n\nimpulse via a dorsal nerve root into the CNS (at the level of spinal cord).\n\nThe efferent nueuron then carries signals from CNS to the effector. The\n\nstimulus and response thus forms a reflex arc as shown below in the\n\nknee jerk reflex. You should carefully study Figure 21.5 to understand\n\nthe mechanism of a knee jerk reflex.\n\n21.6 SENSORY RECEPTION AND PROCESSING\n\nHave you ever thought how do you feel the climatic changes in the\n\nenvironment? How do you see an object and its colour? How do you\n\nhear a sound? The sensory organs detect all types of changes in the\n\nenvironment and send appropriate signals to the CNS, where all the inputs\n\nare processed and analysed. Signals are then sent to different parts/\n\ncentres of the brain. This is how you can sense changes in the environment.\n\nFigure 21.5 Diagrammatic presentation of reflex action (showing knee jerk reflex)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nNEURAL CONTROL AND COORDINATION 323\n\nSense Organs\n\nWe smell things by our nose, taste by tongue, hear by ear and see objects\n\nby eyes.\n\nThe nose contains mucus-coated receptors which are specialised for\n\nreceiving the sense of smell and called olfactory receptors. These are\n\nmade up of olfactory epithelium that consists of three kinds of cells. The\n\nneurons of the olfactory epithelium extend from the outside environment\n\ndirectly into a pair of broad bean-sized organs, called olfactory bulb,\n\nwhich are extensions of the brain’s limbic system.\n\n Both nose and tongue detect dissolved chemicals. The chemical senses\n\nof gustation (taste) and olfactory (smell) are functionally similar and\n\ninterrelated. The tongue detects tastes through taste buds, containing\n\ngustatory receptors. With each taste of food or sip of drink, the brain\n\nintegrates the differential input from the taste buds and a complex flavour\n\nis perceived.\n\nIn the following sections, you will be introduced to the structure and\n\nfunctioning of the eye (sensory organ for vision) and the ear (sensory organ\n\nfor hearing).\n\n21.6.1 Eye\n\nOur paired eyes are located in sockets of the skull called orbits. A brief\n\naccount of structure and functions of the human eye is given in the\n\nfollowing sections.\n\n21.6.1.1 Parts of an eye\n\nThe adult human eye ball is\n\nnearly a spherical structure. The\n\nwall of the eye ball is composed\n\nof three layers (Figure 21.6). The\n\nexternal layer is composed of a\n\ndense connective tissue and is\n\ncalled the sclera. The anterior\n\nportion of this layer is called the\n\ncornea. The middle layer,\n\nchoroid, contains many blood\n\nvessels and looks bluish in\n\ncolour. The choroid layer is thin\n\nover the posterior two-thirds of\n\nthe eye ball, but it becomes thick\n\nin the anterior part to form the\n\nciliary body. The ciliary body Figure 21.6  Diagram showing parts of an eye\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n324 BIOLOGY\n\nitself continues forward to form a pigmented and opaque structure called\n\nthe iris which is the visible coloured portion of the eye. The eye ball contains\n\na transparent crystalline lens which is held in place by ligaments attached\n\nto the ciliary body. In front of the lens, the aperture surrounded by the\n\niris is called the pupil. The diameter of the pupil is regulated by the muscle\n\nfibres of iris.\n\nThe inner layer is the retina and it contains three layers of neural cells –\n\nfrom inside to outside – ganglion cells, bipolar cells and photoreceptor cells.\n\nThere are two types of photoreceptor cells, namely, rods and cones. These\n\ncells contain the light-sensitive proteins called the photopigments. The\n\ndaylight (photopic) vision and colour vision are functions of cones and\n\nthe twilight (scotopic) vision is the function of the rods. The rods contain\n\na purplish-red protein called the rhodopsin or visual purple, which\n\ncontains a derivative of Vitamin A. In the human eye, there are three types\n\nof cones which possess their own characteristic photopigments that\n\nrespond to red, green and blue lights. The sensations of different colours\n\nare produced by various combinations of these cones and their\n\nphotopigments. When these cones are stimulated equally, a sensation of\n\nwhite light is produced.\n\nThe optic nerves leave the eye and the retinal blood vessels enter it at\n\na point medial to and slightly above the posterior pole of the eye ball.\n\nPhotoreceptor cells are not present in that region and hence it is called\n\nthe blind spot. At the posterior pole of the eye lateral to the blind spot,\n\nthere is a yellowish pigmented spot called macula lutea with a central pit\n\ncalled the fovea. The fovea is a thinned-out portion of the retina where\n\nonly the cones are densely packed. It is the point where the visual acuity\n\n(resolution) is the greatest.\n\nThe space between the cornea and the lens is called the aqueous\n\nchamber and contains a thin watery fluid called aqueous humor. The\n\nspace between the lens and the retina is called the vitreous chamber\n\nand is filled with a transparent gel called vitreous humor.\n\n21.6.1.2 Mechanism of Vision\n\nThe light rays in visible wavelength focussed on the retina through the\n\ncornea and lens generate potentials (impulses) in rods and cones. As\n\nmentioned earlier, the photosensitive compounds (photopigments) in the\n\nhuman eyes is composed of opsin (a protein) and retinal (an aldehyde of\n\nvitamin A). Light induces dissociation of the retinal from opsin resulting\n\nin changes in the structure of the opsin. This causes membrane\n\npermeability changes. As a result, potential differences are generated in\n\nthe photoreceptor cells. This produces a signal that generates action\n\npotentials in the ganglion cells through the bipolar cells. These action\n\npotentials (impulses) are transmitted by the optic nerves to the visual\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nNEURAL CONTROL AND COORDINATION 325\n\nFigure 21.7 Diagrammatic view of ear\n\ncortex area of the brain, where the neural impulses are analysed and the\n\nimage formed on the retina is recognised  based on earlier memory and\n\nexperience.\n\n21.6.2 The Ear\n\nThe ears perform two sensory functions, hearing and maintenance of body\n\nbalance. Anatomically, the ear can be divided into three major sections\n\ncalled the outer ear, the middle ear and the inner ear (Figure 21.7). The\n\nouter ear consists of the\n\npinna and external\n\nauditory meatus (canal).\n\nThe pinna collects the\n\nvibrations in the air which\n\nproduce sound.  The\n\nexternal auditory meatus\n\nleads inwards and extends\n\nup to the tympanic\n\nmembrane (the ear drum).\n\nThere are very fine hairs and\n\nwax-secreting glands in the\n\nskin of the pinna and the\n\nmeatus. The tympanic\n\nmembrane is composed of\n\nconnective tissues covered\n\nwith skin outside and with\n\nmucus membrane inside.\n\nThe middle ear contains three ossicles called malleus, incus and stapes\n\nwhich are attached to one another in a chain-like fashion. The malleus is\n\nattached to the tympanic membrane and the stapes is attached to the\n\noval window of the cochlea. The ear ossicles increase the efficiency of\n\ntransmission of sound waves to the inner ear. An Eustachian tube\n\nconnects the middle ear cavity with the pharynx. The Eustachian tube\n\nhelps in equalising the pressures on either sides of the ear drum.\n\nThe fluid-filled inner ear called labyrinth consists of two parts, the\n\nbony and the membranous labyrinths. The bony labyrinth is a series of\n\nchannels. Inside these channels lies the membranous labyrinth, which is\n\nsurrounded by a fluid called perilymph. The membranous labyrinth is\n\nfilled with a fluid called endolymph. The coiled portion of the labyrinth is\n\ncalled cochlea. The membranes constituting cochlea, the reissner’s and\n\nbasilar, divide the surounding perilymph filled bony labyrinth into an\n\nupper scala vestibuli and a lower scala tympani (Figure 21.8). The space\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n326 BIOLOGY\n\nThe organ of corti is a structure located on the basilar membrane\n\nwhich contains hair cells that act as auditory receptors. The hair cells\n\nare present in rows on the internal side of the organ of corti. The basal\n\nend of the hair cell is in close contact with the afferent nerve fibres. A large\n\nnumber of processes called stereo cilia are projected from the apical part\n\nof each hair cell. Above the rows of the hair cells is a thin elastic membrane\n\ncalled tectorial membrane.\n\nThe inner ear also contains a complex system called vestibular\n\napparatus, located above the cochlea. The vestibular apparatus is\n\ncomposed of three semi-circular canals and the otolith (macula is the\n\nsensory part of saccule and utricle). Each semi-circular canal lies in a\n\ndifferent plane at right angles to each other. The membranous canals are\n\nsuspended in the perilymph of the bony canals. The base of canals is\n\nFigure 21.8  Diagrammatic representation of the sectional view of cochlea\n\nwithin cochlea called scala media is filled with endolymph. At the base of\n\nthe cochlea, the scala vestibuli ends at the oval window, while the scala\n\ntympani terminates at the round window which opens to the middle ear.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nNEURAL CONTROL AND COORDINATION 327\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe neural system coordinates and integrates functions as well as metabolic\n\nand homeostatic activities of all the organs. Neurons, the functional units of\n\nneural system are excitable cells due to a differential concentration gradient of\n\nions across the membrane. The electrical potential difference across the resting\n\nneural membrane is called the ‘resting potential’. The nerve impulse is conducted\n\nalong the axon membrane in the form of a wave of depolarisation and\n\nrepolarisation. A synapse is formed by the membranes of a pre-synaptic neuron\n\nand a post-synaptic neuron which may or may not be separated by a gap called\n\nsynaptic cleft. Chemicals involved in the transmission of impulses at chemical\n\nsynapses are called neurotransmitters.\n\nHuman neural system consists of two parts : (i) central neural system (CNS)\n\nand (ii) the peripheral neural system. The CNS consists of the brain and spiral\n\ncord. The brain can be divided into three major parts : (i) forebrain, (ii) midbrain\n\nand (iii) hindbrain. The forebrain consists of cerebrum, thalamus and\n\nhypothalamus. The cerebrum is longitudinally divided into two halves that are\n\nconnected by the corpus callosum. A very important part of the forebrain called\n\nhypothalamus controls the body temperature, eating and drinking. Inner parts\n\nswollen and is called ampulla, which contains a projecting ridge called\n\ncrista ampullaris which has hair cells. The saccule and utricle contain a\n\nprojecting ridge called macula. The crista and macula are the specific\n\nreceptors of the vestibular apparatus responsible for maintenance of\n\nbalance of the body and posture.\n\n20.6.2.1 Mechanism of Hearing\n\nHow does ear convert sound waves into neural impulses, which are\n\nsensed and processed by the brain enabling us to recognise a sound ?\n\nThe external ear receives sound waves and directs them to the ear drum.\n\nThe ear drum vibrates in response to the sound waves and these vibrations\n\nare transmitted through the ear ossicles (malleus, incus and stapes) to\n\nthe oval window. The vibrations are passed through the oval window on\n\nto the fluid of the cochlea, where they generate waves in the lymphs. The\n\nwaves in the lymphs induce a ripple in the basilar membrane. These\n\nmovements of the basilar membrane bend the hair cells, pressing them\n\nagainst the tectorial membrane. As a result, nerve impulses are generated\n\nin the associated afferent neurons. These impulses are transmitted by\n\nthe afferent fibres via auditory nerves to the auditory cortex of the brain,\n\nwhere the impulses are analysed and the sound is recognised.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n328 BIOLOGY\n\nof cerebral hemispheres and a group of associated deep structures form a\n\ncomplex structure called limbic system which is concerned with olfaction,\n\nautonomic responses, regulation of sexual behaviour, expression of emotional\n\nreactions, and motivation. The midbrain receives and integrates visual, tactile\n\nand auditory inputs. The hindbrain comprises pons, cerebellum and medulla.\n\nThe cerebellum integrates information received from the semicircular canals of\n\nthe ear and the auditory system. The medulla contains centres, which control\n\nrespiration, cardiovascular reflexes, and gastric secretions. Pons consist of fibre\n\ntracts that interconnect different regions of the brain. The entire process of\n\ninvoluntary response to a peripheral nervous stimulation is called reflex action.\n\nInformation regarding changes in the environment is received by the CNS\n\nthrough the sensory organs which are processed and analysed. Signals are then\n\nsent for necessary adjustments. The wall of the human eye ball is composed of\n\nthree layers. The external layer is composed of cornea and sclera. Inside sclera is\n\nthe middle layer, which is called the choroid. Retina, the innermost layer, contains\n\ntwo types of photoreceptor cells, namely rods and cones. The daylight (photopic)\n\nvision and colour vision are functions of cones and twilight (scotopic) vision is the\n\nfunction of the rods. The light enters through cornea, the lens and the images of\n\nobjects are formed on the retina.\n\nThe ear can be divided into the outer ear, the middle ear and the inner ear. The\n\nmiddle ear contains three ossicles called malleus, incus and stapes. The fluid\n\nfilled inner ear is called the labyrinth, and the coiled portion of the labyrinth is\n\ncalled cochlea. The organ of corti is a structure which contains hair cells that act\n\nas auditory receptors and is located on the basilar membrane. The vibrations\n\nproduced in the ear drum are transmitted through the ear ossicles and oval window\n\nto the fluid-filled inner ear. Nerve impulses are generated and transmitted by the\n\nafferent fibres to the auditory cortex of the brain. The inner ear also contains a\n\ncomplex system located above the cochlea called vestibular apparatus. It is\n\ninfluenced by gravity and movements, and helps us in maintaining balance of the\n\nbody and posture.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nNEURAL CONTROL AND COORDINATION 329\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1.
