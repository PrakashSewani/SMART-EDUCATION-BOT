This description is mainly of gross structural features,\nboth external and internal. In addition, observable and perceivable\nliving phenomena were also recorded as part of this description. Before\nexperimental biology or more specifically, physiology, was established\nas a part of biology, naturalists described only biology. Hence, biology\nremained as a natural history for a long time. The description, by itself,\nwas amazing in terms of detail. While the initial reaction of a student\ncould be boredom, one should keep in mind  that the detailed description,\nwas utilised in the later day reductionist biology where living processes\ndrew more attention from scientists than the description of life forms\nand their structure. Hence, this description became meaningful and\nhelpful in framing research questions in physiology or evolutionary\nbiology. In the following chapters of this unit, the structural organisation\nof plants and animals, including the structural basis of physiologial or\nbehavioural phenomena, is described. For convenience, this description\nof morphological and anatomical features is presented separately for\nplants and animals.\n\nSTRUCTURAL ORGANISATION\n\nIN PLANTS AND ANIMALS\n\nChapter 5\nMorphology of\nFlowering Plants\n\nChapter 6\nAnatomy of Flowering\nPlants\n\nChapter 7\nStructural Organisation in\nAnimals\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nKATHERINE ESAU was born in Ukraine in 1898. She  studied\nagriculture in Russia and Germany and received her doctorate\nin 1931 in United States. She reported in her early publications\nthat the curly top virus spreads through a plant via the food-\nconducting or phloem tissue. Dr Esau’s Plant Anatomy published\nin 1954 took a dynamic, developmental approach designed to\nenhance one’s understanding of plant structure and an\nenormous impact worldwide, literally bringing about a revival\nof the discipline. The Anatomy of Seed Plants by Katherine Esau\nwas published in 1960. It was referred to as Webster’s of plant\nbiology – it is encyclopediac. In 1957 she was elected to the\nNational Academy of Sciences, becoming the sixth woman to\nreceive that honour. In addition to this prestigious award, she\nreceived the National Medal of Science from President George\nBush in 1989.\n\nWhen Katherine Esau died in the year 1997, Peter Raven,\ndirector of Anatomy and Morphology, Missouri Botanical\nGarden, remembered that she  ‘absolutely dominated’ the field\nof plant biology even at the age of 99.\n\nKatherine Esau\n(1898 – 1997)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nThe wide range in the structure of higher plants will never fail to fascinate\n\nus. Even though the angiosperms show such a large diversity in external\n\nstructure or morphology, they are all characterised by presence of roots,\n\nstems, leaves, flowers and fruits.\n\nIn chapters 2 and 3, we talked about classification of plants based\n\non morphological and other characteristics. For any successful attempt\n\nat classification and at understanding any higher plant (or for that\n\nmatter any living organism) we need to know standard technical terms\n\nand  standard definitions. We also need to know about the possible\n\nvariations in different parts, found as adaptations of the plants to their\n\nenvironment, e.g., adaptions to various habitats, for protection,\n\nclimbing, storage, etc.\n\nIf you pull out any weed you will see that all of them have roots, stems\n\nand leaves. They may be bearing flowers and fruits. The underground\n\npart of the flowering plant is the root system while the portion above the\n\nground  forms the shoot system (Figure 5.1).\n\n5.1 THE ROOT\n\nIn majority of the dicotyledonous plants, the direct elongation of the radicle\n\nleads to the formation of primary root which grows inside the soil.\n\nIt bears lateral roots of several orders that are referred to as secondary,\n\ntertiary, etc. roots. The primary roots and its branches constitute the\n\nMORPHOLOGY OF FLOWERING PLANTS\n\nCHAPTER  5\n\n5.1 The Root\n\n5.2  The Stem\n\n5.3 The Leaf\n\n5.4 The Inflorescence\n\n5.5 The Flower\n\n5.6 The Fruit\n\n5.7 The Seed\n\n5.8 Semi-technical\n\nDescription of a\n\nTypical\n\nFlowering Plant\n\n5.9 Description of\n\nSome Important\n\nFamilies\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n66 BIOLOGY\n\nFlower\n\nShoot\nsystem\n\nRoot\nsystem\n\nFruit\n\nBud\n\nStem\n\nLeaf\n\nNode\n\nInternode\n\nPrimary\nroot\n\nSecondary\nroot\n\n{\n\nFigure 5.2 Different types of roots : (a) Tap  (b) Fibrous  (c) Adventitious\n\n(c)(b)\n\nFigure 5.1  Parts of a flowering plant\n\nFibrous roots Adventitious roots\n\nLaterals\n\n(a)\n\nMain root\n\ntap root system, as seen in the mustard\n\nplant (Figure 5.2a). In monocotyledonous\n\nplants, the primary root is short lived and\n\nis replaced by a large number of roots.\n\nThese roots originate from the base of the\n\nstem and constitute the fibrous root\n\nsystem, as seen in the wheat plant (Figure\n\n5.2b). In some plants, like grass,\n\nMonstera and the banyan tree, roots arise\n\nfrom parts of the plant other than the\n\nradicle and are called adventitious roots\n\n(Figure 5.2c). The main functions of the\n\nroot system are absorption of water and\n\nminerals from the soil, providing a proper\n\nanchorage to the plant parts, storing\n\nreserve food material and synthesis of\n\nplant growth regulators.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMORPHOLOGY OF FLOWERING PLANTS 67\n\n5.1.1 Regions of the Root\n\nThe root is covered at the apex by a thimble-like\n\nstructure called the root cap (Figure 5.3). It\n\nprotects the tender apex of the root as it makes\n\nits way through the soil. A few millimetres above\n\nthe root cap is the region of meristematic\n\nactivity.  The cells of this region are very small,\n\nthin-walled and with dense protoplasm. They\n\ndivide repeatedly. The cells proximal to this\n\nregion undergo rapid elongation and\n\nenlargement and are responsible for the growth\n\nof the root in length. This region is called the\n\nregion of elongation. The cells of the elongation\n\nzone gradually differentiate and mature. Hence,\n\nthis zone, proximal to region of elongation, is\n\ncalled the region of maturation.  From this\n\nregion some of the epidermal cells form very fine\n\nand delicate, thread-like structures called root\n\nhairs. These root hairs absorb water and\n\nminerals from the soil.\n\n5.1.2 Modifications of Root\n\nRoots in some plants change their shape and\n\nstructure and become modified to perform\n\nfunctions other than absorption and\n\nconduction of water and minerals. They are\n\nmodified for support, storage of food and\n\nrespiration (Figure 5.4 and 5.5). Tap roots of\n\ncarrot, turnip and adventitious roots of sweet\n\npotato, get swollen and store food. Can you give\n\nsome more such examples? Have you ever\n\nwondered what those hanging structures that\n\nsupport a banyan tree are? These are called\n\nprop roots. Similarly, the stems of maize and\n\nsugarcane have supporting roots coming out\n\nof the lower nodes of the stem. These are called\n\nstilt roots. In some plants such as Rhizophora\n\ngrowing in swampy areas, many roots come out\n\nof the ground and grow vertically upwards.\n\nSuch roots, called pneumatophores, help to\n\nget oxygen for respiration (Figure 5.5b).\n\nFigure 5.3  The regions of the root-tip\n\nFigure 5.4 Modification of root for support:\nBanyan tree\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n68 BIOLOGY\n\n5.2 THE STEM\n\nWhat are the features that distinguish a stem from a root? The stem is the\n\nascending part of the axis bearing branches, leaves, flowers and fruits. It\n\ndevelops from the plumule of the embryo of a germinating seed. The stem\n\nbears nodes and internodes. The region of the stem where leaves are\n\nborn are called nodes while internodes are the portions between two nodes.\n\nThe stem bears buds, which may be terminal or axillary. Stem is generally\n\ngreen when young and later often become woody and dark brown.\n\nThe main function of the stem is spreading out branches bearing\n\nleaves, flowers and fruits. It conducts water, minerals and photosynthates.\n\nSome stems perform the function of storage of food, support, protection\n\nand of vegetative propagation.\n\n5.2.1 Modifications of Stem\n\nThe stem may not always be typically like what they are expected to be.\n\nThey are modified to perform different functions (Figure 5.6). Underground\n\nstems of potato, ginger, turmeric, zaminkand, Colocasia are modified to\n\nstore food in them. They also act as organs of perennation to tide over\n\nconditions unfavourable for growth. Stem tendrils which develop from\n\naxillary buds, are slender and spirally coiled and help plants to climb\n\nsuch as in gourds (cucumber, pumpkins, watermelon) and grapevines.\n\nAxillary buds of stems may also get modified into woody, straight and\n\npointed thorns. Thorns are found in many  plants such as Citrus,\n\nBougainvillea. They protect plants from browsing animals. Some plants\n\nof arid regions modify their stems into flattened (Opuntia), or fleshy\n\ncylindrical (Euphorbia) structures. They contain chlorophyll and carry\n\nFigure 5.5 Modification of root for : (a) storage (b) respiration: pneumatophore in\nRhizophora\n\n(b)( a )\n\nCarrotTurnip Sweet\npotato\n\nAsparagus\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMORPHOLOGY OF FLOWERING PLANTS 69\n\nFigure 5.6 Modifications of stem for :  (a) storage  (b) support  (c) protection\n(d) spread and vegetative propagation\n\nout photosynthesis. Underground stems of some plants such as grass\n\nand strawberry, etc., spread to new niches and when older parts die new\n\nplants are formed. In plants like mint and jasmine a slender lateral branch\n\narises from the base of the main axis and after growing aerially for some\n\ntime arch downwards to touch the ground. A lateral branch with short\n\ninternodes and  each node bearing a rosette of leaves and a tuft of roots is\n\nfound in aquatic plants like Pistia and Eichhornia.  In banana, pineapple\n\nand Chrysanthemum, the lateral branches originate from the basal and\n\nunderground portion of the main stem, grow horizontally beneath the\n\nsoil and then come out obliquely upward giving rise to leafy shoots.\n\n5.3 THE LEAF\n\nThe leaf is a lateral, generally flattened structure borne on the stem. It\n\ndevelops at the node and bears a bud in its axil. The axillary bud later\n\ndevelops into a branch. Leaves originate from shoot apical meristems and\n\nare arranged in an acropetal order. They are the most important vegetative\n\norgans for photosynthesis.\n\nA typical leaf consists of three main parts:  leaf base, petiole and lamina\n\n(Figure 5.7 a). The leaf is attached to the stem by the leaf base and may\n\n(a)\n(b)\n\n(c) (d)\n\nAxillary bud\nmodified\ninto tendril\n\nRoots arising\nfrom nodes\n\nStem modified\ninto spine\n\nGinger\n\nZaminkand\nPotato\n\nBougainvillea sp.\nOxalis sp.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n70 BIOLOGY\n\nbear two lateral small leaf like structures called\n\nstipules. In monocotyledons, the leaf base expands\n\ninto a sheath covering the stem partially or wholly.\n\nIn some leguminous plants the leafbase may\n\nbecome swollen, which is called the pulvinus. The\n\npetiole help hold the blade to light. Long thin flexible\n\npetioles allow leaf blades to flutter in wind, thereby\n\ncooling the leaf and bringing fresh air to leaf surface.\n\nThe lamina or the leaf blade is the green expanded\n\npart of the leaf with veins and veinlets. There is,\n\nusually, a middle prominent vein, which is known\n\nas the midrib. Veins provide rigidity to the leaf blade\n\nand act as channels of transport for water, minerals\n\nand food materials. The shape, margin, apex, surface\n\nand extent of incision of lamina varies in different\n\nleaves.\n\n5.3.1 Venation\n\nThe arrangement of veins and the veinlets in the\n\nlamina of leaf is termed as venation. When the\n\nveinlets form a network, the venation is termed as\n\nreticulate (Figure 5.7 b). When the veins run\n\nparallel to each other within a lamina, the venation\n\nis termed as parallel (Figure 5.7 c). Leaves of\n\ndicotyledonous plants generally possess reticulate\n\nvenation, while parallel venation is the characteristic\n\nof most monocotyledons.\n\n5.3.2 Types of Leaves\n\nA leaf is said to be simple, when its lamina is entire\n\nor when incised, the incisions do not touch the\n\nmidrib. When the incisions of the lamina reach up\n\nto the midrib breaking it into a number of leaflets,\n\nthe leaf is called compound. A bud is present\n\nin the axil of petiole in both simple and compound\n\nleaves, but not in the axil of leaflets of the compound\n\nleaf.\n\nThe compound leaves may be of two types\n\n(Figure 5.8). In a pinnately compound leaf a\n\nnumber of leaflets are present on a common axis,\n\nthe rachis, which represents the midrib of the leaf\n\nas in neem.\n\nFigure 5.7 Structure of a leaf :\n(a) Parts of a leaf\n(b) Reticulate venation\n(c) Parallel venation\n\n(b) (c)\n\n(b) Silk Cotton\n\n(a)\n\nLamina\n\nPetiole\n\nStipule\n\nLeaf\nbase\n\nAxillary\nbud\n\n(a) Neem\n\nFigure 5.8 Compound leaves :\n(a) pinnately compound leaf\n(b) palmately compound leaf\n\nRachis\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMORPHOLOGY OF FLOWERING PLANTS 71\n\nIn palmately compound leaves, the\n\nleaflets are attached at a common point, i.e.,\n\nat the tip of petiole, as in silk cotton.\n\n5.3.3 Phyllotaxy\n\nPhyllotaxy is the pattern of arrangement of\n\nleaves on the stem or branch. This is usually\n\nof three types – alternate, opposite and\n\nwhorled (Figure 5.9). In alternate type of\n\nphyllotaxy,  a single leaf arises at each node\n\nin alternate manner, as in china rose,\n\nmustard and sun flower plants. In opposite\n\ntype, a pair of leaves arise at each node and\n\nlie opposite to each other as in Calotropis\n\nand guava plants. If more than two leaves\n\narise at a node and form a whorl, it is called\n\nwhorled, as in Alstonia.\n\n5.3.4 Modifications of Leaves\n\nLeaves are often modified to perform\n\nfunctions other than photosynthesis. They\n\nare converted into tendrils for climbing as\n\nin peas or into spines for defence as in cacti\n\n(Figure 5.10 a, b). The fleshy leaves of onion\n\nand garlic store food (Figure 5.10c). In some\n\nplants such as Australian acacia, the leaves\n\nare small and short-lived. The petioles in\n\nthese plants expand, become green and\n\nsynthesise food. Leaves of certain\n\ninsectivorous plants such as pitcher plant,\n\nvenus-fly trap are also modified leaves.\n\n5.4 THE INFLORESCENCE\n\nA flower is a modified shoot wherein the shoot\n\napical meristem changes to floral meristem.\n\nInternodes do not elongate and the axis gets\n\ncondensed. The apex produces different\n\nkinds of floral appendages laterally at\n\nsuccessive nodes instead of leaves.  When a\n\nshoot tip transforms into a flower, it is always\n\nsolitary. The arrangement of flowers on the\n\nFigure 5.10 Modifications of leaf for :\n(a) support: tendril  (b) protection:\nspines  (c) storage: fleshy leaves\n\n(c) Onion\n\nFleshy\nleaves\n\nLeaf\ntendril\n\n(a) Pea\n(b) Cactus\n\nLeaves\nmodified\ninto spines\n\nFigure 5.9 Different types of phyllotaxy :\n(a) Alternate (b) Opposite\n(c) Whorled\n\n(c) Alstonia\n\n(a) China rose\n(b) Guava\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n72 BIOLOGY\n\nfloral axis is termed as inflorescence. Depending\n\non whether the apex gets developed into a flower or\n\ncontinues to grow, two major types of inflorescences\n\nare defined – racemose and cymose. In racemose\n\ntype of inflorescences the main axis continues to\n\ngrow, the flowers are borne laterally in an acropetal\n\nsuccession (Figure 5.11).\n\nIn cymose type of  inflorescence the main axis\n\nterminates in a flower, hence is limited in growth.The\n\nflowers are borne in a basipetal order (Figure 5.12).\n\n5.5 THE FLOWER\n\nThe flower is the reproductive unit in the\n\nangiosperms. It is meant for sexual reproduction.\n\nA typical flower has four different kinds of whorls\n\narranged successively on the swollen end of the\n\nstalk or pedicel, called thalamus or receptacle.\n\nThese are calyx, corolla, androecium and\n\ngynoecium. Calyx and corolla are accessory organs,\n\nwhile androecium and gynoecium are reproductive\n\norgans. In some flowers like lily, the calyx and\n\ncorolla are not distinct and are termed as perianth.\n\nWhen a flower has both androecium and\n\ngynoecium, it is bisexual. A flower having either\n\nonly stamens or only carpels is unisexual.\n\nIn symmetry, the flower may be\n\nactinomorphic (radial symmetry) or\n\nzygomorphic (bilateral symmetry). When a flower\n\ncan be divided into two equal radial halves in any\n\nradial plane passing through the centre, it is said\n\nto be actinomorphic, e.g., mustard, datura, chilli.\n\nWhen it can be divided into two similar halves only\n\nin one particular vertical plane, it is zygomorphic,\n\ne.g., pea, gulmohur, bean, Cassia. A flower is\n\nasymmetric (irregular) if it cannot be divided into\n\ntwo similar halves by any vertical plane passing\n\nthrough the centre, as in canna.\n\nA flower may be trimerous, tetramerous or\n\npentamerous when the floral appendages are in\n\nmultiple of 3, 4 or 5, respectively. Flowers\n\nwith bracts-reduced leaf found at the base of the\n\npedicel- are called bracteate and those without\n\nbracts, ebracteate.\n\nFigure 5.12  Cymose inflorescence\n\nFigure 5.11  Racemose inflorescence\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMORPHOLOGY OF FLOWERING PLANTS 73\n\nBased on the position of calyx, corolla and androecium in respect of\n\nthe ovary on thalamus, the flowers are described as hypogynous,\n\nperigynous and epigynous (Figure 5.13). In the hypogynous flower the\n\ngynoecium occupies the highest position while the other parts are situated\n\nbelow it. The ovary in such flowers is said to be superior, e.g., mustard,\n\nchina rose and brinjal. If gynoecium is situated in the centre and other\n\nparts of the flower are located on the rim of the thalamus almost at the\n\nsame level, it is called perigynous. The ovary here is said to be half\n\ninferior, e.g., plum, rose, peach. In epigynous flowers, the margin of\n\nthalamus grows upward enclosing the ovary completely and getting fused\n\nwith it, the other parts of flower arise above the ovary. Hence, the ovary is\n\nsaid to be inferior as in flowers of guava and cucumber, and the ray\n\nflorets of sunflower.\n\n5.5.1 Parts of a Flower\n\nEach flower normally has four floral whorls, viz., calyx, corolla,\n\nandroecium and gynoecium (Figure 5.14).\n\n5.5.1.1 Calyx\n\nThe calyx is the outermost whorl of the flower and the members are called\n\nsepals. Generally, sepals are green, leaf like and protect the flower in the\n\nbud stage. The calyx may be gamosepalous (sepals united) or\n\npolysepalous (sepals free).\n\n5.5.1.2 Corolla\n\nCorolla is composed of petals. Petals are usually brightly coloured to\n\nattract insects for pollination. Like calyx, corolla may also be\n\nFigure 5.13 Position of floral parts on thalamus : (a) Hypogynous (b)  and (c)\nPerigynous  (d) Epigynous\n\n(a) (b) (c) (d)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n74 BIOLOGY\n\ngamopetalous (petals united) or polypetalous (petals free). The shape\n\nand colour of corolla vary greatly in plants. Corolla may be tubular, bell-\n\nshaped, funnel-shaped or wheel-shaped.\n\nAestivation: The mode of arrangement of sepals or petals in floral bud\n\nwith respect to the other members of the same whorl is known as\n\naestivation. The main types of aestivation are valvate, twisted, imbricate\n\nand vexillary (Figure 5.15). When sepals or petals in a whorl just touch\n\none another at the margin, without overlapping, as in Calotropis, it is\n\nsaid to be valvate. If one margin of  the appendage overlaps that of the\n\nnext one and so on as in china rose, lady’s finger and cotton, it is called\n\ntwisted.  If the margins of sepals or petals overlap one another but not in\n\nany particular direction as in Cassia and gulmohur, the aestivation is\n\ncalled imbricate. In pea and bean flowers, there are five petals, the largest\n\n(standard) overlaps the two lateral petals (wings) which in turn overlap\n\nthe two smallest anterior petals (keel);  this type of aestivation is known\n\nas vexillary or papilionaceous.\n\nPedicel\n\nCalyx\n\nCorolla\n\nAndroecium\n\nGynoecium\n\nFigure 5.14  Parts of a flower\n\nFigure 5.15 Types of aestivation in corolla : (a) Valvate (b) Twisted (c) Imbricate (d) Vexillary\n\n(a) (b) (c) (d)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMORPHOLOGY OF FLOWERING PLANTS 75\n\n5.5.1.3 Androecium\n\nAndroecium is composed of stamens. Each stamen which\n\nrepresents the male reproductive organ consists of a stalk or a\n\nfilament and an anther. Each anther is usually bilobed and each\n\nlobe has two chambers, the pollen-sacs. The pollen grains are\n\nproduced in pollen-sacs. A sterile stamen is called staminode.\n\nStamens of flower may be united with other members such as\n\npetals or among themselves. When stamens are attached to the\n\npetals, they are epipetalous as in brinjal, or epiphyllous when\n\nattached to the perianth as in the flowers of lily. The stamens in a\n\nflower may either remain free (polyandrous) or may be united in\n\nvarying degrees. The stamens may be united into one bunch or\n\none bundle (monoadelphous) as in china rose, or two bundles\n\n(diadelphous) as in pea, or into more than two  bundles\n\n(polyadelphous) as in citrus. There may be a variation in the length\n\nof filaments within a flower, as in Salvia and mustard.\n\n5.5.1.4 Gynoecium\n\nGynoecium is the female reproductive part of the flower and is made\n\nup of one or more carpels. A carpel consists of three parts namely\n\nstigma, style and ovary. Ovary is the enlarged basal part, on which\n\nlies the elongated tube, the style. The style connects the ovary to the\n\nstigma. The stigma is usually at the tip of the style and is the\n\nreceptive surface for pollen grains. Each ovary bears one or more\n\novules attached to a flattened, cushion-like placenta. When more\n\nthan one carpel is present, they may be free (as in lotus and rose)\n\nand are called apocarpous. They are termed syncarpous when\n\ncarpels are fused, as in mustard and tomato. After fertilisation, the\n\novules develop into seeds and the ovary matures into a fruit.\n\nPlacentation: The arrangement of ovules within the ovary is known\n\nas placentation. The placentation are of different types namely,\n\nmarginal, axile, parietal, basal, central and free central (Figure 5.16).\n\nIn marginal  placentation the placenta forms a ridge along the\n\nventral suture of the ovary and the ovules are borne on this ridge\n\nforming two rows, as in pea. When the  placenta is axial and the\n\novules are attached to it in a multilocular ovary, the placentaion is\n\nsaid to be axile, as in china rose, tomato and lemon. In parietal\n\nplacentation, the ovules develop on the inner wall of the ovary or\n\non peripheral part. Ovary is one-chambered but it becomes two-\n\nchambered due to the formation of the false septum, e.g., mustard\n\nand Argemone. When the ovules are borne on central axis and\n\nsepta are absent, as in Dianthus and Primrose the placentation is\n\nFigure 5.16 Types of\nplacentation :\n(a) Marginal\n(b) Axile\n(c) Parietal\n(d) Free central\n(e) Basal\n\n(a)\n\n(e)\n\n(b)\n\n(d)\n\n(c)\n\n(a)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n76 BIOLOGY\n\ncalled free central. In basal placentation, the placenta develops at the\n\nbase of ovary and a single ovule is attached to it, as in sunflower, marigold.\n\n5.6 THE FRUIT\n\nThe fruit is a characteristic feature of the flowering plants. It is a mature\n\nor ripened ovary, developed after fertilisation. If a fruit is formed without\n\nfertilisation of the ovary, it is called a parthenocarpic fruit.\n\nGenerally, the fruit consists of a wall or pericarp and seeds. The\n\npericarp may be dry or fleshy. When pericarp is thick and fleshy, it is\n\ndifferentiated into the outer epicarp, the middle mesocarp and the inner\n\nendocarp.\n\nIn mango and coconut, the fruit is known as a drupe (Figure 5.17).\n\nThey develop from monocarpellary superior ovaries and are one seeded.\n\nIn mango the pericarp is well differentiated into an outer thin epicarp, a\n\nmiddle fleshy edible mesocarp and an inner stony hard endocarp. In\n\ncoconut which is also a drupe, the mesocarp is fibrous.\n\n5.7 THE SEED\n\nThe ovules after fertilisation, develop into seeds. A seed is made up of a\n\nseed coat and an embryo. The embryo is made up of a radicle, an embryonal\n\naxis and one (as in wheat, maize) or two cotyledons (as in gram and pea).\n\n5.7.1 Structure of a Dicotyledonous Seed\n\nThe outermost covering of a seed is the seed coat. The seed coat has two\n\nlayers, the outer testa and the inner tegmen. The hilum is a scar on the\n\nseed coat through which the developing seeds were attached to the fruit.\n\nAbove the hilum is a small pore called the micropyle. Within the seed\n\nFigure 5.17  Parts of a fruit : (a) Mango  (b) Coconut\n\n(a) (b)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMORPHOLOGY OF FLOWERING PLANTS 77\n\ncoat is the embryo, consisting of an\n\nembryonal axis and two cotyledons. The\n\ncotyledons are often fleshy and full of reserve\n\nfood materials. At the two ends of the\n\nembryonal axis are present the radicle and\n\nthe plumule (Figure 5.18). In some seeds\n\nsuch as castor the endosperm formed as a\n\nresult of double fertilisation, is a food storing\n\ntissue and called endospermic seeds. In\n\nplants such as bean, gram and pea, the\n\nendosperm is not present in mature seeds\n\nand such seeds are called non-\n\nendospermous.\n\nSeed coat\n\nHilum\n\nMicropyle\n\nCotyledon\nPlumule\n\nRadicle\n\nFigure 5.18 Structure of dicotyledonous seed\n\nFigure 5.19 Structure of a monocotyledonous seed\n\nSeed coat & fruit-wall\n\nAleurone layer\n\nEndosperm\n\nScutellum\n\nColeoptile\n\nPlumule\n\nRadicle\n\nColeorhiza\n\nEndosperm\n\nEmbryo\n\n5.7.2 Structure of Monocotyledonous Seed\n\nGenerally, monocotyledonous seeds are endospermic but some as in\n\norchids are non-endospermic. In the seeds of cereals such as maize the\n\nseed coat is membranous and generally fused with the fruit wall. The\n\nendosperm is bulky and stores food. The outer covering of endosperm\n\nseparates the embryo by a proteinous layer called aleurone layer. The\n\nembryo is   small and situated in a groove at one end of the endosperm. It\n\nconsists of one large and shield shaped cotyledon known as scutellum\n\nand a short axis with a plumule and a radicle. The plumule and radicle\n\nare enclosed in sheaths which are called coleoptile and coleorhiza\n\nrespectively (Figure 5.19).\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n78 BIOLOGY\n\n5.8 SEMI-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION OF A TYPICAL\nFLOWERING PLANT\n\nVarious morphological features are used to describe a\n\nflowering plant. The description has to be brief, in a simple\n\nand scientific language and presented in a proper\n\nsequence. The plant is described beginning with its habit,\n\nvegetative characters – roots, stem and leaves and then\n\nfloral characters inflorescence and flower parts. After\n\ndescribing various parts of plant, a floral diagram and a\n\nfloral formula are presented. The floral formula is\n\nrepresented by some symbols. In the floral formula, Br\n\nstands for bracteate K stands for calyx , C for corolla, P for\n\nperianth, A for androecium and G for Gynoecium, G for\n\nsuperior ovary and G  for inferior ovary,  for male,  for\n\nfemale,  for bisexual plants, ⊕  for actinomorphic and \n\nfor zygomorphic nature of flower. Fusion is indicated by\n\nenclosing the figure within bracket and adhesion by a line\n\ndrawn above the symbols of the floral parts. A floral\n\ndiagram provides information about the number of parts\n\nof a flower, their arrangement and the relation they have\n\nwith one another (Figure 5.20). The position of the mother\n\naxis with respect to the flower is represented by a dot on\n\nthe top of the floral diagram. Calyx, corolla, androecium\n\nand gynoecium are drawn in successive whorls, calyx being\n\nthe outermost and the gynoecium being in the centre.\n\nFloral formula also shows cohesion and adhesion within\n\nparts of whorls and between whorls. The floral diagram\n\nand floral formula in Figure 5.20 represents the mustard\n\nplant (Family: Brassicaceae).\n\n5.9 DESCRIPTION OF SOME IMPORTANT FAMILIES\n\n5.9.1 Fabaceae\n\nThis family was earlier called Papilionoideae, a subfamily\n\nof family Leguminosae.

They have well developed root and shoot\n\nsystems. Root system is either tap root or fibrous. Generally, dicotyledonous plants\n\nhave tap roots while monocotyledonous plants have fibrous roots. The roots in\n\nsome plants get modified for storage of food, mechanical support and respiration.\n\nThe shoot system is differentiated into stem, leaves, flowers and fruits. The\n\nmorphological features of stems like the presence of nodes and internodes,\n\nmulticellular hair and positively phototropic nature help to differentiate the stems\n\nfrom roots. Stems also get modified to perform diverse functions such as storage\n\nof food, vegetative propagation and protection under different conditions. Leaf is a\n\nlateral outgrowth of stem developed exogeneously at the node. These are green in\n\ncolour to perform the function of photosynthesis. Leaves exhibit marked variations\n\nin their shape, size, margin, apex and extent of incisions of leaf blade (lamina).\n\nLike other parts of plants, the leaves also get modified into other structures such\n\nas tendrils, spines for climbing and protection respectively.\n\nThe flower is a modified shoot, meant for sexual reproduction. The flowers are\n\narranged in different types of inflorescences. They exhibit enormous variation in\n\nstructure, symmetry, position of ovary in relation to other parts, arrangement of\n\npetals, sepals, ovules etc. After fertilisation, the ovary is modified into fruits and\n\novules into seeds. Seeds either may be monocotyledonous or dicotyledonous. They\n\nvary in shape, size and period of viability. The floral characteristics form the basis\n\nof classification and identification of flowering plants. This can be illustrated\n\nthrough semi-technical descriptions of families. Hence, a flowering plant is\n\ndescribed in a definite sequence by using scientific terms. The floral features are\n\nrepresented in the summarised form as floral diagrams and floral formula.\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1. What is meant by modification of root?
