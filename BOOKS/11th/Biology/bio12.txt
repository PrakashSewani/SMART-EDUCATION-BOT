They\n\nrequire macromolecules, such as carbohydrates, proteins and fats, and\n\nwater and minerals for their growth and development.\n\nThis chapter focusses mainly on inorganic plant nutrition, wherein\n\nyou will study the methods to identify elements essential to growth and\n\ndevelopment of plants and the criteria for establishing the essentiality.\n\nYou will also study the role of the essential elements, their major deficiency\n\nsymptoms and the mechanism of absorption of these essential elements.\n\nThe chapter also introduces you briefly to the significance and the\n\nmechanism of biological nitrogen fixation.\n\n12.1 METHODS TO STUDY THE MINERAL REQUIREMENTS OF PLANTS\n\nIn 1860, Julius von Sachs, a prominent German botanist, demonstrated,\n\nfor the first time, that plants could be grown to maturity in a defined\n\nnutrient solution in complete absence of soil. This technique of growing\n\nplants in a nutrient solution is known as hydroponics. Since then, a\n\nnumber of improvised methods have been employed to try and determine\n\nthe mineral nutrients essential for plants. The essence of all these methods\n\ninvolves the culture of plants in a soil-free, defined mineral solution. These\n\nmethods require purified water and mineral nutrient salts. Can you\n\nexplain why is this so essential?\n\nAfter a series of experiments in which the roots of the plants were\n\nimmersed in nutrient solutions and wherein an element was added /\n\nsubstituted / removed or given in varied concentration, a mineral solution\n\nMINERAL NUTRITION\n\nCHAPTER  12\n\n12.1 Methods to\n\nStudy the\n\nMineral\n\nRequirements of\n\nPlants\n\n12.2 Essential\n\nMineral\n\nElements\n\n12.3 Mechanism of\n\nAbsorption of\n\nElements\n\n12.4 Translocation of\n\nSolutes\n\n12.5 Soil as Reservoir\n\nof Essential\n\nElements\n\n12.6 Metabolism of\n\nNitrogen\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMINERAL NUTRITION 195\n\nsuitable for the plant growth was obtained. By this\n\nmethod, essential elements were identified and\n\ntheir deficiency symptoms discovered. Hydroponics\n\nhas been successfully employed as a technique for\n\nthe commercial production of vegetables such as\n\ntomato, seedless cucumber and lettuce. It must be\n\nemphasised that the nutrient solutions must be\n\nadequately aerated to obtain the optimum growth.\n\nWhat would happen if solutions were poorly\n\naerated? Diagrammatic views of the hydroponic\n\ntechnique is given in Figures 12.1 and 12.2.\n\n12.2 ESSENTIAL MINERAL ELEMENTS\n\nMost of the minerals present in soil can enter plants\n\nthrough roots. In fact, more than sixty elements of\n\nthe 105 discovered so far are found in different\n\nplants. Some plant species accumulate selenium,\n\nsome others gold, while some plants growing near\n\nnuclear test sites take up radioactive strontium.\n\nThere are techniques that are able to detect the\n\nminerals even at a very low concentration (10-8 g/\n\nmL). The question is, whether all the diverse mineral\n\nelements present in a plant, for example, gold and\n\nselenium as mentioned above, are really necessary\n\nfor plants? How do we decide what is essential for\n\nplants and what is not?\n\n12.2.1 Criteria for Essentiality\n\nThe criteria for essentiality of an element are given\n\nbelow:\n\n(a) The element must be absolutely necessary for\n\nsupporting normal growth and reproduction.\n\nIn the absence of the element the plants do not\n\ncomplete their life cycle or set the seeds.\n\n(b) The requirement of the element must be specific\n\nand not replaceable by another element. In\n\nother words, deficiency of any one element\n\ncannot be met by supplying some other\n\nelement.\n\n(c) The element must be directly involved in the\n\nmetabolism of the plant.\n\nFigure 12.1  Diagram of a typical set-up for\nnutrient solution culture\n\nFigure 12.2 Hydroponic plant production.\nPlants are grown in a tube or\ntrough placed on a slight\nincline. A pump circulates a\nnutrient solution from a\nreservoir to the elevated end of\nthe tube. The solution flows\ndown the tube and returns to\nthe reservoir due to gravity.\nInset shows a plant whose\nroots are continuously bathed\nin aerated nutrient solution.\nThe arrows indicates the\ndirection of the flow.\n\nNutrient\nsolution Pump\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n196 BIOLOGY\n\nBased upon the above criteria only a few elements have been found to\n\nbe absolutely essential for plant growth and metabolism. These elements\n\nare further divided into two broad categories based on their quantitative\n\nrequirements.\n\n(i) Macronutrients, and\n\n(ii) Micronutrients\n\nMacronutrients are generally present in plant tissues in large amounts\n\n(in excess of 10 mmole Kg –1 of dry matter). The macronutrients include\n\ncarbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorous, sulphur, potassium,\n\ncalcium and magnesium. Of these, carbon, hydrogen and oxygen are\n\nmainly obtained from CO\n2\n and H\n\n2\nO, while the others are absorbed from\n\nthe soil as mineral nutrition.\n\nMicronutrients or trace elements, are needed in very small amounts\n\n(less than 10 mmole Kg –1 of dry matter). These include iron, manganese,\n\ncopper, molybdenum, zinc, boron, chlorine and nickel.\n\nIn addition to the 17 essential elements named above, there are some\n\nbeneficial elements such as sodium, silicon, cobalt and selenium. They\n\nare required by higher plants.\n\nEssential elements can also be grouped into four broad categories on\n\nthe basis of their diverse functions. These categories are:\n\n(i) Essential elements as components of biomolecules and hence\n\nstructural elements of cells (e.g., carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and\n\nnitrogen).\n\n(ii) Essential elements that are components of energy-related chemical\n\ncompounds in plants (e.g., magnesium in chlorophyll and\n\nphosphorous in ATP).\n\n(iii) Essential elements that activate or inhibit enzymes, for example\n\nMg2+ is an activator for both ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-\n\noxygenase and phosphoenol pyruvate carboxylase, both of which\n\nare critical enzymes in photosynthetic carbon fixation; Zn2+ is an\n\nactivator of alcohol dehydrogenase and Mo of nitrogenase during\n\nnitrogen metabolism. Can you name a few more elements that\n\nfall in this category? For this, you will need to recollect some of\n\nthe biochemical pathways you have studied earlier.\n\n(iv) Some essential elements can alter the osmotic potential of a cell.\n\nPotassium plays an important role in the opening and closing of\n\nstomata. You may recall the role of minerals as solutes in\n\ndetermining the water potential of a cell.\n\n12.2.2 Role of Macro- and Micro-nutrients\n\nEssential elements perform several functions. They participate in various\n\nmetabolic processes in the plant cells such as permeability of cell\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMINERAL NUTRITION 197\n\nmembrane, maintenance of osmotic concentration of cell sap, electron-\n\ntransport systems, buffering action, enzymatic activity and act as major\n\nconstituents of macromolecules and co-enzymes.\n\nVarious forms and functions of essential nutrient elements are given\n\nbelow.\n\nNitrogen: This is the essential nutrient element required by plants in the\n\ngreatest amount. It is absorbed mainly as NO\n3\n–  though some are also taken\n\nup as NO\n2\n–  or NH\n\n4\n+. Nitrogen is required by all parts of a plant, particularly\n\nthe meristematic tissues and the metabolically active cells. Nitrogen is one of\n\nthe major constituents of proteins, nucleic acids, vitamins and hormones.\n\nPhosphorus: Phosphorus is absorbed by the plants from soil in the form\n\nof phosphate ions (either as H PO2 4\n−  or HPO4\n\n2− ). Phosphorus is a\n\nconstituent of cell membranes, certain proteins, all nucleic acids and\n\nnucleotides, and is required for all phosphorylation reactions.\n\nPotassium: It is absorbed as potassium ion (K+). In plants, this is required\n\nin more abundant quantities in the meristematic tissues, buds, leaves\n\nand root tips. Potassium helps to maintain an anion-cation balance in\n\ncells and is involved in protein synthesis, opening and closing of stomata,\n\nactivation of enzymes and in the maintenance of the turgidity of cells.\n\nCalcium: Plant absorbs calcium from the soil in the form of calcium ions\n\n(Ca2+). Calcium is required by meristematic and differentiating tissues.\n\nDuring cell division it is used in the synthesis of cell wall, particularly as\n\ncalcium pectate in the middle lamella. It is also needed during the\n\nformation of mitotic spindle. It accumulates in older leaves. It is involved\n\nin the normal functioning of the cell membranes. It activates certain\n\nenzymes and plays an important role in regulating metabolic activities.\n\nMagnesium: It is absorbed by plants in the form of divalent Mg2+. It\n\nactivates the enzymes of respiration, photosynthesis and are involved in\n\nthe synthesis of DNA and RNA. Magnesium is a constituent of the ring\n\nstructure of chlorophyll and helps to maintain the ribosome structure.\n\nSulphur: Plants obtain sulphur in the form of sulphate ( )SO4\n2− . Sulphur is\n\npresent in two amino acids – cysteine and methionine and is the main\n\nconstituent of several coenzymes, vitamins (thiamine, biotin, Coenzyme A)\n\nand ferredoxin.\n\nIron: Plants obtain iron in the form of ferric ions (Fe3+). It is required in\n\nlarger amounts in comparison to other micronutrients. It is an important\n\nconstituent of proteins involved in the transfer of electrons like ferredoxin\n\nand cytochromes. It is reversibly oxidised from Fe2+ to Fe3+ during electron\n\ntransfer. It activates catalase enzyme, and is essential for the formation of\n\nchlorophyll.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n198 BIOLOGY\n\nManganese: It is absorbed in the form of manganous ions (Mn2+). It\n\nactivates many enzymes involved in photosynthesis, respiration and\n\nnitrogen metabolism. The best defined function of manganese is in the\n\nsplitting of water to liberate oxygen during photosynthesis.\n\nZinc: Plants obtain zinc as Zn2+ ions. It activates various enzymes,\n\nespecially carboxylases. It is also needed in the synthesis of auxin.\n\nCopper: It is absorbed as cupric ions (Cu2+). It is essential for the overall\n\nmetabolism in plants. Like iron, it is associated with certain enzymes\n\ninvolved in redox reactions and is reversibly oxidised from Cu+ to Cu2+.\n\nBoron : It is absorbed as BO3\n3−  or B O4 7\n\n2− . Boron is required for uptake\n\nand utilisation of Ca2+, membrane functioning, pollen germination, cell\n\nelongation, cell differentiation and carbohydrate translocation.\n\nMolybdenum: Plants obtain it in the form of molybdate ions ( )MoO\n2\n2+ . It\n\nis a component of several enzymes, including nitrogenase and nitrate\n\nreductase both of which participate in nitrogen metabolism.\n\nChlorine: It is absorbed in the form of chloride anion (Cl–). Along with\n\nNa+ and K+, it helps in determining the solute concentration and the anion-\n\ncation balance in cells. It is essential for the water-splitting reaction in\n\nphotosynthesis, a reaction that leads to oxygen evolution.\n\n12.2.3 Deficiency Symptoms of Essential Elements\n\nWhenever the supply of an essential element becomes limited, plant growth\n\nis retarded. The concentration of the essential element below which plant\n\ngrowth is retarded is termed as critical concentration. The element is\n\nsaid to be deficient when present below the critical concentration.\n\nSince each element has one or more specific structural or functional\n\nrole in plants, in the absence of any particular element, plants show certain\n\nmorphological changes. These morphological changes are indicative of\n\ncertain element deficiencies and are called deficiency symptoms. The\n\ndeficiency symptoms vary from element to element and they disappear\n\nwhen the deficient mineral nutrient is provided to the plant. However, if\n\ndeprivation continues, it may eventually lead to the death of the plant. The\n\nparts of the plants that show the deficiency symptoms also depend on the\n\nmobility of the element in the plant. For elements that are actively mobilised\n\nwithin the plants and exported to young developing tissues, the deficiency\n\nsymptoms tend to appear first in the older tissues. For example, the\n\ndeficiency symptoms of nitrogen, potassium and magnesium are visible\n\nfirst in the senescent leaves. In the older leaves, biomolecules containing\n\nthese elements are broken down, making these elements available for\n\nmobilising to younger leaves.\n\nThe deficiency symptoms tend to appear first in the young tissues\n\nwhenever the elements are relatively immobile and are not transported\n\nout of the mature organs, for example, element like sulphur and\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMINERAL NUTRITION 199\n\ncalcium are a part of the structural component of the cell and hence are\n\nnot easily released. This aspect of mineral nutrition of plants is of a great\n\nsignificance and importance to agriculture and horticulture.\n\nThe kind of deficiency symptoms shown in plants include chlorosis,\n\nnecrosis, stunted plant growth, premature fall of leaves and buds, and\n\ninhibition of cell division. Chlorosis is the loss of chlorophyll leading to\n\nyellowing in leaves. This symptom is caused by the deficiency of elements\n\nN, K, Mg, S, Fe, Mn, Zn and Mo. Likewise, necrosis, or death of tissue,\n\nparticularly leaf tissue, is due to the deficiency of Ca, Mg, Cu, K. Lack or\n\nlow level of N, K, S, Mo causes an inhibition of cell division. Some elements\n\nlike N, S, Mo delay flowering if their concentration in plants is low.\n\nYou can see from the above that the deficiency of any element can\n\ncause multiple symptoms and that the same symptoms may be caused\n\nby the deficiency of one of several different elements. Hence, to identify\n\nthe deficient element, one has to study all the symptoms developed in all\n\nthe various parts of the plant and compare them with the available\n\nstandard tables. We must also be aware that different plants also respond\n\ndifferently to the deficiency of the same element.\n\n12.2.4 Toxicity of Micronutrients\n\nThe requirement of micronutrients is always in low amounts while their\n\nmoderate decrease causes the deficiency symptoms and a moderate increase\n\ncauses toxicity. In other words, there is a narrow range of concentration at\n\nwhich the elements are optimum. Any mineral ion concentration in tissues\n\nthat reduces the dry weight of tissues by about 10 per cent is considered\n\ntoxic. Such critical concentrations vary widely among different\n\nmicronutrients. The toxicity symptoms are difficult to identify. Toxicity levels\n\nfor any element also vary for different plants. Many a times, excess of an\n\nelement may inhibit the uptake of another element. For example, the\n\nprominent symptom of manganese toxicity is the appearance of brown\n\nspots surrounded by chlorotic veins. It is important to know that\n\nmanganese competes with iron and magnesium for uptake and with\n\nmagnesium for binding with enzymes. Manganese also inhibit calcium\n\ntranslocation in shoot apex. Therefore, excess of manganese may, in fact,\n\ninduce deficiencies of iron, magnesium and calcium. Thus, what appears\n\nas symptoms of manganese toxicity may actually be the deficiency\n\nsymptoms of iron, magnesium and calcium. Can this knowledge be of some\n\nimportance to a farmer? a gardener? or even for you in your kitchen-garden?\n\n12.3 MECHANISM OF ABSORPTION OF ELEMENTS\n\nMuch of the studies on mechanism of absorption of elements by plants\n\nhas been carried out in isolated cells, tissues or organs. These studies\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n200 BIOLOGY\n\nrevealed that the process of absorption can be demarcated into two main\n\nphases. In the first phase, an initial rapid uptake of ions into the ‘free\n\nspace’ or ‘outer space’ of cells – the apoplast, is passive. In the second\n\nphase of uptake, the ions are taken in slowly into the ‘inner space’ –  the\n\nsymplast of the cells. The passive movement of ions into the apoplast\n\nusually occurs through ion-channels, the trans-membrane proteins that\n\nfunction as selective pores. On the other hand, the entry or exit of ions to\n\nand from the symplast requires the expenditure of metabolic energy, which\n\nis an active process. The movement of ions is usually called flux; the\n\ninward movement into the cells is influx and the outward movement, efflux.\n\nYou have read the aspects of mineral nutrient uptake and translocation\n\nin plants in Chapter 11.\n\n12.4 TRANSLOCATION OF SOLUTES\n\nMineral salts are translocated through xylem along with the ascending\n\nstream of water, which is pulled up through the plant by transpirational\n\npull. Analysis of xylem sap shows the presence of mineral salts in it. Use\n\nof radioisotopes of mineral elements also substantiate the view that they\n\nare transported through the xylem. You have already discussed the\n\nmovement of water in xylem in Chapter 11.\n\n12.5 SOIL AS RESERVOIR OF ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS\n\nMajority of the nutrients that are essential for the growth and\n\ndevelopment of plants become available to the roots due to weathering\n\nand breakdown of rocks. These processes enrich the soil with dissolved\n\nions and inorganic salts. Since they are derived from the rock minerals,\n\ntheir role in plant nutrition is referred to as mineral nutrition. Soil\n\nconsists of a wide variety of substances. Soil not only supplies minerals\n\nbut also harbours nitrogen-fixing bacteria, other microbes, holds water,\n\nsupplies air to the roots and acts as a matrix that stabilises the plant.\n\nSince deficiency of essential minerals affect the crop-yield, there is often\n\na need for supplying them through fertilisers. Both macro-nutrients\n\n(N, P, K, S, etc.) and micro-nutrients (Cu, Zn, Fe, Mn, etc.) form\n\ncomponents of fertilisers and are applied as per need.\n\n12.6 METABOLISM OF NITROGEN\n\n12.6.1 Nitrogen Cycle\n\nApart from carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, nitrogen is the most\n\nprevalent element in living organisms. Nitrogen is a constituent of\n\namino acids, proteins, hormones, chlorophylls and many of the\n\nvitamins. Plants compete with microbes for the limited nitrogen that\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMINERAL NUTRITION 201\n\nis available in soil. Thus, nitrogen is\n\na limiting nutrient for both natural\n\nand agricultural eco-systems.\n\nNitrogen exists as two nitrogen atoms\n\njoined by a very strong triple covalent\n\nbond (N ≡ N).  The process of\n\nconversion of  nitrogen (N\n2\n)  to\n\nammonia is termed as nitrogen-\n\nfixation. In nature, lightning and\n\nultraviolet radiation provide enough\n\nenergy to convert nitrogen to nitrogen\n\noxides (NO, NO\n2\n, N\n\n2\nO). Industrial\n\ncombustions, forest fires, automobile\n\nexhausts and power -generating\n\nstations are also sources of\n\natmospheric nitrogen oxides.\n\nDecomposition of organic nitrogen of\n\ndead plants and animals into\n\nammonia is called ammonification.\n\nSome of this ammonia volatilises and\n\nre-enters the atmosphere but most of\n\nit is converted into nitrate by soil\n\nbacteria in the following steps:\n\nFigure 12.3 The nitrogen cycle showing\nrelationship between the three\nmain nitrogen pools – atmospheric\nsoil, and biomass\n\n2 3 2 2 23 2 2 2NH O NO H H O+ \uf8e7 →\uf8e7 + +\n− + .... (i)\n\n2 22 2 3NO O NO\n− −\n\n+ \uf8e7 →\uf8e7 ...... (ii)\n\nAmmonia is first oxidised to nitrite by the bacteria Nitrosomonas and/or\n\nNitrococcus. The nitrite is further oxidised to nitrate with the help of the\n\nbacterium Nitrobacter. These steps are called nitrification (Figure 12.3).\n\nThese nitrifying bacteria are chemoautotrophs.\n\nThe nitrate thus formed is absorbed by plants and is transported to\n\nthe leaves. In leaves, it is reduced to form ammonia that finally forms the\n\namine group of amino acids. Nitrate present in the soil is also reduced to\n\nnitrogen by the process of denitrification. Denitrification is carried by\n\nbacteria Pseudomonas and Thiobacillus.\n\n12.6.2 Biological Nitrogen Fixation\n\nVery few living organisms can utilise the nitrogen in the form N\n2\n,\n \navailable\n\nabundantly in the air. Only certain prokaryotic species are capable of\n\nfixing nitrogen. Reduction of nitrogen to ammonia by living organisms is\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n202 BIOLOGY\n\ncalled biological nitrogen fixation. The enzyme, nitrogenase which is\n\ncapable of nitrogen reduction is present exclusively in prokaryotes. Such\n\nmicrobes are called N\n2\n- fixers.\n\nN N NH\nNitrogenase\n\n≡ \uf8e7 →\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7 3\n\nThe nitrogen-fixing microbes could be free-living or symbiotic. Examples\n\nof free-living nitrogen-fixing aerobic microbes are Azotobacter and\n\nBeijerinckia while Rhodospirillum is anaerobic and free-living. In addition,\n\na number of cyanobacteria such as Anabaena and Nostoc are also free-\n\nliving nitrogen-fixers.\n\nSymbiotic biological nitrogen fixation\n\nSeveral types of symbiotic biological nitrogen fixing associations are known.\n\nThe most prominent among them is the legume-bacteria relationship.\n\nSpecies of rod-shaped Rhizobium has such relationship with the roots of\n\nseveral legumes such as alfalfa, sweet clover, sweet pea, lentils, garden pea,\n\nbroad bean, clover beans, etc.  The most common association on roots is\n\nas nodules. These nodules are small outgrowths on the roots. The microbe,\n\nFrankia, also produces nitrogen-fixing nodules on the roots of non-\n\nleguminous plants (e.g., Alnus). Both Rhizobium and Frankia are free-\n\nliving in soil, but as symbionts, can fix atmospheric nitrogen.\n\nUproot any one plant of a common pulse, just before flowering. You\n\nwill see near-spherical outgrowths on the roots. These are nodules. If\n\nyou cut through them you will notice that the central portion is red or\n\npink. What makes the nodules pink? This is due to the presence of\n\nleguminous haemoglobin or leg-haemoglobin.\n\nNodule Formation\n\nNodule formation involves a sequence of multiple interactions between\n\nRhizobium and roots of the host plant. Principal stages in the nodule\n\nformation are summarised as follows:\n\nRhizobia multiply and colonise the surroundings of roots and get attached\n\nto epidermal and root hair cells. The root-hairs curl and the bacteria invade\n\nthe root-hair. An infection thread is produced carrying the bacteria into\n\nthe cortex of the root, where they initiate the nodule formation in the cortex\n\nof the root. Then the bacteria are released from the thread into the cells\n\nwhich leads to the differentiation of specialised nitrogen fixing cells. The\n\nnodule thus formed, establishes a direct vascular connection with the host\n\nfor exchange of nutrients. These events are depicted in Figure 12.4.\n\nThe nodule contains all the necessary biochemical components, such\n\nas the enzyme nitrogenase and leghaemoglobin. The enzyme nitrogenase\n\nis a Mo-Fe protein and catalyses the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen\n\nto ammonia, (Figure 12.5) the first stable product of nitrogen fixation.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMINERAL NUTRITION 203\n\nThe reaction is as follows:\n\n–\n2 3 2 iN 8e 8H 16ATP 2NH H 16ADP 16P\n\n+\n\n+ + + \uf8e7\uf8e7→ + + +\n\nThe enzyme nitrogenase is highly sensitive to the molecular oxygen; it\n\nrequires anaerobic conditions. The nodules have adaptations that ensure\n\nthat the enzyme is protected from oxygen. To protect these enzymes, the\n\nnodule contains an oxygen scavenger called leg-haemoglobin. It is interesting\n\nto note that these microbes live as aerobes under free-living conditions (where\n\nnitrogenase is not operational), but during nitrogen-fixing events, they become\n\nanaerobic (thus protecting the nitrogenase enzyme). You must have noticed\n\nin the above reaction that the ammonia synthesis by nitrogenease requires a\n\nSoil\nparticles\n\nRoot hair\n\nBacteria\n\nInner cortex and\npericycle cells\nunder division\n\nInfection\nthread\n\ncontaining\nbacteria\n\nMature nodule\n\nHook\n\nBacteria\n\nFigure 12.4 Development of root nodules in soyabean : (a) Rhizobium bacteria\ncontact a susceptible root hair, divide near it, (b) Successful infection\nof the root hair causes it to curl, (c) Infected thread carries the bacteria\nto the inner cortex.

While most of the plants can assimilate nitrate as well\n\nas ammonium ions, the latter is quite toxic to plants and hence cannot\n\naccumulate in them. Let us now see how the NH4\n+  is used to synthesise\n\namino acids in plants. There are two main ways in which this can take place:\n\n(i) Reductive amination : In these processes, ammonia reacts with\n\nα-ketoglutaric acid and forms glutamic acid as indicated in the\n\nequation given below :\n\n(ii) Transamination : It involves the transfer of amino group from one\n\namino acid to the keto group of a keto acid. Glutamic acid is the main\n\namino acid from which the transfer of NH\n2\n, the amino group takes\n\nplace and other amino acids are formed through transamination. The\n\nenzyme transaminase catalyses all such reactions. For example,\n\nα − + + \uf8e7 →\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\n+\n\nketoglutaric acid NH NADPH\nGlutamate\n\nDehydrogenase4\n\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7 + +glutamate H O NADP2\n\nThe two most important amides – asparagine and glutamine – found in\n\nplants are a structural part of proteins. They are formed from two amino\n\nacids, namely aspartic acid and glutamic acid, respectively, by addition\n\nof another amino group to each. The hydroxyl part of the acid is replaced\n\nby another NH\n2\n– radicle. Since amides contain more nitrogen than the\n\namino acids, they are transported to other parts of the plant via xylem\n\nvessels. In addition, along  with the transpiration stream the nodules of\n\nsome plants (e.g., soyabean) export the fixed nitrogen as ureides. These\n\ncompounds also have a particularly high nitrogen to carbon ratio.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nPlants obtain their inorganic nutrients from air, water and soil. Plants absorb a\n\nwide variety of mineral elements. Not all the mineral elements that they absorb are\n\nrequired by plants. Out of the more than 105 elements discovered so far, less than\n\n21 are essential and beneficial for normal plant growth and development. The\n\nelements required in large quantities are called macronutrients while those required\n\nin less quantities or in trace are termed as micronutrients. These elements are\n\neither essential constituents of proteins, carbohydrates, fats, nucleic acid etc.,\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMINERAL NUTRITION 205\n\nand/or take part in various metabolic processes. Deficiency of each of these\n\nessential elements may lead to symptoms called deficiency symptoms. Chlorosis,\n\nnecrosis, stunted growth, impaired cell division, etc., are some prominent deficiency\n\nsymptoms. Plants absorb minerals through roots by either passive or active\n\nprocesses. They are carried to all parts of the organism through xylem along with\n\nwater transport.\n\nNitrogen is very essential for the sustenance of life. Plants cannot use\n\natmospheric nitrogen directly. But some of the plants in association with N\n2\n-fixing\n\nbacteria, especially roots of legumes, can fix this atmospheric nitrogen into\n\nbiologically usable forms. Nitrogen fixation requires a strong reducing agent and\n\nenergy in the form of ATP. N\n2\n -fixation is accomplished with the help of nitrogen-\n\nfixing microbes, mainly Rhizobium. The enzyme nitrogenase which plays an\n\nimportant role in biological N\n2\n  fixation is very sensitive to oxygen. Most of the\n\nprocesses take place in anaerobic environment. The energy, ATP, required is\n\nprovided by the respiration of the host cells. Ammonia produced following N\n2\n  fixation\n\nis incorporated into amino acids as the amino group.\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1. ‘All elements that are present in a plant need not be essential to its survival’.\n\nComment.\n\n2. Why is purification of water and nutrient salts so important in studies involving\n\nmineral nutrition using hydroponics?\n\n3. Explain with examples: macronutrients, micronutrients, beneficial nutrients,\n\ntoxic elements and essential elements.\n\n4. Name at least five different deficiency symptoms in plants. Describe them and\n\ncorrelate them with the concerned mineral deficiency.\n\n5. If a plant shows a symptom which could develop due to deficiency of more than\n\none nutrient, how would you find out experimentally, the real deficient mineral\n\nelement?\n\n6. Why is that in certain plants deficiency symptoms appear first in younger parts\n\nof the plant while in others they do so in mature organs?\n\n7. How are the minerals absorbed by the plants?\n\n8. What are the conditions necessary for fixation of atmospheric nitrogen by\n\nRhizobium. What is their role in N\n2\n -fixation?\n\n9. What are the steps involved in formation of a root nodule?\n\n10. Which of the following statements are true? If false, correct them:\n\n(a) Boron deficiency leads to stout axis.\n\n(b) Every mineral element that is present in a cell is needed by the cell.\n\n(c) Nitrogen as a nutrient element, is highly immobile in the plants.\n\n(d) It is very easy to establish the essentiality of micronutrients because they\n\nare required only in trace quantities.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n\n')('status', 200)
