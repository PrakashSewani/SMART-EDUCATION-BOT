Majority of these\nstudies employed either surviving tissue model or straightaway cell-\nfree systems. An explosion of knowledge resulted in molecular biology.\nMolecular physiology became almost synonymous with biochemistry\nand biophysics. However, it is now being increasingly realised that\nneither a purely organismic approach nor a purely reductionistic\nmolecular approach would reveal the truth about biological processes\nor living phenomena. Systems biology makes us believe that all living\nphenomena are emergent properties due to interaction among\ncomponents of the system under study. Regulatory network of molecules,\nsupra molecular assemblies, cells, tissues, organisms and indeed,\npopulations and communities, each create emergent properties. In the\nchapters under this unit, major human physiological processes like\ndigestion, exchange of gases, blood circulation, locomotion and\nmovement are described in cellular and molecular terms.

The major\n\ncomponents of our food are carbohydrates, proteins and fats. Vitamins\n\nand minerals are also required in small quantities. Food provides energy\n\nand organic materials for growth and repair of tissues. The water we take\n\nin, plays an important role in metabolic processes and also prevents\n\ndehydration of the body. Biomacromolecules in food cannot be utilised\n\nby our body in their original form. They have to be broken down and\n\nconverted into simple substances in the digestive system. This process of\n\nconversion of complex food substances to simple absorbable forms is\n\ncalled digestion and is carried out by our digestive system by mechanical\n\nand biochemical methods. General organisation of the human digestive\n\nsystem is shown in Figure 16.1.\n\n16.1 DIGESTIVE SYSTEM\n\nThe human digestive system consists of the alimentary canal and the\n\nassociated glands.\n\n16.1.1 Alimentary Canal\n\nThe alimentary canal begins with an anterior opening – the mouth, and it\nopens out posteriorly through the anus. The mouth leads to the buccal\ncavity or oral cavity. The oral cavity has a number of teeth and a muscular\ntongue. Each tooth is embedded in a socket of jaw bone (Figure16.2).\nThis type of attachment is called thecodont. Majority of mammals\nincluding human being forms two sets of teeth during their life, a set of\ntemporary milk or deciduous teeth replaced by a set of permanent or\nadult teeth. This type of dentition is called diphyodont. An adult human\n\nDIGESTION AND ABSORPTION\n\nCHAPTER  16\n\n16.1 Digestive\n\nSystem\n\n16.2 Digestion of\n\nFood\n\n16.3 Absorption of\n\nDigested\n\nProducts\n\n16.4 Disorders of\n\nDigestive\n\nSystem\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n258 BIOLOGY\n\nSigmoid Colon\n\nFigure 16.1 The human digestive system\n\nhas 32 permanent teeth which are of four different types (Heterodont\n\ndentition), namely, incisors (I), canine (C), premolars (PM) and molars\n\n(M). Arrangement of teeth in each half of the upper and lower jaw in the\norder I, C, PM, M is represented by a dental formula which in human\n\nis \n2123\n\n2123\n. The hard chewing surface of the teeth, made up of enamel, helps\n\nin the mastication of food. The tongue is a freely movable muscular organ\n\nattached to the floor of the oral cavity by the frenulum. The upper surface\nof the tongue has small projections called papillae, some of which bear\n\ntaste buds.\n\nThe oral cavity leads into a short pharynx which serves as a common\npassage for food and air. The oesophagus and the trachea (wind pipe)\n\nopen into the pharynx. A cartilaginous flap called epiglottis prevents the\n\nentry of food into the glottis – opening of the wind pipe – during swallowing.\nThe oesophagus is a thin, long tube which extends posteriorly passing\n\nthrough the neck, thorax and diaphragm and leads to a ‘J’ shaped bag\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nDIGESTION AND ABSORPTION 259\n\nlike structure called stomach. A muscular\n\nsphincter (gastro-oesophageal) regulates the\n\nopening of oesophagus into the stomach.\nThe stomach, located in the upper left\n\nportion of the abdominal cavity, has four\n\nmajor parts – a cardiac portion into which\nthe oesophagus opens, a fundic region, body\n(main central region) and a pyloric portion\nwhich opens into the first part of small\nintestine (Figure 16.3). Small intestine is\n\ndistinguishable into three regions, a ‘C’\n\nshaped duodenum, a long coiled middle\nportion jejunum and a highly coiled ileum.\n\nThe opening of the stomach into the\n\nduodenum is guarded by the pyloric\nsphincter. Ileum opens into the large\n\nintestine. It consists of caecum, colon and\n\nrectum. Caecum is a small blind sac which\nhosts some symbiotic micro-organisms. A\n\nnarrow finger-like tubular projection, the\n\nvermiform appendix which is a vestigial\norgan, arises from the caecum. The caecum\n\nopens into the colon. The colon is divided\n\ninto four parts – an ascending, a transverse,\ndescending part and a sigmoid colon. The\n\ndescending part opens into the rectum\n\nwhich opens out through the anus.\nThe wall of alimentary canal from\n\noesophagus to rectum possesses four layers\n\n(Figure 16.4) namely serosa, muscularis,\nsub-mucosa and mucosa. Serosa is the\n\noutermost layer and is made up of a thin\n\nmesothelium (epithelium of visceral organs)\nwith some connective tissues. Muscularis is\n\nformed by smooth muscles usually\n\narranged into an inner circular and an outer\nlongitudinal layer. An oblique muscle layer\n\nmay be present in some regions. The sub-\n\nmucosal layer is formed of loose connective\ntissues containing nerves, blood and lymph\n\nvessels. In duodenum, glands are also\n\npresent in sub-mucosa. The innermost\nlayer lining the lumen of the alimentary\n\ncanal is the mucosa. This layer forms\n\nirregular folds (rugae) in the stomach and\nsmall finger-like foldings called villi in the\nsmall intestine (Figure 16.5). The cells lining\n\nthe villi produce numerous microscopic\n\nFigure 16.2 Arrangement of different types of\nteeth in the jaws on one side and\nthe sockets on the other side\n\nFigure 16.3 Anatomical regions of human\nstomach\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n260 BIOLOGY\n\nFigure 16.4 Diagrammatic representation of transverse section of gut\n\nprojections called microvilli giving a brush border\n\nappearance. These modifications increase the\n\nsurface area enormously. Villi are supplied with\na network of capillaries and a large lymph vessel\n\ncalled the lacteal. Mucosal epithelium has goblet\n\ncells which secrete mucus that help in lubrication.\nMucosa also forms glands in the stomach (gastric\n\nglands) and crypts in between the bases of villi in\n\nthe intestine (crypts of Lieberkuhn). All the four\nlayers show modifications in different parts of the\n\nalimentary canal.\n\n16.1.2 Digestive Glands\n\nThe digestive glands associated with the\nalimentary canal include the salivary glands, the\n\nliver and the pancreas.\n\nSaliva is mainly produced by three pairs of\nsalivary glands, the parotids (cheek), the sub-\n\nmaxillary/sub-mandibular (lower jaw) and the\n\nsub- linguals (below the tongue). These glands\nsituated just outside the buccal cavity secrete\n\nsalivary juice into the buccal cavity.\n\nLiver is the largest gland of the body weighing about 1.2 to 1.5 kg in\nan adult human. It is situated in the abdominal cavity, just below the\n\ndiaphragm and has two lobes. The hepatic lobules are the structural and\n\nfunctional units of liver containing hepatic cells arranged in the form of\ncords. Each lobule is covered by a thin connective tissue sheath called\n\nthe Glisson’s capsule. The bile secreted by the hepatic cells passes through\n\nthe hepatic ducts and is stored and concentrated in a thin muscular sac\ncalled the gall bladder. The duct of gall bladder (cystic duct) along with\n\nFigure 16.5 A section of small intestinal\nmucosa showing villi\n\nVilli\nLacteal\n\nCapillaries\n\nCrypts\n\nArtery\n\nVein\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nDIGESTION AND ABSORPTION 261\n\nthe hepatic duct from the liver forms the common bile duct (Figure 16.6).\n\nThe bile duct and the pancreatic duct open together into the duodenum\n\nas the common hepato-pancreatic duct which is guarded by a sphincter\ncalled the sphincter of Oddi.\n\nThe pancreas is a compound (both exocrine and endocrine) elongated\n\norgan situated between the limbs of the ‘C’ shaped duodenum. The\nexocrine portion secretes an alkaline pancreatic juice containing enzymes\n\nand the endocrine portion secretes hormones, insulin and glucagon.\n\nFigure 16.6 The duct systems of liver, gall bladder and pancreas\n\n16.2 DIGESTION OF FOOD\n\nThe process of digestion is accomplished by mechanical and chemical\n\nprocesses.\n\nThe buccal cavity performs two major functions, mastication of food\n\nand facilitation of swallowing. The teeth and the tongue with the help of\n\nsaliva masticate and mix up the food thoroughly. Mucus in saliva helps\n\nin lubricating and adhering the masticated food particles into a bolus.\n\nThe bolus is then conveyed into the pharynx and then into the oesophagus\n\nby swallowing or deglutition. The bolus further passes down through\n\nthe oesophagus by successive waves of muscular contractions called\n\nperistalsis. The gastro-oesophageal sphincter controls the passage of food\n\ninto the stomach.The saliva secreted into the oral cavity contains\n\nelectrolytes  and enzymes, salivary amylase and\n\nlysozyme. The chemical process of digestion is initiated in the oral cavity\n\nby the hydrolytic action of the carbohydrate splitting enzyme, the salivary\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n262 BIOLOGY\n\namylase. About 30 per cent of starch is hydrolysed here by this enzyme\n\n(optimum pH 6.8) into a disaccharide – maltose. Lysozyme present in\n\nsaliva acts as an antibacterial agent that prevents infections.\n\nStarch\nSalivary\n\n.\n\nAmylase\n\npH\nMaltose\n\n6 8\n\uf8e7 →\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\n\nThe mucosa of stomach has gastric glands. Gastric glands have three\n\nmajor types of cells namely -\n\n(i) mucus neck cells which secrete mucus;\n\n(ii) peptic or chief cells which secrete the proenzyme pepsinogen; and\n\n(iii) parietal or oxyntic cells which secrete HCl and intrinsic factor\n\n(factor essential for absorption of vitamin B\n12\n\n).\n\nThe stomach stores the food for 4-5 hours. The food mixes thoroughly\nwith the acidic gastric juice of the stomach by the churning movements\n\nof its muscular wall and is called the chyme. The proenzyme pepsinogen,\non exposure to hydrochloric acid gets converted into the active enzyme\npepsin, the proteolytic enzyme of the stomach. Pepsin converts proteins\n\ninto proteoses and peptones (peptides). The mucus and bicarbonates\n\npresent in the gastric juice play an important role in lubrication and\nprotection of the mucosal epithelium from excoriation by the highly\n\nconcentrated hydrochloric acid. HCl provides the acidic pH (pH 1.8)\n\noptimal for pepsins. Rennin is a proteolytic enzyme found in gastric juice\nof infants which helps in the digestion of milk proteins. Small amounts of\n\nlipases are also secreted by gastric glands.\n\nVarious types of movements are generated by the muscularis layer of\nthe small intestine. These movements help in a thorough mixing up of\n\nthe food with various secretions in the intestine and thereby facilitate\n\ndigestion. The bile, pancreatic juice and the intestinal juice are the\nsecretions released into the small intestine. Pancreatic juice and bile are\n\nreleased through the hepato-pancreatic duct. The pancreatic juice\n\ncontains inactive enzymes – trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen,\nprocarboxypeptidases, amylases, lipases and nucleases. Trypsinogen is\n\nactivated by an enzyme, enterokinase, secreted by the intestinal mucosa\n\ninto active trypsin, which in turn activates the other enzymes in the\npancreatic juice. The bile released into the duodenum contains bile\n\npigments (bilirubin and bili-verdin), bile salts, cholesterol and\n\nphospholipids but no enzymes. Bile helps in emulsification of fats, i.e.,\nbreaking down of the fats into very small micelles. Bile also activates lipases.\n\nThe intestinal mucosal epithelium has goblet cells which secrete\nmucus. The secretions of the brush border cells of the mucosa alongwith\nthe secretions of the goblet cells constitute the intestinal juice or\n\nsuccus entericus. This juice contains a variety of enzymes like\ndisaccharidases (e.g., maltase), dipeptidases, lipases, nucleosidases, etc.\nThe mucus alongwith the bicarbonates from the pancreas protects the\n\nintestinal mucosa from acid as well as provide an alkaline medium (pH\n\n7.8) for enzymatic activities. Sub-mucosal glands (Brunner’s glands) also\nhelp in this.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nDIGESTION AND ABSORPTION 263\n\nProteins, proteoses and peptones (partially hydrolysed proteins) in\n\nthe chyme reaching the intestine are acted upon by the proteolytic\nenzymes of pancreatic juice as given below:\n\nProteins\n\nPeptones\n\nProteoses\n\nTrypsin/Chymotrypsin\n\nCarboxyp\n\n\uf8fc\n\n\uf8fd\n\uf8f4\n\n\uf8fe\n\uf8f4\n\neeptidase\nDipeptides\uf8e7 →\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\n\nCarbohydrates in the chyme are hydrolysed by pancreatic amylase\n\ninto disaccharides.\n\nPolysaccharides starch Disaccharides\nAmylase\n\n( ) \uf8e7 →\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\n\nFats are broken down by lipases with the help of bile into di-and\n\nmonoglycerides.\n\nFats Diglycerides Monoglycerides\nLipases\n\n\uf8e7 →\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7 \uf8e7 →\uf8e7\n\nNucleases in the pancreatic juice acts on nucleic acids to form\n\nnucleotides and nucleosides\n\nNucleic acids Nucleotides Nucleosides\nNucleases\uf8e7 →\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7 \uf8e7 →\uf8e7\n\nThe enzymes  in the succus entericus act on the end products of the\n\nabove reactions to form the respective simple absorbable forms.

The simple substances thus\nformed are absorbed in the jejunum and ileum regions of the small\nintestine. The undigested and unabsorbed substances are passed on to\nthe large intestine.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n264 BIOLOGY\n\nNo significant digestive activity occurs in the large intestine. The\nfunctions of large intestine are:\n\n(i) absorption of some water, minerals and certain drugs;\n\n(ii) secretion of mucus which helps in adhering the waste (undigested)\nparticles together and lubricating it for an easy passage.\n\nThe undigested, unabsorbed substances called faeces enters into the caecum\nof the large intestine through ileo-caecal valve, which prevents the back flow of\nthe faecal matter.  It is temporarily stored in the rectum till defaecation.\n\nThe activities of the gastro-intestinal tract are under neural and\nhormonal control for proper coordination of different parts. The sight, smell\nand/or the presence of food in the oral cavity can stimulate the secretion of\nsaliva. Gastric and intestinal secretions are also, similarly, stimulated by\nneural signals. The muscular activities of different parts of the alimentary\ncanal can also  be moderated by neural mechanisms, both local and through\nCNS. Hormonal control of the secretion of digestive juices is carried out by\n\nlocal hormones produced by the gastric and intestinal mucosa.\n\nCALORIFIC VALUE OF PROTEIN, CARBOHYDRATE AND FAT\n\n(Boxed item – Not for evaluation)\n\n       The energy requirements of animals, and the energy content of food, are\nexpressed in terms of measure of heat energy because heat is the ultimate form\nof all energies. This is often measured to as calorie (cal) or joule (J), which is the\namount of heat energy required to raise the temperature of  1 g of water by 1 °C.\nSince this value is tiny amount of energy, physiologists commonly use kilocalorie\n(kcal) or kilo joule (kJ). One kilo calorie is the amount of energy required to raise\nthe temperature of 1 kg of water by 1 °C. Nutritionists, traditionally refer to kcal\nas the Calorie or Joule (always capitalised). The amount of heat liberated from\ncomplete combustion of 1 g food in a bomb calorimeter (a closed metal chamber\nfilled with O\n\n2\n) is its gross calorific or gross energy value. The actual amount of\n\nenergy combustion of 1 g of food is the physiologic value of food. Gross calorific\nvalues of carbohydrates, proteins and fats are 4.1 kcal/g, 5.65 kcal/g and 9.45\n\nkcal/g, respectively, whereas their physiologic values are 4.0 kcal/g, 4.0 kcal/g\n\nand 9.0 kcal/g, respectively.\n\n16.3 ABSORPTION OF DIGESTED PRODUCTS\n\nAbsorption is the process by which the end products of digestion pass\nthrough the intestinal mucosa into the blood or lymph. It is carried out by\npassive, active or facilitated transport mechanisms. Small amounts of\nmonosaccharides like glucose, amino acids and some electrolytes like\nchloride ions are generally absorbed by simple diffusion. The passage of\nthese substances into the blood depends upon the concentration gradients.\nHowever, some substances like glucose and amino acids are absorbed with\nthe help of carrier proteins. This mechanism is called the facilitated transport.\n\nTransport of water depends upon the osmotic gradient. Active\ntransport occurs against the concentration gradient and hence requires\nenergy. Various nutrients like amino acids, monosaccharides like glucose,\nelectrolytes like Na+ are absorbed into the blood by this mechanism.\n\nFatty acids and glycerol being insoluble, cannot be absorbed into the\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nDIGESTION AND ABSORPTION 265\n\nblood. They are first incorporated into small droplets called micelles which\nmove into the intestinal mucosa. They are re-formed into very small protein\ncoated fat globules called the chylomicrons which are transported into\nthe lymph vessels (lacteals) in the villi. These lymph vessels ultimately\nrelease the absorbed substances into the blood stream.\n\nAbsorption of substances takes place in different parts of the alimentary\ncanal, like mouth, stomach, small intestine and large intestine. However,\nmaximum absorption occurs in the small intestine. A summary of absorption\n(sites of absorption and substances absorbed) is given in Table 16.1.\n\nThe absorbed substances finally reach the tissues which utilise them\nfor their activities. This process is called assimilation.\n\nThe digestive wastes, solidified into coherent faeces in the rectum\ninitiate a neural reflex causing an urge or desire for its removal. The\negestion of faeces to the outside through the anal opening (defaecation) is\na voluntary process and is carried out by a mass peristaltic movement.\n\n16.4 DISORDERS OF DIGESTIVE SYSTEM\nThe inflammation of the intestinal tract is the most common ailment due\nto bacterial or viral infections. The infections are also caused by the\nparasites of the intestine like tapeworm, roundworm, threadworm,\nhookworm, pin worm, etc.\n\nJaundice: The liver is affected, skin and eyes turn yellow due to the\ndeposit of bile pigments.\n\nVomiting:  It is the ejection of stomach contents through the mouth.  This\nreflex action is controlled by the vomit centre in the medulla. A feeling of\nnausea precedes vomiting.\n\nDiarrhoea:  The abnormal frequency of bowel movement and increased\nliquidity of the faecal discharge is known as diarrhoea.  It reduces the\nabsorption of food.\n\nConstipation:  In constipation, the faeces are retained within the colon\nas the bowel movements occur irregularly.\n\nIndigestion:  In this condition, the food is not properly digested leading to\na feeling of fullness. The causes of indigestion are inadequate enzyme\nsecretion, anxiety, food poisoning, over eating, and spicy food.\n\nStomach\n\nAbsorption of\nwater, simple\nsugars, and\nalcohol etc.\ntakes place.\n\nSmall Intestine\n\nPrincipal organ for absorption\nof nutrients.  The digestion is\ncompleted here and the final\nproducts of digestion such as\nglucose, fructose, fatty acids,\nglycerol and amino acids are\nabsorbed through the mucosa\ninto the blood stream and\nlymph.\n\nMouth\n\nCertain drugs\ncoming in contact\nwith the mucosa\nof mouth and\nlower side of the\ntongue are\nabsorbed into the\nblood capillaries\nlining them.\n\nLarge Intestine\n\nAbsorption of\nwater, some\nminerals and\ndrugs takes\nplace.\n\nTABLE 16.1 The Summary of Absorption in Different Parts of Digestive System\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n266 BIOLOGY\n\nPEM\n\nDietary deficiencies of proteins and total food calories are widespread in\n\nmany underdeveloped countries of South and South-east Asia, South\n\nAmerica, and West and Central Africa. Protein-energy malnutrition\n\n(PEM) may affect large sections of the population during drought, famine\n\nand political turmoil. This happened in Bangladesh during the liberation\n\nwar and in Ethiopia during the severe drought in mid-eighties. PEM affects\n\ninfants and children to produce Marasmus and Kwashiorkar.\n\nMarasmus is produced by a simultaneous deficiency of proteins and\n\ncalories. It is found in infants less than a year in age, if mother’s milk is\n\nreplaced too early by other foods which are poor in both proteins and\n\ncaloric value. This often happens if the mother has second pregnancy or\n\nchildbirth when the older infant is still too young. In Marasmus, protein\n\ndeficiency impairs growth and replacement of tissue proteins; extreme\n\nemaciation of the body and thinning of limbs results, the skin becomes\n\ndry, thin and wrinkled. Growth rate and body weight decline considerably.\n\nEven growth and development of brain and mental faculties are impaired.\n\nKwashiorkar is produced by protein deficiency unaccompanied by calorie\n\ndeficiency. It results from the replacement of mother’s milk by a high calorie-\n\nlow protein diet in a child more than one year in age. Like marasmus,\n\nkwashiorkor shows wasting of muscles, thinning of limbs, failure of growth\n\nand brain development. But unlike marasmus, some fat is still left under\n\nthe skin; moreover, extensive oedema and swelling of body parts are seen.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe digestive system of humans consists of an alimentary canal and\nassociated digestive glands. The alimentary canal consists of the mouth,\nbuccal cavity, pharynx, oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, large\nintestine, rectum and the anus. The accessory digestive glands include the\nsalivary glands, the liver (with gall bladder) and the pancreas. Inside the\nmouth the teeth masticates the food, the tongue tastes the food and\nmanipulates it for proper mastication by mixing with the saliva. Saliva\ncontains a starch digestive enzyme, salivary amylase that digests the starch\nand converts it into maltose (disaccharide). The food then passes into the\npharynx and enters the oesophagus in the form of bolus, which is further\ncarried down through the oesophagus by peristalsis into the stomach. In\nstomach mainly protein digestion takes place. Absorption of simple sugars,\nalcohol and medicines also takes place in the stomach.\n\nThe chyme (food) enters into the duodenum portion of the small\nintestine and is acted on by the pancreatic juice, bile and finally by the\nenzymes in the succus entericus, so that the digestion of carbohydrates,\nproteins and fats is completed. The food then enters into the jejunum and\nileum portions of the small intestine. Carbohydrates are digested and\nconverted into monosaccharides like glucose. Proteins are finally broken\ndown into amino acids. The fats are converted to fatty acids and glycerol.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nDIGESTION AND ABSORPTION 267\n\nThe digested end products are absorbed into the body through the epithelial lining\nof the intestinal villi. The undigested food (faeces) enters into the caecum of the large\nintestine through ileo-caecal valve, which prevents the back flow of the faecal matter.\nMost of the water is absorbed in the large intestine. The undigested food becomes\nsemi-solid in nature and then enters into the rectum, anal canal and is finally egested\n\nout through the anus.\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1.
