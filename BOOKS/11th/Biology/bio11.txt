The two perspectives essentially rested on two levels of\n\norganisation of life forms and phenomena. One described at organismic\n\nand above level of organisation while the second described at cellular\n\nand molecular level of organisation. The first resulted in ecology and\n\nrelated disciplines. The second resulted in physiology and biochemistry.\n\nDescription of physiological processes, in flowering plants as an\n\nexample, is what is given in the chapters in this unit. The processes of\n\nmineral nutrition of plants, photosynthesis, transport, respiration and\n\nultimately plant growth and development are described in molecular\n\nterms but in the context of cellular activities and even at organism\n\nlevel. Wherever appropriate, the relation of the physiological processes\n\nto environment is also discussed.\n\nPLANT PHYSIOLOGY\n\nChapter 11\nTransport in Plants\n\nChapter 12\nMineral Nutrition\n\nChapter 13\nPhotosynthesis in Higher\nPlants\n\nChapter 14\nRespiration in Plants\n\nChapter 15\nPlant Growth and\nDevelopment\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMELVIN CALVIN born in Minnesota in April, 1911, received his\n\nPh.D. in Chemistry from the University of Minnesota. He served\n\nas Professor of Chemistry at the University of California,\n\nBerkeley.\n\nJust after world war II, when the world was under shock\n\nafter the Hiroshima-Nagasaki bombings, and seeing the ill-\n\neffects of radio-activity, Calvin and co-workers put radio-\n\nactivity to beneficial use. He along with J.A. Bassham studied\n\nreactions in green plants forming sugar and other substances\n\nfrom raw materials like carbon dioxide, water and minerals\n\nby labelling the carbon dioxide with C\n14\n\n. Calvin proposed that\n\nplants change light energy to chemical energy by transferring\n\nan electron in an organised array of pigment molecules and\n\nother substances. The mapping of the pathway of carbon\n\nassimilation in photosynthesis earned him Nobel Prize in 1961.\n\nThe principles of photosynthesis as established by Calvin\n\nare, at present, being used in studies on renewable resource\n\nfor energy and materials and basic studies in solar energy\n\nresearch.Melvin Calvin\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nHave you ever wondered how water reaches the top of tall trees, or for that\n\nmatter how and why substances move from one cell to the other, whether\n\nall substances move in a similar way, in the same direction and whether\n\nmetabolic energy is required for moving substances.  Plants need to move\n\nmolecules over very long distances, much more than animals do; they also\n\ndo not have a circulatory system in place.  Water taken up by the roots has\n\nto reach all parts of the plant, up to the very tip of the growing stem.  The\n\nphotosynthates or food synthesised by the leaves have also to be moved to\n\nall parts including the root tips embedded deep inside the soil.  Movement\n\nacross short distances, say within the cell, across the membranes and from\n\ncell to cell within the tissue has also to take place. To understand some of\n\nthe transport processes that take place in plants, one would have to recollect\n\none’s basic knowledge about the structure of the cell and the anatomy of\n\nthe plant body.  We also need to revisit our understanding of diffusion,\n\nbesides gaining some knowledge about chemical potential and ions.\n\nWhen we talk of the movement of substances we need first to define\n\nwhat kind of movement we are talking about, and also what substances\n\nwe are looking at. In a flowering plant the substances that would need to\n\nbe transported are water, mineral nutrients, organic nutrients and plant\n\ngrowth regulators. Over small distances substances move by diffusion\n\nand by cytoplasmic streaming supplemented by active transport.\n\nTransport over longer distances proceeds through the vascular system\n\n(the xylem and the phloem) and is called translocation.\n\nAn important aspect that needs to be considered is the direction of\n\ntransport. In rooted plants, transport in xylem (of water and minerals) is\n\nessentially unidirectional, from roots to the stems. Organic and mineral\n\nnutrients however, undergo multidirectional transport. Organic\n\nTRANSPORT IN PLANTS\n\nCHAPTER  11\n\n11.1 Means of\n\nTransport\n\n11.2 Plant-Water\n\nRelations\n\n11.3 Long Distance\n\nTransport of\n\nWater\n\n11.4 Transpiration\n\n11.5 Uptake and\n\nTransport of\n\nMineral\n\nNutrients\n\n11.6   Phloem\n\nTransport: Flow\n\nfrom Source to\n\nSink\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n176 BIOLOGY\n\ncompounds synthesised in the photosynthetic leaves are exported to all\n\nother parts of the plant including storage organs.  From the storage organs\n\nthey are later re-exported.  The mineral nutrients are taken up by the\n\nroots and transported upwards into the stem, leaves and the growing\n\nregions.  When any plant part undergoes senescence, nutrients may be\n\nwithdrawn from such regions and moved to the growing parts.  Hormones\n\nor plant growth regulators and other chemical signals are also transported,\n\nthough in very small amounts, sometimes in a strictly polarised or\n\nunidirectional manner from where they are synthesised to other parts.\n\nHence, in a flowering plant there is a complex traffic of compounds (but\n\nprobably very orderly) moving in different directions, each organ receiving\n\nsome substances and giving out some others.\n\n11.1 MEANS OF TRANSPORT\n\n11.1.1 Diffusion\n\nMovement by diffusion is passive, and may be from one part of the cell to\n\nthe other, or from cell to cell, or over short distances, say, from the inter-\n\ncellular spaces of the leaf to the outside.  No energy expenditure takes place.\n\nIn diffusion, molecules move in a random fashion, the net result being\n\nsubstances moving from regions of higher concentration to regions of lower\n\nconcentration.  Diffusion is a slow process and is not dependent on a ‘living\n\nsystem’. Diffusion is obvious in gases and liquids, but diffusion in solids is\n\nmore likely rather than of solids. Diffusion is very important to plants since\n\nit is the only means for gaseous movement within the plant body.\n\nDiffusion rates are affected by the gradient of concentration, the\n\npermeability of the membrane separating them, temperature and pressure.\n\n11.1.2 Facilitated Diffusion\n\nAs pointed out earlier, a gradient must already be present for diffusion to\n\noccur.  The diffusion rate depends on the size of the substances; obviously\n\nsmaller substances diffuse faster.  The diffusion of any substance across a\n\nmembrane also depends on its solubility in lipids, the major constituent of\n\nthe membrane. Substances soluble in lipids diffuse through the membrane\n\nfaster.  Substances that have a hydrophilic moiety, find it difficult to pass\n\nthrough the membrane; their movement has to be facilitated.  Membrane\n\nproteins provide sites at which such molecules cross the membrane.  They\n\ndo not set up a concentration gradient: a concentration gradient must\n\nalready be present for molecules to diffuse even if facilitated by the proteins.\n\nThis process is called facilitated diffusion.\n\nIn facilitated diffusion special proteins help move substances across\n\nmembranes without expenditure of ATP energy. Facilitated diffusion\n\ncannot cause net transport of molecules from a low to a high concentration\n\n– this would require input of energy.   Transport rate reaches a maximum\n\nwhen all of the protein transporters are being used (saturation).  Facilitated\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTRANSPORT IN PLANTS 177\n\ndiffusion is very specific: it allows cell to\n\nselect substances for uptake.  It is\n\nsensitive to inhibitors which react with\n\nprotein side chains.\n\nThe proteins form channels in the\n\nmembrane for molecules to pass through.\n\nSome channels are always open; others\n\ncan be controlled.  Some are large,\n\nallowing a variety of molecules to cross.\n\nThe porins are proteins that form large\n\npores in the outer membranes of the\n\nplastids, mitochondria and some bacteria\n\nallowing molecules up to the size of small\n\nproteins to pass through.\n\nFigure 11.1 shows an extracellular\n\nmolecule bound to the transport protein;\n\nthe transport protein then rotates and\n\nreleases the molecule inside the cell, e.g.,\n\nwater channels – made up of eight\n\ndifferent types of aquaporins.\n\n11.1.2.1 Passive symports and\n\nantiports\n\nSome carrier or transport proteins allow\n\ndiffusion only if two types of molecules\n\nmove together. In a symport, both\n\nmolecules cross the membrane in the same\n\ndirection; in an antiport, they move in\n\nopposite directions (Figure 11.2). When a\n\nFigure 11.1 Facilitated diffusion\n\nUniport\n\nCarrier protein\n\nMembrane\n\nAntiport\n\nSymport\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nB\n\nB\n\nFigure 11.2 Facilitated diffusion\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n178 BIOLOGY\n\nmolecule moves across a membrane independent of other molecules, the\n\nprocess is called uniport.\n\n11.1.3 Active Transport\n\nActive transport uses energy to transport and pump molecules against a\n\nconcentration gradient. Active transport is carried out by specific\n\nmembrane-proteins. Hence different proteins in the membrane play a\n\nmajor role in both active as well as passive transport. Pumps are proteins\n\nthat use energy to carry substances across the cell membrane. These\n\npumps can transport substances from a low concentration to a high\n\nconcentration (‘uphill’ transport).  Transport rate reaches a maximum\n\nwhen all the protein transporters are being used or are saturated.  Like\n\nenzymes the carrier protein is very specific in what it carries across the\n\nmembrane.  These proteins are sensitive to inhibitors that react with protein\n\nside chains.\n\n11.1.4 Comparison of Different Transport Processes\n\nTable 11.1 gives a comparison of the different transport mechanisms.\n\nProteins in the membrane are responsible for facilitated diffusion and\n\nactive transport and hence show common characterstics of being highly\n\nselective; they are liable to saturate, respond to inhibitors and are under\n\nhormonal regulation.  But diffusion whether facilitated or not – take place\n\nonly along a gradient and do not use energy.\n\nTABLE 11.1 Comparison of Different Transport Mechanisms\n\nProperty Simple Facilitated Active\nDiffusion Transport Transport\n\nRequires special membrane proteins  No  Yes  Yes\n\nHighly selective  No  Yes  Yes\n\nTransport saturates  No  Yes  Yes\n\nUphill transport  No  No  Yes\n\nRequires ATP energy  No  No  Yes\n\n11.2 PLANT-WATER RELATIONS\n\nWater is essential for all physiological activities of the plant and plays a\n\nvery important role in all living organisms.  It provides the medium in\n\nwhich most substances are dissolved. The protoplasm of the cells is\n\nnothing but water in which different molecules are dissolved and (several\n\nparticles) suspended. A watermelon has over 92 per cent water; most\n\nherbaceous plants have only about 10 to 15 per cent of its fresh weight\n\nas dry matter. Of course, distribution of water within a plant varies –\n\nwoody parts have relatively very little water, while soft parts mostly contain\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTRANSPORT IN PLANTS 179\n\nwater.  A seed may appear dry but it still has water – otherwise it would\n\nnot be alive and respiring!\n\nTerrestrial plants take up huge amount water daily but most of it is\n\nlost to the air through evaporation from the leaves, i.e., transpiration. A\n\nmature corn plant absorbs almost three litres of water in a day, while a\n\nmustard plant absorbs water equal to its own weight in about 5 hours.\n\nBecause of this high demand for water, it is not surprising that water is\n\noften the limiting factor for plant growth and productivity in both\n\nagricultural and natural environments.\n\n11.2.1 Water Potential\n\nTo comprehend plant-water relations, an understanding of certain\n\nstandard terms is necessary. Water potential (ΨΨΨΨΨ\nw\n) is a concept\n\nfundamental to understanding water movement.  Solute potential\n\n(ΨΨΨΨΨ\ns\n) and pressure potential (ΨΨΨΨΨ\n\np\n) are the two main components that\n\ndetermine water potential.\n\nWater molecules possess kinetic energy. In liquid and gaseous form\n\nthey are in  random motion that is both rapid and constant. The greater\n\nthe concentration of water in a system, the greater is its kinetic energy or\n\n‘water potential’.  Hence, it is obvious that pure water will have the greatest\n\nwater potential.  If two systems containing water are in contact, random\n\nmovement of water molecules will result in net movement of water\n\nmolecules from the system with higher energy to the one with lower energy.\n\nThus water will move from the system containing water at higher water\n\npotential\n \nto the one having low water potential\n\n.  \nThis process of movement\n\nof substances down a gradient of free energy is called diffusion. Water\n\npotential is denoted by the Greek symbol Psi or ΨΨΨΨΨ and is expressed in\n\npressure units such as pascals (Pa).  By convention, the water potential\n\nof pure water at standard temperatures, which is not under any pressure,\n\nis taken to be zero.\n\nIf some solute is dissolved in pure water, the solution has fewer free\n\nwater molecules and the concentration (free energy) of water decreases,\n\nreducing its water potential. Hence, all solutions have a lower water potential\n\nthan pure water; the magnitude of this lowering due to dissolution of a\n\nsolute is called solute potential or ΨΨΨΨΨ\ns\n.\n \n ΨΨΨΨΨ\n\ns \n is always negative.  The more\n\nthe solute molecules, the lower (more negative) is the Ψ\ns \n.\n \nFor a solution at\n\natmospheric pressure (water potential) Ψ\nw \n\n= (solute potential) \n \nΨ\n\ns\n.\n\nIf a pressure greater than atmospheric pressure is applied to pure\n\nwater or a solution, its water potential increases. It is equivalent to\n\npumping water from one place to another. Can you think of any system\n\nin our body where pressure is built up? Pressure can build up in a plant\n\nsystem\n \nwhen water enters a plant cell due to diffusion causing a pressure\n\nbuilt up against the cell wall, it makes the cell turgid (see section 11.2.2);\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n180 BIOLOGY\n\nthis increases the pressure potential. Pressure potential is usually\n\npositive, though in plants negative potential or tension in the water column\nin the xylem plays a major role in water transport up a stem.  Pressure\n\npotential is denoted as ΨΨΨΨΨp.\n\nWater potential of a cell is affected by both solute and pressure\npotential.  The relationship between them is as follows:\n\nΨΨΨΨΨ\nw \n\n= ΨΨΨΨΨ\ns \n+ ΨΨΨΨΨ\n\np\n\n11.2.2 Osmosis\n\nThe plant cell is surrounded by a cell membrane and a cell wall.  The cell\n\nwall is freely permeable to water and substances in solution hence is not\n\na barrier to movement. In plants the cells usually contain a large central\n\nvacuole, whose contents, the vacuolar sap, contribute to the solute\n\npotential of the cell. In plant cells, the cell membrane and the membrane\n\nof the vacuole, the tonoplast together are important determinants of\n\nmovement of molecules in or out of  the cell.\n\nOsmosis is the term used to refer specifically to the diffusion of water across\n\na differentially- or selectively permeable membrane. Osmosis occurs\n\nspontaneously in response to a driving force. The net direction and rate of osmosis\n\ndepends on both the pressure gradient and concentration gradient.  Water\n\nwill move from its region of higher chemical  potential (or concentration)  to its\n\nregion of lower chemical potential until equilibrium is reached. At equilibrium\n\nthe two chambers should have nearly the same water potential.\n\nYou may have made a potato osmometer in your earlier classes in\n\nschool. If the potato tuber is placed in water, the water enters the cavity in\n\nthe potato tuber containing a concentrated solution of sugar due to osmosis.\n\nStudy Figure 11.3 in which the two chambers, A and B, containing\n\nsolutions are separated by a semi-permeable membrane.\n\n(a) Solution of  which chamber has a lower water potential?\n\n(b) Solution of  which chamber has a lower solute potential?\n\n(c) In which direction will osmosis occur?\n\n(d) Which solution has a higher solute\n\npotential?\n\n(e) At equilibrium which chamber will\n\nhave lower water potential?\n\n(f) If one chamber has a Ψ Ψ Ψ Ψ Ψ of – 2000\n\nkPa, and the other – 1000 kPa, which\n\nis the chamber that has the higher\n\nΨΨΨΨΨ?\n\n(g) What will be the direction of the\nmovement of water when two\nsolutions with  Ψ\n\nw \n= 0.2 MPa and\n\nΨ\nw \n\n= 0.1 MPa are separated by a\nselectively permeable membrane?\n\nFigure 11.3\n\nA B\n\nSolute\nmolecule\n\nWater\n\nSemi-permeableSelectively permeable\nmembrane\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTRANSPORT IN PLANTS 181\n\nLet us discuss another experiment where a\n\nsolution of sucrose in water taken in a funnel is\n\nseparated from pure water in a beaker by a\n\nselectively permeable membrane (Figure 11.4).\n\nYou can get this kind of a membrane in an egg.\n\nRemove the yolk and albumin through a small\n\nhole at one end of the egg, and place the shell\n\nin dilute solution of hydrochloric acid for a few\n\nhours. The egg shell dissolves leaving the\n\nmembrane intact. Water will move into the funnel,\n\nresulting in rise in the level of the solution in the\n\nfunnel. This will continue till the equilibrium is\n\nreached. In case sucrose does diffuse out\n\nthrough the membrane, will this equilibrium be\n\never reached?\n\nExternal pressure can be applied from the\n\nupper part of the funnel such that no water\n\ndiffuses into the funnel through the membrane.\n\nThis pressure required to prevent water from\n\ndiffusing is in fact, the osmotic pressure and this\n\nis the function of the solute concentration; more\n\nthe solute concentration, greater will be the\n\npressure required to prevent water from diffusing\n\nin. Numerically osmotic pressure is equivalent\n\nto the osmotic potential, but the sign is\n\nopposite.Osmotic pressure is the positive\n\npressure applied, while osmotic potential is\n\nnegative.\n\n11.2.3 Plasmolysis\n\nThe behaviour of the plant cells (or tissues) with\n\nregard to water movement depends on the\n\nsurrounding solution. If the external solution\n\nbalances the osmotic pressure of the cytoplasm,\n\nit is said to be isotonic.  If the external solution\n\nis more dilute than the cytoplasm, it is\n\nhypotonic and if the external solution is more\n\nconcentrated, it is hypertonic. Cells swell in\n\nhypotonic solutions and shrink in hypertonic\n\nones.\n\nPlasmolysis occurs when water moves out of\n\nthe cell and the cell membrane of a plant cell\n\nshrinks away from its cell wall.  This occurs when\n\nFigure 11.4 A demonstration of osmosis. A\nthistle funnel is filled with\nsucrose solution and kept\ninverted in a beaker containing\nwater. (a) Water will diffuse\nacross the membrane (as\nshown by arrows) to raise the\nlevel of the solution in the\nfunnel (b) Pressure can be\napplied as shown to stop the\nwater movement into the\nfunnel\n\nSucrose\nsolution\n\nMembrane\n\nwater\n\n(a) (b)\n\nPressure\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n182 BIOLOGY\n\nthe cell (or tissue) is placed in a solution that is hypertonic (has more solutes)\n\nto the protoplasm. Water moves out; it is first lost from  the cytoplasm and\n\nthen from the vacuole. The water when drawn out of the cell through\n\ndiffusion into the extracellular (outside cell) fluid causes the protoplast to\n\nshrink away from the walls. The cell is said to be plasmolysed. The movement\n\nof water occurred across the membrane moving from an area of high water\n\npotential (i.e., the cell) to an area of lower water potential outside the cell\n\n(Figure 11.5).  \n\nWhat occupies the space between the cell wall and the shrunken\n\nprotoplast in the plasmolysed cell?\n\nWhen the cell (or tissue) is placed in an isotonic solution, there is no\n\nnet flow of water towards the inside or outside.  If the external solution\n\nbalances the osmotic pressure of the cytoplasm it is said to be isotonic.\n\nWhen water flows into the cell and out of the cell and are in equilibrium,\n\nthe cells are said to be flaccid. \n\nThe process of plasmolysis is usually reversible. When the cells are\n\nplaced in a hypotonic solution (higher water potential or dilute solution\n\nas compared to the cytoplasm), water diffuses into the cell causing the\n\ncytoplasm to build up a pressure against the wall, that is called turgor\n\npressure. The pressure exerted by the protoplasts due to entry of water\n\nagainst the rigid walls is called pressure potential ΨΨΨΨΨ\np.\n. Because of the\n\nrigidity of the cell wall, the cell does not rupture.  This turgor pressure is\n\nultimately responsible for enlargement and extension growth of cells.\n\nWhat would be the ΨΨΨΨΨ\np\n of a flaccid cell? Which organisms other than\n\nplants possess cell wall ?\n\n11.2.4 Imbibition\n\nImbibition is a special type of diffusion when water is absorbed by\n\nsolids – colloids – causing them to increase in volume.  The classical\n\nFigure 11.5 Plant cell plasmolysis\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTRANSPORT IN PLANTS 183\n\nexamples of imbibition are absorption of water by seeds and dry wood.\n\nThe pressure that is produced by the swelling of wood had been used by\n\nprehistoric man to split rocks and boulders.  If it were not for the pressure\n\ndue to imbibition, seedlings would not have been able to emerge out of\n\nthe soil into the open; they probably would not have been able to establish!\n\nImbibition is also diffusion since water movement is along a\n\nconcentration gradient; the seeds and other such materials have almost no\n\nwater hence they absorb water easily.  Water potential gradient between\n\nthe absorbent and the liquid imbibed is essential for imbibition.  In addition,\n\nfor any substance to imbibe any liquid, affinity between the adsorbant and\n\nthe liquid is also a pre-requisite.\n\n11.3 LONG DISTANCE TRANSPORT OF WATER\n\nAt some earlier stage you might have carried out an experiment where\n\nyou had placed a twig bearing white flowers in coloured water and had\n\nwatched it turn colour. On examining the cut end of the twig after a few\n\nhours you had noted the region through which the coloured water moved.\n\nThat experiment very easily demonstrates that the path of water movement\n\nis through the vascular bundles, more specifically, the xylem. Now we\n\nhave to go further and try and understand the mechanism of movement\n\nof water and other substances up a plant.\n\nLong distance transport of substances within a plant cannot be by\n\ndiffusion alone.  Diffusion is a slow process. It can account for only short\n\ndistance movement of molecules. For example, the movement of a molecule\n\nacross a typical plant cell (about 50 µm) takes approximately 2.5 s. At this\n\nrate, can you calculate how many years it would take for the movement\n\nof molecules over a distance of 1 m within a plant by diffusion alone?\n\nIn large and complex organisms, often substances have to be moved\n\nto long distances. Sometimes the sites of production or absorption and\n\nsites of storage are too far from each other; diffusion or active transport\n\nwould not suffice. Special long distance transport systems become\n\nnecessary so as to move substances across long distances and at a much\n\nfaster rate. Water and minerals, and food are generally moved by a mass\n\nor bulk flow system. Mass flow is the movement of substances in bulk or\n\nen masse from one point to another as a result of pressure differences\n\nbetween the two points. It is a characteristic of mass flow that substances,\n\nwhether in solution or in suspension, are swept along at the same pace,\n\nas in a flowing river. This is unlike diffusion where different substances\n\nmove independently depending on their concentration gradients. Bulk\n\nflow can be achieved either through a positive hydrostatic pressure\n\ngradient (e.g., a garden hose) or a negative hydrostatic pressure gradient\n\n(e.g., suction through a straw).\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n184 BIOLOGY\n\nThe bulk movement of substances through the conducting or vascular\n\ntissues of plants is called translocation.\n\nDo you remember studying cross sections of roots, stems and leaves\n\nof higher plants and studying the vascular system? The higher plants\n\nhave highly specialised vascular tissues – xylem and phloem. Xylem is\n\nassociated with translocation of mainly water, mineral salts, some organic\n\nnitrogen and hormones, from roots to the aerial parts of the plants. The\n\nphloem translocates a variety of organic and inorganic solutes, mainly\n\nfrom the leaves to other parts of the plants.\n\n11.3.1 How do Plants Absorb Water?\n\nWe know that the roots absorb most of the water that goes into plants;\n\nobviously that is why we apply water to the soil and not on the leaves.\n\nThe responsibility of absorption of water and minerals is more specifically\n\nthe function of the root hairs that are present in millions at the tips of the\n\nroots.  Root hairs are thin-walled slender extensions of root epidermal\n\ncells that greatly increase the surface area for absorption.  Water is\n\nabsorbed along with mineral solutes, by the root hairs, purely by diffusion.\n\nOnce water is absorbed by the root hairs, it can move deeper into root\n\nlayers by two distinct pathways:\n\n• apoplast pathway\n\n• symplast pathway\n\nThe apoplast is the system of adjacent cell walls that is continuous\n\nthroughout the plant, except at the casparian strips of the endodermis\n\nin the roots (Figure 11.6).  The apoplastic movement of water occurs\n\nexclusively through the intercellular spaces and the walls of the cells.\n\nMovement through the apoplast does not involve crossing the cell\n\nFigure 11.6 Pathway of water movement in the root\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTRANSPORT IN PLANTS 185\n\nmembrane. This movement is dependent on the gradient. The apoplast\n\ndoes not provide any barrier to water movement and water movement is\n\nthrough mass flow.  As water evaporates into the intercellular spaces or\n\nthe atmosphere, tension develop in the continuous stream of water in the\n\napoplast, hence mass flow of water occurs due to the adhesive and cohesive\n\nproperties of water.\n\nThe symplastic system is the system of interconnected protoplasts.\n\nNeighbouring cells are connected through cytoplasmic strands that\n\nextend through plasmodesmata.  During symplastic movement, the water\n\ntravels through the cells – their  cytoplasm; intercellular movement is\n\nthrough the plasmodesmata.  Water has to enter the cells through the\n\ncell membrane, hence the movement is relatively slower. Movement is again\n\ndown a potential gradient.  Symplastic movement may be aided by\n\ncytoplasmic streaming. You may have observed cytoplasmic streaming\n\nin cells of the Hydrilla leaf; the movement of chloroplast due to streaming\n\nis easily visible.\n\nMost of the water flow in the roots occurs via the apoplast since the\n\ncortical cells are loosely packed, and hence offer no resistance to water\n\nmovement.  However, the inner boundary of the cortex, the endodermis,\n\nis impervious to water because of a band of suberised  matrix called the\n\ncasparian strip.  Water molecules are unable to penetrate the layer, so\n\nthey are directed to wall regions that are not suberised, into the cells\n\nproper through the membranes. The water then moves through the\n\nsymplast and again crosses a membrane to reach the cells of the xylem.\n\nThe movement of water through the root layers is ultimately symplastic\n\nin the endodermis. This is the only\n\nway water and other solutes can\n\nenter the vascular cylinder.\n\nOnce inside the xylem, water is\n\nagain free to move between cells as\n\nwell as through them. In young\n\nroots, water enters directly into the\n\nxylem vessels and/or tracheids.\n\nThese are non-living conduits and\n\nso are parts of the apoplast. The\n\npath of water and mineral ions into\n\nthe root vascular system is\n\nsummarised in Figure 11.7.\n\nSome plants have additional\n\nstructures associated with them\n\nthat help in water (and mineral)\n\nabsorption. A mycorrhiza is a\n\nsymbiotic association of a fungus\n\nwith a root system.

The hyphae have a very large surface area that absorb mineral\n\nions and water from the soil from a much larger volume of soil that perhaps\n\na root cannot do. The fungus provides minerals and water to the roots, in\n\nturn the roots provide sugars and N-containing compounds to the\n\nmycorrhizae. Some plants have an obligate association with the\n\nmycorrhizae.  For example, Pinus seeds cannot germinate and establish\n\nwithout the presence of mycorrhizae.\n\n11.3.2 Water Movement up a Plant\n\nWe looked at how plants absorb water from the soil, and move it into the\n\nvascular tissues. We now have to try and understand how this water is\n\ntransported to various parts of the plant. Is the water movement active, or\n\nis it still passive? Since the water has to be moved up a stem against\n\ngravity, what provides the energy for this?\n\n11.3.2.1 Root Pressure\n\nAs various ions from the soil are actively transported into the vascular\n\ntissues of the roots, water follows (its potential gradient) and increases\n\nthe pressure inside the xylem.  This positive pressure is called root\n\npressure, and can be responsible for pushing up water to small heights\n\nin the stem.  How can we see that root pressure exists? Choose a small\n\nsoft-stemmed plant and on a day, when there is plenty of atmospheric\n\nmoisture, cut the stem horizontally near the base with a sharp blade,\n\nearly in the morning.  You will soon see drops of solution ooze out of the\n\ncut stem; this comes out due to the positive root pressure. If you fix a\n\nrubber tube to the cut stem as a sleeve you can actually collect and\n\nmeasure the rate of exudation, and also determine the composition of the\n\nexudates.  Effects of root pressure is also observable at night and early\n\nmorning when evaporation is low, and excess water collects in the form of\n\ndroplets around special openings of veins near the tip of grass blades,\n\nand leaves of many herbaceous parts.  Such water loss in its liquid phase\n\nis known as guttation.\n\nRoot pressure can, at best, only provide a modest push in the overall\n\nprocess of water transport. They obviously do not play a major role in\n\nwater movement up tall trees.  The greatest contribution of root pressure\n\nmay be to re-establish the continuous chains of water molecules in the\n\nxylem which often break under the enormous tensions created by\n\ntranspiration. Root pressure does not account for the majority of water\n\ntransport; most plants meet their need by transpiratory pull.\n\n11.3.2.2 Transpiration pull\n\nDespite the absence of a heart or a circulatory system in plants, the\n\nupward flow of water through the xylem in plants can achieve fairly high\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTRANSPORT IN PLANTS 187\n\nrates, up to 15 metres per hour. How is this movement accomplished? A\n\nlong standing question is, whether water is ‘pushed’ or ‘pulled’ through\n\nthe plant. Most researchers agree that water is mainly ‘pulled’ through\n\nthe plant, and that the driving force for this process is transpiration from\n\nthe leaves. This is referred to as the cohesion-tension-transpiration\n\npull model of water transport. But, what generates this transpirational pull?\n\nWater is transient in plants. Less than 1 per cent of the water reaching\n\nthe leaves is used in photosynthesis and plant growth. Most of it is lost\n\nthrough the stomata in the leaves. This water loss is known as\n\ntranspiration.\n\nYou have studied transpiration in an earlier class by enclosing a healthy\n\nplant in polythene bag and observing the droplets of water formed inside\n\nthe bag.  You could also study water loss from a leaf using cobalt chloride\n\npaper, which turns colour on absorbing water.\n\n11.4 TRANSPIRATION\n\nTranspiration is the evaporative loss of water by plants. It occurs mainly\n\nthrough stomata (sing. : stoma). Besides  the loss of water vapour in\n\ntranspiration, exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the leaf also occurs\n\nthrough these stomata.  Normally stomata are open in the day time and\n\nclose during the night. The immediate cause of the opening or closing of\n\nstomata is a change in the turgidity of the guard cells. The inner wall of\n\neach guard cell, towards the pore or stomatal aperture, is thick and elastic.\n\nWhen turgidity increases within the two guard cells flanking each stomatal\n\naperture or pore, the thin outer walls bulge out and force the inner walls\n\ninto a crescent shape. The opening of the stoma is also aided due to the\n\norientation of the microfibrils in the cell walls of the guard cells. Cellulose\n\nmicrofibrils are oriented radially rather than longitudinally making it easier\n\nfor the stoma to open.  When the guard cells lose turgor, due to water loss\n\n(or water stress) the elastic inner walls regain their original shape, the guard\n\ncells become flaccid and the stoma closes.\n\nUsually the lower surface of a dorsiventral (often dicotyledonous) leaf\n\nhas a greater number of stomata while in\n\nan isobilateral (often monocotyledonous)\n\nleaf they are about equal on both surfaces.\n\nTranspiration is affected by several\n\nexternal factors: temperature, light,\n\nhumidity, wind speed. Plant factors that\n\naffect transpiration include number and\n\ndistribution of stomata, per cent of open\n\nstomata, water status of the plant, canopy\n\nstructure etc.\nFigure11.8  A stomatal aperture with guard cells\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n188 BIOLOGY\n\nThe transpiration driven ascent of xylem sap depends mainly on the\n\nfollowing physical properties of water:\n\n• Cohesion – mutual attraction between water molecules.\n\n• Adhesion – attraction of water molecules to polar surfaces (such\nas the surface of tracheary elements).\n\n• Surface Tension – water molecules are attracted to each other in\nthe liquid phase more than to water in the gas phase.\n\nThese properties give water high tensile strength, i.e., an ability to\n\nresist a pulling force, and high capillarity, i.e., the ability to rise in thin\n\ntubes. In plants capillarity is aided by the small diameter of the tracheary\n\nelements – the tracheids and vessel elements.\n\nThe process of photosynthesis requires water. The system of xylem\n\nvessels from the root to the leaf vein can supply the needed water.  But\n\nwhat force does a plant use to move water molecules into the leaf\n\nparenchyma cells where they are needed? As water evaporates through\n\nthe stomata, since the thin film of water over the cells is continuous, it\n\nresults in pulling of  water, molecule by molecule, into the leaf from the\n\nxylem. Also, because of lower concentration of water vapour in the\n\natmosphere as compared to the substomatal cavity and intercellular\n\nspaces, water diffuses into the surrounding air. This creates a ‘pull’\n\n(Figure 11.9).\n\nMeasurements reveal that the forces generated by transpiration can\n\ncreate pressures sufficient to lift a xylem sized column of water over 130\n\nmetres high.\n\nXylem\n\nPhloem\n\nDiffusion into\nsurrounding air\n\nStoma\nGuard Cell\n\nPalisade\n\nFigure11.9 Water movement in the leaf. Evaporation from the leaf sets up\na pressure gradient between the outside air and the air spaces of the\nleaf. The gradient is transmitted into the photosynthetic cells and on\nthe water-filled xylem in the leaf vein.\n\nStomatal\npore\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTRANSPORT IN PLANTS 189\n\n11.4.1 Transpiration and Photosynthesis – a Compromise\n\nTranspiration has more than one purpose; it\n\n• creates transpiration pull for absorption and transport of plants\n\n• supplies water for photosynthesis\n\n• transports minerals from the soil to all parts of the plant\n\n• cools leaf surfaces, sometimes 10 to 15 degrees, by evaporative\ncooling\n\n• maintains the shape and structure of the plants by keeping cells\nturgid\n\nAn actively photosynthesising plant has an insatiable need for water.\n\nPhotosynthesis is limited by available water which can be swiftly depleted\n\nby transpiration. The humidity of rainforests is largely due to this vast\n\ncycling of water from root to leaf to atmosphere and back to the soil.\n\nThe evolution of the C\n4 \nphotosynthetic system is probably one of the\n\nstrategies for maximising the availability of CO\n2\n while minimising water\n\nloss.  C\n4\n plants are twice as efficient as C\n\n3\n plants in terms of fixing carbon\n\ndioxide (making sugar). However, a C\n4\n plant loses only half as much water\n\nas a C\n3\n plant for the same amount of CO\n\n2\n fixed.\n\n11.5 UPTAKE AND TRANSPORT OF MINERAL NUTRIENTS\n\nPlants obtain their carbon and most of their oxygen from CO\n2\n in the\n\natmosphere. However, their remaining nutritional requirements are\n\nobtained from water and minerals in the soil.\n\n11.5.1 Uptake of Mineral Ions\n\nUnlike water, all minerals cannot be passively absorbed by the roots.\n\nTwo factors account for this: (i) minerals are present in the soil as charged\n\nparticles (ions) which cannot move across cell membranes and (ii) the\n\nconcentration of minerals in the soil is usually lower than the concentration\n\nof minerals in the root. Therefore, most minerals must enter the root by\n\nactive absorption into the cytoplasm of epidermal cells. This needs energy\n\nin the form of ATP. The active uptake of ions is partly responsible for the\n\nwater potential gradient in roots, and therefore for the uptake of water by\n\nosmosis. Some ions also move into the epidermal cells passively.\n\nIons are absorbed from the soil by both passive and active transport.\n\nSpecific proteins in the membranes of root hair cells actively pump ions\n\nfrom the soil into the cytoplasms of the epidermal cells. Like all cells, the\n\nendodermal cells have many transport proteins embedded in their plasma\n\nmembrane; they let some solutes cross the membrane, but not others.\n\nTransport proteins of endodermal cells are control points, where a plant\n\nadjusts the quantity and types of solutes that reach the xylem. Note\n\nthat the root endodermis because of the layer of suberin has the ability to\n\nactively transport ions in one direction only.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n190 BIOLOGY\n\n11.5.2 Translocation of Mineral Ions\n\nAfter the ions have reached xylem through active or passive uptake, or a\n\ncombination of the two, their further transport up the stem to all parts of\n\nthe plant is through the transpiration stream.\n\nThe chief sinks for the mineral elements are the growing regions of the\n\nplant, such as the apical and lateral meristems, young leaves, developing\n\nflowers, fruits and seeds, and the storage organs.  Unloading of mineral\n\nions occurs at the fine vein endings through diffusion and active uptake\n\nby these cells.\n\nMineral ions are frequently remobilised, particularly from older,\n\nsenescing parts.  Older dying leaves export much of their mineral content\n\nto younger leaves.  Similarly, before leaf fall in decidous plants, minerals\n\nare removed to other parts. Elements most readily mobilised are\n\nphosphorus, sulphur, nitrogen and potassium.  Some elements that are\n\nstructural components like calcium are not remobilised.\n\nAn analysis of the xylem exudates shows that though some of the\n\nnitrogen travels as inorganic ions, much of it is carried in the organic\n\nform as amino acids and related compounds. Similarly, small amounts\n\nof P and S are carried as organic compounds.  In addition, small amount\n\nof exchange of materials does take place between xylem and phloem.\n\nHence, it is not that we can clearly make a distinction and say categorically\n\nthat xylem transports only inorganic nutrients while phloem transports\n\nonly organic materials, as was traditionally believed.\n\n11.6   PHLOEM TRANSPORT: FLOW FROM SOURCE TO SINK\n\nFood, primarily sucrose, is transported by the vascular tissue phloem\n\nfrom a source to a sink. Usually the source is understood to be that\n\npart of the plant which synthesises the food, i.e., the leaf, and sink, the\n\npart that needs or stores the food.  But, the source and sink may be\n\nreversed depending on the season, or the plant’s needs. Sugar stored\n\nin roots may be mobilised to become a source of food in the early spring\n\nwhen the buds of trees, act as sink; they need energy for growth and\n\ndevelopment of the photosynthetic apparatus. Since the source-sink\n\nrelationship is variable, the direction of movement in the phloem can\n\nbe upwards or downwards, i.e., bi-directional. This contrasts with\n\nthat of the xylem where the movement is always unidirectional, i.e.,\n\nupwards. Hence, unlike one-way flow of water in transpiration, food\n\nin phloem sap can be transported in any required direction so long\n\nas there is a source of sugar and a sink able to use, store or remove\n\nthe sugar.\n\nPhloem sap is mainly water and sucrose, but other sugars, hormones\n\nand amino acids are also transported or translocated through phloem.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTRANSPORT IN PLANTS 191\n\n11.6.1 The Pressure Flow or Mass Flow Hypothesis\n\nThe accepted mechanism used for the translocation of sugars from source\n\nto sink is called the pressure flow hypothesis. (see Figure 11.10). As\n\nglucose is prepared at the source (by photosynthesis) it is converted to\n\nsucrose (a dissacharide). The sugar is then moved in the form of sucrose\n\ninto the companion cells and then into the living phloem sieve tube cells\n\nby active transport. This process of loading at the source produces a\n\nhypertonic condition in the phloem. Water in the adjacent xylem moves\n\ninto the phloem by osmosis. As osmotic pressure builds up the phloem\n\nsap will move to areas of lower pressure.  At the sink osmotic pressure\n\nmust be reduced. Again active transport is necessary to move the sucrose\n\nout of the phloem sap and into the cells which will use the sugar –\n\nconverting it into energy, starch, or cellulose. As sugars are removed, the\n\nosmotic pressure decreases and water moves out of the phloem.\n\nTo summarise, the movement of sugars in the phloem begins at the\n\nsource, where sugars are loaded (actively transported) into a sieve tube.\n\nLoading of the phloem sets up a water potential gradient that facilitates\n\nthe mass movement in the phloem.\n\nPhloem tissue is composed of sieve tube cells, which form long columns\n\nwith holes in their end walls called sieve plates. Cytoplasmic strands pass\n\nthrough the holes in the sieve plates, so forming continuous filaments. As\n\nhydrostatic pressure in the sieve tube of phloem increases, pressure flow\n\nbegins, and the sap moves through the phloem. Meanwhile, at the sink,\n\nincoming sugars are actively transported out of the phloem and removed\n\nSugars leave sieve tube\nfor metabolism and\n\nstorage; water follows\nby osmosis\n\n=High\n\nPhloem\n\nturgor\npressure\n\nRoot\n\nSugars enter sieve tubes;\nwater follows by osmosis\n\nSugar solution flows\nto regions of low\nturgor pressure\n\nTip of stem\n\nSugars leave sieve tubes;\nwater follows by osmosis\n\nFigure11.10 Diagrammatic presentation of mechanism of translocation\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n192 BIOLOGY\n\nas complex carbohydrates. The loss of solute produces a high water\n\npotential in the phloem, and water passes out, returning eventually to xylem.\n\nA simple experiment, called girdling, was used to identify the tissues\n\nthrough which food is transported. On the trunk of a tree a ring of bark\n\nup to a depth of the phloem layer, can be carefully removed.  In the absence\n\nof downward movement of food the portion of the bark  above the ring on\n\nthe stem becomes swollen after a few weeks.  This simple experiment\n\nshows that phloem is the tissue responsible for translocation of food; and\n\nthat transport takes place in one direction, i.e., towards the roots. This\n\nexperiment can be performed by you easily.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nPlants obtain a variety of inorganic elements (ions) and salts from their\n\nsurroundings especially from water and soil. The movement of these nutrients\n\nfrom environment into the plant as well as from one plant cell to another plant cell\n\nessentially involves movement across a cell membrane. Transport across cell\n\nmembrane can be through diffusion, facilitated transport or active transport. Water\n\nand minerals absorbed by roots are transported by xylem and the organic material\n\nsynthesised in the leaves is transported to other parts of plant through phloem.\n\nPassive transport (diffusion, osmosis) and active transport are the two modes\n\nof nutrient transport across cell membranes in living organisms. In passive\n\ntransport,  nutrients move across the membrane by diffusion, without any use of\n\nenergy as it is always down the concentration gradient and hence entropy driven.\n\nThis diffusion of substances depends on their size, solubility in water or organic\n\nsolvents. Osmosis is the special type of diffusion of water across a selectively\n\npermeable membrane which depends on pressure gradient and concentration\n\ngradient. In active transport, energy in the form of ATP is utilised to pump\n\nmolecules against a concentration gradient across membranes. Water potential is\n\nthe potential energy of water molecules which helps in the movement of water. It is\n\ndetermined by solute potential and pressure potential. The osmotic behaviour of\n\ncells depends on the surrounding solution. If the surrounding solution of the cell\n\nis hypertonic, it gets plasmolysed. The absorption of water by seeds and drywood\n\ntakes place by a special type of diffusion called imbibition.\n\nIn higher plants, there is a vascular system comprising of xylem and phloem,\n\nresponsible for translocation. Water minerals and food cannot be moved within\n\nthe body of a plant by diffusion alone. They are therefore, transported by a mass\n\nflow system – movement of substance in bulk from one point to another as a\n\nresult of pressure differences between the two points.\n\nWater absorbed by root hairs moves into the root tissue by two distinct\n\npathways, i.e., apoplast and symplast. Various ions, and water from soil can be\n\ntransported upto a small height in stems by root pressure. Transpiration pull\n\nmodel is the most acceptable to explain the transport of water.

The translocation in phloem is bi-directional; the source-sink\n\nrelationship is variable. The translocation in phloem is explained by the pressure-\n\nflow hypothesis.\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1.
