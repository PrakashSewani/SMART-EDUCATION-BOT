The living world\n\ncomprises an amazing diversity of living organisms. Early man could\n\neasily perceive the difference between inanimate matter and living\n\norganisms. Early man deified some of the inanimate matter (wind, sea,\n\nfire etc.) and some among the animals and plants. A common feature of\n\nall such forms of inanimate and animate objects was the sense of awe\n\nor fear that they evoked. The description of living organisms including\n\nhuman beings began much later in human history. Societies which\n\nindulged in anthropocentric view of biology could register limited\n\nprogress in biological knowledge. Systematic and monumental\n\ndescription of life forms brought in, out of necessity, detailed systems\n\nof identification, nomenclature and classification. The biggest spin off\n\nof such studies was the recognition of the sharing of similarities among\n\nliving organisms both horizontally and vertically. That all present day\n\nliving organisms are related to each other and also to all organisms\n\nthat ever lived on this earth, was a revelation which humbled man and\n\nled to cultural movements for conservation of biodiversity. In the\n\nfollowing chapters of this unit, you will get a description, including\n\nclassification, of animals and plants from a taxonomist’s perspective.\n\nDIVERSITY IN THE LIVING WORLD\n\nChapter 1\n\nThe Living World\n\nChapter 2\n\nBiological Classification\n\nChapter 3\n\nPlant Kingdom\n\nChapter 4\n\nAnimal Kingdom\n\nUNIT 1\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nBorn on 5 July 1904, in Kempten, Germany, ERNST MAYR, the\nHarvard University evolutionary biologist who has been called\n‘The Darwin of the 20th century’, was one of the 100 greatest\nscientists of all time. Mayr joined Harvard’s Faculty of Arts\nand Sciences in 1953 and retired in 1975, assuming the title\nAlexander Agassiz Professor of Zoology Emeritus. Throughout\nhis nearly 80-year career, his research spanned ornithology,\ntaxonomy, zoogeography, evolution, systematics, and the\nhistory and philosophy of biology. He almost single-handedly\nmade the origin of species diversity the central question of\nevolutionary biology that it is today. He also pioneered the\ncurrently accepted definition of a biological species. Mayr was\nawarded the three prizes widely regarded as the triple crown of\nbiology: the Balzan Prize in 1983, the International Prize for\nBiology in 1994, and the Crafoord Prize in 1999. Mayr died at\nthe age of 100 in the year 2004.\n\nErnst Mayr\n(1904 – 2004)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nHow wonderful is the living world ! The wide range of living types is\n\namazing. The extraordinary habitats in which we find living organisms,\n\nbe it cold mountains, deciduous forests, oceans, fresh water lakes, deserts\n\nor hot springs, leave us speechless. The beauty of a galloping horse, of\n\nthe migrating birds, the valley of flowers or the attacking shark evokes\n\nawe and a deep sense of wonder. The ecological conflict and cooperation\n\namong members of a population and among populations of a community\n\nor even the molecular traffic inside a cell make us deeply reflect on – what\n\nindeed is life? This question has two implicit questions within it. The first\n\nis a technical one and seeks answer to what living is as opposed to the\n\nnon-living, and the second is a philosophical one, and seeks answer to\n\nwhat the purpose of life is. As scientists, we shall not attempt answering\n\nthe second question. We will try to reflect on – what is living?\n\n1.1 WHAT IS ‘LIVING’?\n\nWhen we try to define ‘living’, we conventionally look for distinctive\n\ncharacteristics exhibited by living organisms. Growth, reproduction, ability\n\nto sense environment and mount a suitable response come to our mind\n\nimmediately as unique features of living organisms. One can add a few\n\nmore features like metabolism, ability to self-replicate, self-organise,\n\ninteract and emergence to this list. Let us try to understand each of these.\n\nAll living organisms grow. Increase in mass and increase in number\n\nof individuals are twin characteristics of growth. A multicellular organism\n\nTHE LIVING WORLD\n\nCHAPTER  1\n\n1.1 What is ‘Living’?\n\n1.2 Diversity in the\n\nLiving World\n\n1.3 Taxonomic\n\nCategories\n\n1.4 Taxonomical\n\nAids\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n4 BIOLOGY\n\ngrows by cell division. In plants, this growth by cell division occurs\n\ncontinuously throughout their life span. In animals, this growth is seen\n\nonly up to a certain age. However, cell division occurs in certain tissues to\n\nreplace lost cells. Unicellular organisms grow by cell division. One can\n\neasily observe this in in vitro cultures by simply counting the number of\n\ncells under the microscope. In majority of higher animals and plants,\n\ngrowth and reproduction are mutually exclusive events. One must\n\nremember that increase in body mass is considered as growth. Non-living\n\nobjects also grow if we take increase in body mass as a criterion for growth.\n\nMountains, boulders and sand mounds do grow. However, this kind of\n\ngrowth exhibited by non-living objects is by accumulation of material on\n\nthe surface. In living organisms, growth is from inside. Growth, therefore,\n\ncannot be taken as a defining property of living organisms. Conditions\n\nunder which it can be observed in all living organisms have to be explained\n\nand then we understand that it is a characteristic of living systems. A\n\ndead organism does not grow.\n\nReproduction, likewise, is a characteristic of living organisms.\n\nIn multicellular organisms, reproduction refers to the production of\n\nprogeny possessing features more or less similar to those of parents.\n\nInvariably and implicitly we refer to sexual reproduction. Organisms\n\nreproduce by asexual means also. Fungi multiply and spread easily due\n\nto the millions of asexual spores they produce. In lower organisms like\n\nyeast and hydra, we observe budding. In Planaria (flat worms), we observe\n\ntrue regeneration, i.e., a fragmented organism regenerates the lost part of\n\nits body and becomes, a new organism. The fungi, the filamentous algae,\n\nthe protonema of mosses, all easily multiply by fragmentation. When it\n\ncomes to unicellular organisms like bacteria, unicellular algae or Amoeba,\n\nreproduction is synonymous with growth, i.e., increase in number of cells.\n\nWe have already defined growth as equivalent to increase in cell number\n\nor mass. Hence, we notice that in single-celled organisms, we are not very\n\nclear about the usage of these two terms – growth and reproduction.\n\nFurther, there are many organisms which do not reproduce (mules, sterile\n\nworker bees, infertile human couples, etc). Hence, reproduction also cannot\n\nbe an all-inclusive defining characteristic of living organisms. Of course,\n\nno non-living object is capable of reproducing or replicating by itself.\n\nAnother characteristic of life is metabolism. All living organisms\n\nare made of chemicals. These chemicals, small and big, belonging to\n\nvarious classes, sizes, functions, etc., are constantly being made and\n\nchanged into some other biomolecules. These conversions are chemical\n\nreactions or metabolic reactions. There are thousands of metabolic\n\nreactions occurring simultaneously inside all living organisms, be they\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTHE LIVING WORLD 5\n\nunicellular or multicellular. All plants, animals, fungi and microbes exhibit\n\nmetabolism. The sum total of all the chemical reactions occurring in our\n\nbody is metabolism. No non-living object exhibits metabolism. Metabolic\n\nreactions can be demonstrated outside the body in cell-free systems. An\n\nisolated metabolic reaction(s) outside the body of an organism, performed\n\nin a test tube is neither living nor non-living. Hence, while metabolism is\n\na defining feature of all living organisms without exception, isolated\n\nmetabolic reactions in vitro are not living things but surely living reactions.\n\nHence, cellular organisation of the body is the defining feature of\n\nlife forms.\n\nPerhaps, the most obvious and technically complicated feature of all\n\nliving organisms is this ability to sense their surroundings or environment\n\nand respond to these environmental stimuli which could be physical,\n\nchemical or biological. We sense our environment through our sense\n\norgans. Plants respond to external factors like light, water,  temperature,\n\nother organisms, pollutants, etc. All organisms, from the prokaryotes to\n\nthe most complex eukaryotes can sense and respond to environmental\n\ncues. Photoperiod affects reproduction in seasonal breeders, both plants\n\nand animals. All organisms handle chemicals entering their bodies. All\n\norganisms therefore, are ‘aware’ of their surroundings. Human being is\n\nthe only organism who is aware of himself, i.e., has self-consciousness.\n\nConsciousness therefore, becomes the defining property of living\n\norganisms.\n\nWhen it comes to human beings, it is all the more difficult to define\n\nthe living state. We observe patients lying in coma in hospitals virtually\n\nsupported by machines which replace heart and lungs. The patient is\n\notherwise brain-dead. The patient has no self-consciousness. Are such\n\npatients who never come back to normal life, living or non-living?\n\nIn higher classes, you will come to know that all living phenomena\n\nare due to underlying interactions. Properties of tissues are not present\n\nin the constituent cells but arise as a result of interactions among the\n\nconstituent cells. Similarly, properties of cellular organelles are not present\n\nin the molecular constituents of the organelle but arise as a result of\n\ninteractions among the molecular components comprising the organelle.\n\nThese interactions result in emergent properties at a higher level of\n\norganisation. This phenomenon is true in the hierarchy of organisational\n\ncomplexity at all levels. Therefore, we can say that living organisms are\n\nself-replicating, evolving and self-regulating interactive systems capable\n\nof responding to external stimuli. Biology is the story of life on earth.\n\nBiology is the story of evolution of living organisms on earth. All living\n\norganisms – present, past and future, are linked to one another by the\n\nsharing of the common genetic material, but to varying degrees.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n6 BIOLOGY\n\n1.2 DIVERSITY IN THE LIVING WORLD\n\nIf you look around you will see a large variety of living organisms, be it\n\npotted plants, insects, birds, your pets or other animals and plants. There\n\nare also several organisms that you cannot see with your naked eye but\n\nthey are all around you. If you were to increase the area that you make\n\nobservations in, the range and variety of organisms that you see would\n\nincrease. Obviously, if you were to visit a dense forest, you would probably\n\nsee a much greater number and kinds of living organisms in it. Each\n\ndifferent kind of plant, animal or organism that you see, represents a\n\nspecies. The number of species that are known and described range\n\nbetween 1.7-1.8 million. This refers to biodiversity or the number and\n\ntypes of organisms present on earth. We should remember here that as\n\nwe explore new areas, and even old ones, new organisms are continuously\n\nbeing identified.\n\nAs stated earlier, there are millions of plants and animals in the world;\n\nwe know the plants and animals in our own area by their local names.\n\nThese local names would vary from place to place, even within a country.\n\nProbably you would recognise the confusion that would be created if we\n\ndid not find ways and means to talk to each other, to refer to organisms\n\nwe are talking about.\n\nHence, there is a need to standardise the naming of living organisms\n\nsuch that a particular organism is known by the same name all over the\n\nworld. This process is called nomenclature. Obviously, nomenclature or\n\nnaming is only possible when the organism is described correctly and we\n\nknow to what organism the name is attached to. This is identification.\n\nIn order to facilitate the study, number of scientists have established\n\nprocedures to assign a scientific name to each known organism.  This is\n\nacceptable to biologists all over the world. For plants, scientific names are\n\nbased on agreed principles and criteria, which are provided in International\n\nCode for Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN). You may ask, how  are animals\n\nnamed? Animal taxonomists have evolved International Code of Zoological\n\nNomenclature (ICZN). The scientific names ensure that each organism\n\nhas only one name. Description of any organism should enable the people\n\n(in any part of the world) to arrive at the same name. They also ensure\n\nthat such a name has not been used for any other known organism.\n\nBiologists follow universally accepted principles to provide scientific\n\nnames to known organisms.  Each name has two components – the\n\nGeneric name and the specific epithet. This system of providing a name\n\nwith two components is called Binomial nomenclature. This naming\n\nsystem given by Carolus Linnaeus is being practised by biologists all\n\nover the world. This naming system using a two word format was found\n\nconvenient. Let us take the example of mango to understand the way of\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTHE LIVING WORLD 7\n\nproviding scientific names better. The scientific name of mango is written\n\nas Mangifera indica. Let us see how it is a binomial name.  In this name\n\nMangifera represents the genus while indica, is a particular species, or a\n\nspecific epithet. Other universal rules of nomenclature are as follows:\n\n1. Biological names are generally in Latin and written in italics.\n\nThey are Latinised or derived from Latin irrespective of their\n\norigin.\n\n2. The first word in a biological name represents the genus while\n\nthe second component denotes the specific epithet.\n\n3. Both the words in a biological name, when handwritten, are\n\nseparately underlined, or printed in italics to indicate their Latin\n\norigin.\n\n4. The first word denoting the genus starts with a capital letter\n\nwhile the specific epithet starts with a small letter. It can be\n\nillustrated with the example of Mangifera indica.\n\nName of the author appears after the specific epithet, i.e., at the end of\n\nthe biological name and is written in an abbreviated form, e.g., Mangifera\n\nindica Linn. It indicates that this species was first described by Linnaeus.\n\nSince it is nearly impossible to study all the living organisms, it is\n\nnecessary to devise some means to make this possible. This process is\n\nclassification. Classification is the process by which anything is grouped\n\ninto convenient categories based on some easily observable characters.\n\nFor example, we easily recognise groups such as plants or animals or\n\ndogs, cats or insects. The moment we use any of these terms, we associate\n\ncertain characters with the organism in that group. What image do you\n\nsee when you think of a dog ? Obviously, each one of us will see ‘dogs’\n\nand not ‘cats’. Now, if we were to think of ‘Alsatians’ we know what we are\n\ntalking about. Similarly, suppose we were to say ‘mammals’, you would,\n\nof course, think of animals with external ears and body hair. Likewise, in\n\nplants, if we try to talk of ‘Wheat’, the picture in each of our minds will be\n\nof wheat plants, not of rice or any other plant. Hence, all these - ‘Dogs’,\n\n‘Cats’, ‘Mammals’, ‘Wheat’, ‘Rice’, ‘Plants’, ‘Animals’, etc., are convenient\n\ncategories we use to study organisms. The scientific term for these\n\ncategories is taxa. Here you must recognise that taxa can indicate\n\ncategories at very different levels. ‘Plants’ – also form a taxa. ‘Wheat’ is\n\nalso a taxa. Similarly, ‘animals’, ‘mammals’, ‘dogs’ are all taxa – but you\n\nknow that a dog is a mammal and mammals are animals. Therefore,\n\n‘animals’, ‘mammals’ and ‘dogs’ represent taxa at different levels.\n\nHence, based on characteristics, all living organisms can be classified\n\ninto different taxa. This process of classification is taxonomy. External\n\nand internal structure, along with the structure of cell, development\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n8 BIOLOGY\n\nprocess and ecological information of organisms are essential and form\n\nthe basis of modern taxonomic studies.\n\nHence, characterisation, identification, classification and nomenclature\n\nare the processes that are basic to taxonomy.\n\nTaxonomy is not something new. Human beings have always been\n\ninterested in knowing more and more about the various kinds of\n\norganisms, particularly with reference to their own use. In early days,\n\nhuman beings needed to find sources for their basic needs of food, clothing\n\nand shelter. Hence, the earliest classifications were based on the ‘uses’ of\n\nvarious organisms.\n\nHuman beings were, since long, not only interested in knowing more\n\nabout different kinds of organisms and their diversities, but also the\n\nrelationships among them.  This branch of study was referred to as\n\nsystematics.  The word systematics is derived from the Latin word\n\n‘systema’ which means systematic arrangement of organisms.  Linnaeus\n\nused Systema Naturae as the  title of his publication.  The scope of\n\nsystematics was later enlarged to include identification, nomenclature\n\nand classification. Systematics takes into account evolutionary\n\nrelationships between organisms.\n\n1.3 TAXONOMIC CATEGORIES\n\nClassification is not a single step process but involves hierarchy of steps\n\nin which each step represents a rank or category.  Since the category is a\n\npart of overall taxonomic arrangement, it is called the taxonomic category\n\nand all categories together constitute the taxonomic hierarchy.  Each\n\ncategory, referred to as a unit of classification, in fact, represents a rank\n\nand is commonly termed as taxon (pl.: taxa).\n\nTaxonomic categories and hierarchy can be illustrated by an example.\n\nInsects represent a group of organisms sharing common features like\n\nthree pairs of jointed legs.  It means insects are recognisable concrete\n\nobjects which can be classified, and thus were given a rank or category.\n\nCan you name other such groups of organisms? Remember, groups\n\nrepresent category.  Category further denotes rank.  Each rank or taxon,\n\nin fact, represents a unit of classification. These taxonomic groups/\n\ncategories are distinct biological entities and not merely morphological\n\naggregates.\n\nTaxonomical studies of all known organisms have led to the\n\ndevelopment of common categories such as kingdom, phylum or division\n\n(for plants), class, order, family, genus and species. All organisms,\n\nincluding those in the plant and animal kingdoms have species as the\n\nlowest category. Now the question you may ask is, how to place an\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTHE LIVING WORLD 9\n\norganism in various categories? The basic requirement is the knowledge\n\nof characters of an individual or group of organisms.  This helps in\n\nidentifying similarities and dissimilarities among the individuals of the\n\nsame kind of organisms as well as of other kinds of organisms.\n\n1.3.1 Species\n\nTaxonomic studies consider a group of individual organisms with\n\nfundamental similarities as a species.  One should be able to distinguish\n\none species from the other closely related species based on the distinct\n\nmorphological differences. Let us consider Mangifera indica, Solanum\n\ntuberosum (potato) and Panthera leo (lion). All the three names, indica,\n\ntuberosum and leo, represent the specific epithets,  while the first words\n\nMangifera, Solanum and Panthera are genera and represents another\n\nhigher level of taxon or category. Each genus may have one or more than\n\none specific epithets representing different organisms, but having\n\nmorphological similarities.  For example,  Panthera has another specific\n\nepithet called tigris and Solanum includes species like nigrum and\n\nmelongena. Human beings belong to the species sapiens  which is\n\ngrouped in the genus Homo. The scientific name thus, for human being,\n\nis written as Homo sapiens.\n\n1.3.2 Genus\n\nGenus comprises a group of related species which has more characters\n\nin common in comparison to species of other genera. We can say that\n\ngenera are aggregates of closely related species. For example, potato and\n\nbrinjal are two different species but both belong to the genus Solanum.\n\nLion (Panthera leo), leopard (P. pardus) and tiger (P. tigris) with several\n\ncommon features, are all species of the genus Panthera. This genus differs\n\nfrom another genus Felis which includes cats.\n\n1.3.3 Family\n\nThe next category, Family, has a group of related genera with still less\n\nnumber of similarities as compared to genus and species.   Families are\n\ncharacterised on the basis of both vegetative and reproductive features of\n\nplant species. Among plants for example, three different genera Solanum,\n\nPetunia and Datura are placed in the family Solanaceae. Among animals\n\nfor example, genus Panthera, comprising lion, tiger, leopard is put along\n\nwith genus, Felis (cats) in the family Felidae. Similarly, if you observe the\n\nfeatures of a cat and a dog, you will find some similarities and  some\n\ndifferences as well. They are separated into two different families – Felidae\n\nand Canidae, respectively.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n10 BIOLOGY\n\n1.3.4 Order\n\nYou have seen earlier that categories like species, genus and\n\nfamilies are based on a number of similar characters.   Generally,\n\norder and other higher taxonomic categories are identified based\n\non the aggregates of characters.  Order being a higher category,\n\nis the assemblage of families which exhibit a few similar\n\ncharacters.  The similar characters are less in number as\n\ncompared to different genera included in a family.  Plant families\n\nlike Convolvulaceae, Solanaceae are included in the order\n\nPolymoniales mainly based on the floral characters. The animal\n\norder, Carnivora, includes families like Felidae and Canidae.\n\n1.3.5 Class\n\nThis category includes related orders. For example, order Primata\n\ncomprising monkey, gorilla and gibbon is placed in class\n\nMammalia along with order Carnivora that includes animals like\n\ntiger, cat and dog. Class Mammalia has other orders also.\n\n1.3.6 Phylum\n\nClasses comprising animals like fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds\n\nalong with mammals constitute the next higher category called\n\nPhylum. All these, based on the common features like presence\n\nof notochord and dorsal hollow neural system, are included in\n\nphylum Chordata.  In case of plants,  classes with a few similar\n\ncharacters are assigned to a higher category called Division.\n\n1.3.7 Kingdom\n\nAll animals belonging to various phyla are assigned to the\n\nhighest category called Kingdom Animalia in the classification\n\nsystem of animals. The Kingdom Plantae, on the other hand, is\n\ndistinct, and comprises all plants from various divisions.\n\nHenceforth, we will refer to these two groups as animal and\n\nplant kingdoms.\n\nThe taxonomic categories from species to kingdom have been\n\nshown in ascending order starting with species in Figure 1.1.\n\nThese are broad categories.  However, taxonomists have also\n\ndeveloped sub-categories in this hierarchy to facilitate more\n\nsound and scientific placement of various taxa.\n\nLook at the hierarchy in Figure 1.1. Can you recall the basis\n\nof arrangement? Say, for example, as we go higher from species\n\nto kingdom, the number of common characteristics goes on\n\nFigure 1.1 Taxonomic\nc a t e g o r i e s\ns h o w i n g\nhierarchial\narrangement\nin ascending\norder\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTHE LIVING WORLD 11\n\n1.4 TAXONOMICAL AIDS\n\nTaxonomic studies of various species of plants, animals and other\n\norganisms are useful in agriculture, forestry, industry and in general in\n\nknowing our bio-resources and their diversity. These studies would\n\nrequire correct classification and identification of organisms. Identification\n\nof organisms requires intensive laboratory and field studies. The collection\n\nof actual specimens of plant and animal species is essential and is the\n\nprime source of taxonomic studies. These are also fundamental to studies\n\nand essential for training in systematics. It is used for classification of an\n\norganism, and the information gathered is also stored along with the\n\nspecimens. In some cases the specimen is preserved for future studies.\n\nBiologists have established certain procedures and techniques to store\n\nand preserve the information as well as the specimens.  Some of these are\n\nexplained to help you understand the usage of these aids.\n\n1.4.1 Herbarium\n\nHerbarium is a store house of collected plant specimens that are dried,\n\npressed and preserved on sheets. Further, these sheets are arranged\n\ndecreasing. Lower the taxa, more are the characteristics that the members\n\nwithin the taxon share. Higher the category, greater is the difficulty of\n\ndetermining the relationship to other taxa at the same level. Hence, the\n\nproblem of classification becomes more complex.\n\nTable 1.1 indicates the taxonomic categories to which some common\n\norganisms like housefly, man, mango and wheat belong.\n\nCommon Biological Genus Family Order Class Phylum/\nName  Name Division\n\nMan Homo sapiens Homo Hominidae Primata Mammalia Chordata\n\nHousefly Musca Musca Muscidae Diptera Insecta Arthropoda\ndomestica\n\nMango Mangifera Mangifera Anacardiaceae Sapindales Dicotyledonae Angiospermae\nindica\n\nWheat Triticum Triticum Poaceae Poales Monocotyledonae Angiospermae\naestivum\n\nTABLE 1.1  Organisms with their Taxonomic Categories\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n12 BIOLOGY\n\naccording to a universally accepted system of classification. These\n\nspecimens, along with their descriptions on herbarium sheets, become a\n\nstore house or repository for future use (Figure 1.2). The herbarium sheets\n\nalso carry a label providing information about date and place of collection,\n\nEnglish, local and botanical names, family, collector’s name, etc. Herbaria\n\nalso serve as quick referral systems in taxonomical studies.\n\n1.4.2 Botanical Gardens\n\nThese specialised gardens have collections of living plants for reference.\n\nPlant species in these gardens are grown for identification purposes and\n\neach plant is labelled indicating its botanical/scientific name and its family.\n\nThe famous botanical gardens are at Kew (England), Indian Botanical\n\nGarden, Howrah (India) and at National Botanical Research Institute,\n\nLucknow (India).\n\n1.4.3 Museum\n\nBiological museums are generally set up in educational institutes such\n\nas schools and colleges. Museums have collections of  preserved plant\n\nand animal specimens for study and reference.  Specimens are preserved\n\nin the containers or jars in preservative solutions. Plant and animal\n\nspecimens may also be preserved as dry specimens. Insects are preserved\n\nin insect boxes after collecting, killing and pinning. Larger animals like\n\nbirds and mammals are usually stuffed and preserved. Museums often\n\nhave collections of skeletons of animals too.\n\nFigure 1.2  Herbarium showing stored specimens\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTHE LIVING WORLD 13\n\n1.4.4 Zoological Parks\n\nThese are the places where wild animals are kept in protected environments\n\nunder human care and which enable us to learn about their food habits\n\nand behaviour. All animals in a zoo are provided, as far as possible, the\n\nconditions similar to their natural habitats. Children love visiting these\n\nparks, commonly called Zoos (Figure 1.3).\n\nFigure 1.3  Pictures showing animals in different zoological parks of India\n\n1.4.5 Key\n\nKey is another taxonomical aid used for identification of plants and animals\n\nbased on the similarities and dissimilarities. The keys are based on the\n\ncontrasting characters generally in a pair called couplet.  It represents\n\nthe choice made between two opposite options. This results in acceptance\n\nof only one and rejection of the other. Each statement in the key is called\n\na lead.  Separate taxonomic keys are required for each taxonomic category\n\nsuch as family, genus and species for identification purposes. Keys are\n\ngenerally analytical in nature.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n14 BIOLOGY\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe living world is rich in variety. Millions of plants and animals have been\n\nidentified and described but a large number still remains unknown. The very\n\nrange of organisms in terms of size, colour, habitat, physiological and\n\nmorphological features make us seek the defining characteristics of living\n\norganisms. In order to facilitate the study of kinds and diversity of organisms,\n\nbiologists have evolved certain rules and principles for identification, nomenclature\n\nand classification of organisms. The branch of knowledge dealing with these aspects\n\nis referred to as taxonomy. The taxonomic studies of various species of plants\n\nand animals are useful in agriculture, forestry, industry and in general for knowing\n\nour bio-resources and their diversity. The basics of taxonomy like identification,\n\nnaming and classification of organisms are universally evolved under international\n\ncodes. Based on the resemblances and distinct differences, each organism is\n\nidentified and assigned a correct scientific/biological name comprising two words\n\nas per the binomial system of nomenclature. An organism represents/occupies a\n\nplace or position in the system of classification. There are many categories/ranks\n\nand are generally referred to as taxonomic categories or taxa. All the categories\n\nconstitute a taxonomic hierarchy.\n\nTaxonomists have developed a variety of taxonomic aids to facilitate\n\nidentification, naming and classification of organisms.  These studies are carried\n\nout from the actual specimens which are collected from the field and preserved as\n\nreferrals in the form of herbaria, museums and in botanical gardens and zoological\n\nparks. It requires special techniques for collection and preservation of specimens\n\nin herbaria and museums. Live specimens, on the other hand, of plants and\n\nanimals, are found in botanical gardens or in zoological parks. Taxonomists also\n\nprepare and disseminate information through manuals and monographs for\n\nfurther taxonomic studies. Taxonomic keys are tools that help in identification\n\nbased on characteristics.\n\nFlora, manuals, monographs and catalogues are some other means\n\nof recording descriptions. They also help in correct identification. Flora\n\ncontains the actual account of habitat and distribution of plants of a\n\ngiven area. These provide the index to the plant species found in a\n\nparticular area. Manuals are useful in providing information for\n\nidentification of names of species found in an area. Monographs contain\n\ninformation on any one taxon.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTHE LIVING WORLD 15\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1. Why are living organisms classified?\n\n2.
