Animals and\n\nplants exhibit a wide range of movements. Streaming of protoplasm in\n\nthe unicellular organisms like Amoeba is a simple form of movement.\n\nMovement of cilia, flagella and tentacles are shown by many organisms.\n\nHuman beings can move limbs, jaws, eyelids, tongue, etc. Some of the\n\nmovements result in a change of place or location. Such voluntary\n\nmovements are called locomotion. Walking, running, climbing, flying,\n\nswimming are all some forms of locomotory movements. Locomotory\n\nstructures need not be different from those affecting other types of\n\nmovements. For example, in Paramoecium, cilia helps in the movement of\n\nfood through cytopharynx and in locomotion as well. Hydra can use its\n\ntentacles for capturing its prey and also use them for locomotion. We use\n\nlimbs for changes in body postures and locomotion as well. The above\n\nobservations suggest that movements and locomotion cannot be studied\n\nseparately. The two may be linked by stating that all locomotions are\n\nmovements but all movements are not locomotions.\n\nMethods of locomotion performed by animals vary with their habitats\n\nand the demand of the situation. However, locomotion is generally for\n\nsearch of food, shelter, mate, suitable breeding grounds, favourable\n\nclimatic conditions or to escape from enemies/predators.\n\n20.1 TYPES OF MOVEMENT\n\nCells of the human body exhibit three main types of movements, namely,\namoeboid, ciliary and muscular.\n\nLOCOMOTION AND MOVEMENT\n\nCHAPTER  20\n\n20.1 Types of\n\nMovement\n\n20.2 Muscle\n\n20.3 Skeletal System\n\n20.4 Joints\n\n20.5 Disorders of\n\nMuscular and\n\nSkeletal System\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nLOCOMOTION AND MOVEMENT 303\n\nSome specialised cells in our body like macrophages and leucocytes\n\nin blood exhibit amoeboid movement. It is effected by pseudopodia formed\n\nby the streaming of protoplasm (as in Amoeba). Cytoskeletal elements\n\nlike microfilaments are also involved in amoeboid movement.\n\nCiliary movement occurs in most of our internal tubular organs which\n\nare lined by  ciliated epithelium. The coordinated movements of cilia in\n\nthe trachea help us in removing dust particles and some of the foreign\n\nsubstances inhaled alongwith the atmospheric air. Passage of ova through\n\nthe female reproductive tract is also facilitated by the ciliary movement.\n\nMovement of our limbs, jaws, tongue, etc, require muscular movement.\n\nThe contractile property of muscles are effectively used for locomotion\n\nand other movements by human beings and majority of multicellular\n\norganisms. Locomotion requires a perfect coordinated activity of muscular,\n\nskeletal and neural systems. In this chapter, you will learn about the\n\ntypes of muscles, their structure, mechanism of their contraction and\n\nimportant aspects of the skeletal system.\n\n20.2 MUSCLE\n\nYou have studied in Chapter 8 that the cilia and flagella are the outgrowths\n\nof the cell membrane. Flagellar movement helps in the swimming of\n\nspermatozoa, maintenance of water current in the canal system of sponges\n\nand in locomotion of Protozoans like Euglena. Muscle is a specialised\n\ntissue of mesodermal origin. About 40-50 per cent of the body\n\nweight of a human adult is contributed by muscles. They have\n\nspecial properties like excitability, contractility, extensibility and\n\nelasticity. Muscles have been classified using different criteria,\n\nnamely location, appearance and nature of regulation of their\n\nactivities. Based on their location, three types of muscles are\n\nidentified : (i) Skeletal (ii) Visceral and (iii) Cardiac.\n\nSkeletal muscles are closely associated with the skeletal components\n\nof the body. They have a striped appearance under the microscope and\n\nhence are called striated muscles. As their activities are under the\n\nvoluntary control of the nervous system, they are known as voluntary\n\nmuscles too. They are primarily involved in locomotory actions and\n\nchanges of body postures.\n\nVisceral muscles are located in the inner walls of hollow visceral organs\n\nof the body like the alimentary canal, reproductive tract, etc. They do not\n\nexhibit any striation and are smooth in appearance. Hence, they are called\n\nsmooth muscles (nonstriated muscle). Their activities are not under the\n\nvoluntary control of the nervous system and are therefore known as\n\ninvoluntary muscles. They assist, for example, in the transportation of food\n\nthrough the digestive tract and gametes through the genital tract.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n304 BIOLOGY\n\nmuscle fibre is lined by the plasma membrane called sarcolemma\n\nenclosing the sarcoplasm. Muscle fibre is a syncitium as the sarcoplasm\n\ncontains many nuclei. The endoplasmic reticulum, i.e., sarcoplasmic\n\nreticulum of the muscle fibres is the store house of calcium ions. A\n\ncharacteristic feature of the muscle fibre is the presence of a large number\n\nof parallelly arranged filaments in the sarcoplasm called myofilaments or\n\nmyofibrils. Each myofibril has alternate dark and light bands on it. A\n\ndetailed study of the myofibril has established that the striated appearance\n\nis due to the distribution pattern of two important proteins – Actin and\n\nMyosin. The light bands contain actin and is called I-band or Isotropic\n\nband, whereas the dark band called ‘A’ or Anisotropic band contains\n\nAs the name suggests, Cardiac muscles are the muscles of heart.\n\nMany cardiac muscle cells assemble in a branching pattern to form a\n\ncardiac muscle. Based on appearance, cardiac muscles are striated. They\n\nare involuntary in nature as the nervous system does not control their\n\nactivities directly.\n\nLet us examine a skeletal muscle in detail to understand the structure\n\nand mechanism of contraction. Each organised skeletal muscle in our\n\nbody is made of a number of muscle bundles or fascicles held together\n\nby a common collagenous connective tissue layer called fascia. Each\n\nmuscle bundle  contains a number of muscle fibres (Figure 20.1). Each\n\nFascicle\n(muscle bundle)\n\nMuscle fibre\n(muscle cell)\n\nSarcolemma\n\nBlood capillary\n\nFigure 20.1 Diagrammatic cross sectional view of a muscle showing muscle bundles\nand muscle fibres\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nLOCOMOTION AND MOVEMENT 305\n\nmyosin. Both the proteins are arranged as rod-like structures, parallel to\n\neach other and also to the longitudinal axis of the myofibrils. Actin\n\nfilaments are thinner as compared to the myosin filaments, hence are\n\ncommonly called thin and thick filaments respectively. In the centre of\n\neach ‘I’ band is an elastic fibre called ‘Z’ line which bisects it. The thin\n\nfilaments are firmly attached to the ‘Z’ line. The thick filaments in the\n\n‘A’ band are also held together in the middle of this band by a thin fibrous\n\nmembrane called ‘M’ line. The ‘A’ and ‘I’ bands are arranged alternately\n\nthroughout the length of the myofibrils. The portion of the myofibril\n\nbetween two successive ‘Z’ lines is considered as the functional unit of\n\ncontraction and is called a sarcomere (Figure 20.2). In a resting state, the\n\nedges of thin filaments on either side of the thick filaments partially overlap\n\nthe free ends of the thick filaments leaving the central part of the thick\n\nfilaments. This central part of thick filament, not overlapped by thin\n\nfilaments is called the ‘H’ zone.\n\nFigure 20.2 Diagrammatic representation of (a) anatomy of a muscle fibre showing\na sarcomere (b) a sarcomere\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n306 BIOLOGY\n\n20.2.1 Structure of Contractile Proteins\n\nEach actin (thin) filament is made of two ‘F’ (filamentous) actins\n\nhelically wound to each other. Each ‘F’ actin is a polymer of monomeric\n\n‘G’ (Globular) actins. Two filaments of another protein, tropomyosin\n\nalso run close to the ‘F’ actins throughout its length. A complex protein\n\nTroponin is distributed at regular intervals on the tropomyosin. In the\n\nresting state a subunit of troponin masks the active binding sites for\n\nmyosin on the actin filaments (Figure 20.3a).\n\nEach myosin (thick) filament is also a polymerised protein. Many\n\nmonomeric proteins called Meromyosins (Figure 20.3b) constitute one\n\nthick filament. Each meromyosin has two important parts, a globular\n\nhead with a short arm and a tail, the former being called the heavy\n\nmeromyosin (HMM) and the latter, the light meromyosin (LMM). The HMM\n\ncomponent, i.e.; the head and short arm projects outwards at regular\n\ndistance and angle from each other from the surface of a polymerised myosin\n\nfilament and is known as cross arm. The globular head is an active ATPase\n\nenzyme and has binding sites for ATP and active sites for actin.\n\nFigure 20.3 (a) An actin (thin) filament (b) Myosin monomer (Meromyosin)\n\nActin binding sites\n\nATP binding sites\nHead\n\nCross arm\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n20.2.2 Mechanism of Muscle Contraction\n\nMechanism of muscle contraction is best explained by the sliding filament\n\ntheory which states that contraction of a muscle fibre takes place by the\n\nsliding of the thin filaments over the thick filaments.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nLOCOMOTION AND MOVEMENT 307\n\nMuscle contraction is initiated by a signal sent by the central nervous\n\nsystem (CNS) via a motor neuron. A motor neuron alongwith the muscle\n\nfibres connected to it constitute a motor unit. The junction between a\n\nmotor neuron and the sarcolemma of the muscle fibre is called the\n\nneuromuscular junction or motor-end plate. A neural signal reaching\n\nthis junction releases a neurotransmitter (Acetyl choline) which generates\n\nan action potential in the sarcolemma. This spreads through the muscle\n\nfibre and causes the release of calcium ions into the sarcoplasm. Increase\n\nin Ca++ level leads to the binding of calcium with a subunit of troponin on\n\nactin filaments and thereby remove the masking of active sites for myosin.\n\nUtilising the energy from ATP hydrolysis, the myosin head now binds to\n\nthe exposed active sites on actin to form a cross bridge (Figure 20.4). This\n\npulls the attached actin filaments towards the centre of ‘A’ band. The\n\n‘Z’ line attached to these actins are also pulled inwards thereby causing a\n\nshortening of the sarcomere, i.e., contraction. It is clear from the above\n\nsteps, that during shortening of the muscle, i.e., contraction, the ‘I’ bands\n\nget reduced, whereas the ‘A’ bands retain the length (Figure 20.5). The\n\nmyosin, releasing the ADP and P\n1\n goes back to its relaxed state. A new\n\nATP binds and the cross-bridge is broken (Figure 20.4). The ATP is again\n\nhydrolysed by the myosin head and the cycle of cross bridge formation\n\nFigure 20.4 Stages in cross bridge formation, rotation of head and breaking of\ncross bridge\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n308 BIOLOGY\n\nand breakage is repeated causing further sliding. The process continues\n\ntill the Ca++ ions are pumped back to the sarcoplasmic cisternae resulting\n\nin the masking of actin filaments. This causes the return of ‘Z’ lines back\n\nto their original position, i.e., relaxation. The reaction time of the fibres\n\ncan vary in different muscles. Repeated activation of the muscles can lead\n\nto the accumulation of lactic acid due to anaerobic breakdown of glycogen\n\nin them, causing fatigue. Muscle contains a red coloured oxygen storing\n\npigment called myoglobin. Myoglobin content is high in some of the\n\nmuscles which gives a reddish appearance. Such muscles are called the\n\nRed fibres. These muscles also contain plenty of mitochondria which can\n\nutilise the large amount of oxygen stored in them for ATP production.\n\nThese muscles, therefore, can also be called aerobic muscles. On the\n\nother hand, some of the muscles possess very less quantity of myoglobin\n\nand therefore, appear pale or whitish. These are the White fibres. Number\n\nof mitochondria are also few in them, but the amount of sarcoplasmic\n\nreticulum is high. They depend on anaerobic process for energy.\n\nFigure 20.5 Sliding-filament theory of muscle contraction (movement of the thin\nfilaments and the relative size of the I band and H zones)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nLOCOMOTION AND MOVEMENT 309\n\n20.3 SKELETAL SYSTEM\n\nSkeletal system consists of a framework of bones and a few cartilages.\n\nThis system has a significant role in movement shown by the body.\n\nImagine chewing food without  jaw bones and walking around without\n\nthe limb bones. Bone and cartilage are specialised connective tissues.\n\nThe former has a very hard matrix due to calcium salts in it and the latter\n\nhas slightly pliable matrix due to chondroitin salts. In human beings,\n\nthis system is made up of 206 bones and a few cartilages. It is grouped\n\ninto two principal divisions – the axial and the appendicular skeleton.\n\nAxial skeleton comprises 80 bones distributed along the main axis\n\nof the body. The skull, vertebral column, sternum and ribs constitute\n\naxial skeleton. The skull (Figure 20.6) is composed of two sets of bones –\n\ncranial and facial, that totals to 22 bones. Cranial bones are 8 in number.\n\nThey form the hard protective outer covering, cranium for the brain. The\n\nfacial region is made up of 14 skeletal elements which form the front part\n\nof the skull. A single U-shaped bone called hyoid is present at the base of\n\nthe buccal cavity and it is also included in the skull. Each middle ear\n\ncontains three tiny bones – Malleus, Incus and Stapes, collectively called\n\nEar Ossicles. The skull region articulates with the superior region of the\n\nParietal\nbone\n\nFrontal bone\n\nTemporal\nbone\n\nOccipital\nbone\n\nOccipital\ncondyle\n\nSphenoid bone\n\nEthmoid bone\n\nLacrimal bone\n\nNasal bone\n\nZygomatic bone\n\nMaxilla\n\nMandible\n\nHyoid bone\n\nFigure 20.6 Diagrammatic view of human skull\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n310 BIOLOGY\n\nvertebral column with the help of two occipital\n\ncondyles (dicondylic skull).\n\nOur vertebral column (Figure 20.7) is\n\nformed by 26 serially arranged units called\n\nvertebrae and is dorsally placed. It extends from\n\nthe base of the skull and constitutes the main\n\nframework of the trunk. Each vertebra has a\n\ncentral hollow portion (neural canal) through\n\nwhich the spinal cord passes. First vertebra is\n\nthe atlas and it articulates with the occipital\n\ncondyles. The vertebral column is differentiated\n\ninto cervical (7), thoracic (12), lumbar (5), sacral\n\n(1-fused) and coccygeal (1-fused) regions\n\nstarting from the skull. The number of cervical\n\nvertebrae are seven in almost all mammals\n\nincluding human beings. The vertebral column\n\nprotects the spinal cord, supports the head and\n\nserves as the point of attachment for the ribs\n\nand musculature of the back. Sternum is a\n\nflat bone on the ventral midline of thorax.\n\nThere are 12 pairs of ribs. Each rib is a\n\nthin flat bone connected dorsally to the\n\nvertebral column and ventrally to the sternum.\n\nIt has two articulation surfaces on its dorsal\n\nend and is hence called bicephalic. First seven\n\npairs of ribs are called true ribs. Dorsally, they\n\nare attached to the thoracic vertebrae and\n\nventrally connected to the sternum with the\n\nhelp of hyaline cartilage. The 8th, 9th and 10th\n\npairs of ribs do not articulate directly with the\n\nsternum but join the seventh rib with the help\n\nof hyaline cartilage. These are called\n\nvertebrochondral (false) ribs. Last 2 pairs (11th\n\nand 12th) of ribs are not connected ventrally\n\nand are therefore, called floating ribs. Thoracic\n\nvertebrae, ribs and sternum together form the\n\nrib cage (Figure 20.8).\n\nThe bones of the limbs alongwith their\n\ngirdles constitute the appendicular skeleton.\n\nEach limb is made of 30 bones. The bones of\n\nthe hand (fore limb) are humerus, radius and\n\nCervical vertebra\n\nIntervertebral\ndisc\n\nSacrum\n\nCoccyx\n\nThoracic\nvertebra\n\nLumbar\nvertebra\n\nFigure 20.7  Vertebral column (right lateral view)\n\nFigure 20.8  Ribs and rib cage\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nLOCOMOTION AND MOVEMENT 311\n\nFigure 20.9 Right pectoral girdle and upper\narm. (frontal view)\n\nulna, carpals (wrist bones – 8 in number),\n\nmetacarpals (palm bones – 5 in number) and\n\nphalanges (digits – 14 in number) (Figure\n\n20.9). Femur (thigh bone – the longest bone),\n\ntibia and fibula, tarsals (ankle bones – 7 in\n\nnumber), metatarsals (5 in number) and\n\nphalanges (digits – 14 in number) are the\n\nbones of the legs (hind limb) (Figure 20.10). A\n\ncup shaped bone called patella cover the knee\n\nventrally (knee cap).\n\nPectoral and Pelvic girdle bones help in\n\nthe articulation of the upper and the lower limbs\n\nrespectively with the axial skeleton. Each\n\ngirdle is formed of two halves. Each half of\n\npectoral girdle consists of a clavicle and a\n\nscapula (Figure 20.9). Scapula is a large\n\ntriangular flat bone situated in the dorsal part\n\nof the thorax between the second and the\n\nseventh ribs. The dorsal, flat, triangular body\n\nof scapula has a slightly elevated ridge called\n\nthe spine which projects as a flat, expanded\n\nprocess called the acromion. The clavicle\n\narticulates with this. Below the acromion is a\n\ndepression called the glenoid cavity which\n\narticulates with the head of the humerus to\n\nform the shoulder joint. Each clavicle is a long\n\nslender bone with two curvatures. This bone\n\nis commonly called the collar bone.\n\nPelvic girdle consists of two coxal bones\n\n(Figure 20.10). Each coxal bone is formed by\n\nthe fusion of three bones – ilium, ischium and\n\npubis. At the point of fusion of the above bones\n\nis a cavity called acetabulum to which the thigh\n\nbone articulates. The two halves of the pelvic\n\ngirdle meet ventrally to form the pubic\n\nsymphysis containing fibrous cartilage.\n\n20.4 JOINTS\n\nJoints are essential for all types of movements\n\ninvolving the bony parts of the body.\n\nLocomotory movements are no exception to\n\nFigure 20.10 Right pelvic girdle and lower limb\nbones (frontal view)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n312 BIOLOGY\n\nthis. Joints are points of contact between bones, or between bones and\n\ncartilages. Force generated by the muscles is used to carry out movement\n\nthrough joints, where the joint acts as a fulcrum. The movability at these\n\njoints vary depending on different factors. Joints have been classified into\n\nthree major structural forms, namely, fibrous, cartilaginous and synovial.\n\nFibrous joints do not allow any movement. This type of joint is shown\n\nby the flat skull bones which fuse end-to-end with the help of dense fibrous\n\nconnective tissues in the form of sutures, to form the cranium.\n\nIn cartilaginous joints, the bones involved are joined together with\n\nthe help of cartilages. The joint between the adjacent vertebrae in the\n\nvertebral column is of this pattern and it permits limited movements.\n\nSynovial joints are characterised by the presence of a fluid filled synovial\n\ncavity between the articulating surfaces of the two bones. Such an arragement\n\nallows considerable movement. These joints help in locomotion and many\n\nother movements. Ball and socket joint (between humerus and pectoral\n\ngirdle), hinge joint (knee joint), pivot joint (between atlas and axis), gliding\n\njoint (between the carpals) and saddle joint (between carpal and metacarpal\n\nof thumb) are some examples.\n\n20.5 DISORDERS OF MUSCULAR AND SKELETAL SYSTEM\n\nMyasthenia gravis: Auto immune disorder affecting neuromuscular\n\njunction leading to fatigue, weakening and paralysis of skeletal muscle.\n\nMuscular dystrophy: Progressive degeneration of skeletal muscle mostly\n\ndue to genetic disorder.\n\nTetany: Rapid spasms (wild contractions) in muscle due to low Ca++ in\n\nbody fluid.\n\nArthritis: Inflammation of joints.\n\nOsteoporosis: Age-related disorder characterised by decreased bone mass\n\nand increased chances of fractures. Decreased levels of estrogen is a\n\ncommon cause.\n\nGout: Inflammation of joints due to accumulation of uric acid crystals.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nMovement is an essential feature of all living beings. Protoplasmic streaming, ciliary\n\nmovements, movements of fins, limbs, wings, etc., are some forms exhibited by\n\nanimals. A voluntary movement which causes the animal to change its place, is\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nLOCOMOTION AND MOVEMENT 313\n\ncalled locomotion. Animals move generally in search of food, shelter, mate, breeding\n\nground, better climate or to protect themselves.\n\nThe cells of the human body exhibit amoeboid, ciliary and muscular\n\nmovements. Locomotion and many other movements require coordinated muscular\n\nactivities. Three types of muscles are present in our body. Skeletal muscles are\n\nattached to skeletal elements. They appear striated and are voluntary in nature.\n\nVisceral muscles, present in the inner walls of visceral organs are nonstriated and\n\ninvoluntary. Cardiac muscles are the muscles of the heart. They are striated,\n\nbranched and involuntary. Muscles possess excitability, contractility, extensibility\n\nand elasticity.\n\nMuscle fibre is the anatomical unit of muscle. Each muscle fibre has many\n\nparallelly arranged myofibrils. Each myofibril contains many serially arranged\n\nunits called sarcomere which are the functional units. Each sarcomere has a central\n\n‘A’ band made of thick myosin filaments, and two half ‘I’ bands made of thin actin\n\nfilaments on either side of it marked by ‘Z’  lines. Actin and myosin are polymerised\n\nproteins with contractility. The active sites for myosin on resting actin filament are\n\nmasked by a protein-troponin. Myosin head contains ATPase and has ATP binding\n\nsites and active sites for actin. A motor neuron carries signal to the muscle fibre\n\nwhich generates an action potential in it. This causes the release of Ca++ from\n\nsarcoplasmic reticulum. Ca++ activates actin which binds to the myosin head to\n\nform a cross bridge. These cross bridges pull the actin filaments causing them to\n\nslide over the myosin filaments and thereby causing contraction. Ca++ are then\n\nreturned to sarcoplasmic reticulum which inactivate the actin. Cross bridges are\n\nbroken and the muscles relax.\n\nRepeated stimulation of muscles leads to fatigue. Muscles are classified as\n\nRed and White fibres based primarily on the amount of red coloured myoglobin\n\npigment in them.\n\nBones and cartilages constitute our skeletal system. The skeletal system is\n\ndivisible into axial and appendicular. Skull, vertebral column, ribs and sternum\n\nconstitute the axial skeleton. Limb bones and girdles form the appendicular\n\nskeleton. Three types of joints are formed between bones or between bone and\n\ncartilage – fibrous, cartilaginous and synovial. Synovial joints allow considerable\n\nmovements and therefore, play a significant role in locomotion.\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1.
