Similarly, if we were to study the internal structure, one also\n\nfinds several similarities as well as differences. This chapter introduces\n\nyou to the internal structure and functional organisation of higher plants.\n\nStudy of internal structure of plants is called anatomy. Plants have cells\n\nas the basic unit, cells are organised into tissues and in turn the tissues\n\nare organised into organs. Different organs in a plant show differences in\n\ntheir internal structure. Within angiosperms, the monocots and dicots\n\nare also seen to be anatomically different. Internal structures also show\n\nadaptations to diverse environments.\n\n6.1 THE TISSUES\n\nA tissue is a group of cells having a common origin and usually performing\n\na common function. A plant is made up of different kinds of tissues. Tissues\n\nare classified into two main groups, namely, meristematic  and permanent\n\ntissues based on whether the cells being formed are capable of dividing\n\nor not.\n\n6.1.1 Meristematic Tissues\n\nGrowth in plants is largely restricted to specialised regions of active cell division\n\ncalled meristems (Gk. meristos: divided). Plants have different kinds of\n\nmeristems. The meristems which occur at the tips of roots and shoots and\n\nproduce primary tissues are called apical meristems (Figure 6.1).\n\nANATOMY OF FLOWERING PLANTS\n\nCHAPTER  6\n\n6.1 The Tissues\n\n6.2 The Tissue\n\nSystem\n\n6.3 Anatomy of\n\nDicotyledonous\n\nand\n\nMonocotyledonous\n\nPlants\n\n6.4 Secondary\n\nGrowth\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nANATOMY OF FLOWERING PLANTS 85\n\nRoot apical meristem occupies the tip of a root while the shoot apical\n\nmeristem occupies the distant most region of the stem axis. During the\n\nformation of leaves and elongation of stem, some cells ‘left behind’ from\n\nshoot apical meristem, constitute the axillary bud. Such buds are present\n\nin the axils of leaves and are capable of forming a branch or a flower. The\n\nmeristem which occurs between mature tissues is known as intercalary\n\nmeristem. They occur in grasses and regenerate parts removed by the\n\ngrazing herbivores. Both apical meristems and intercalary meristems are\n\nprimary meristems because they appear early in life of a plant and\n\ncontribute to the formation of the primary plant body.\n\nThe meristem that occurs in the mature regions of roots and shoots of\n\nmany plants, particularly those that produce woody axis and appear\n\nlater than primary meristem is called the secondary or lateral meristem.\n\nThey are cylindrical meristems. Fascicular vascular cambium,\n\ninterfascicular cambium and cork-cambium are examples of lateral\n\nmeristems. These are responsible for producing the secondary tissues.\n\nFollowing divisions of cells in both primary and as well as secondary\n\nmeristems, the newly formed cells become structurally and functionally\n\nspecialised and lose the ability to divide. Such cells are termed permanent\n\nor mature cells and constitute the permanent tissues. During the\n\nformation of the primary plant body, specific regions of the apical meristem\n\nproduce dermal tissues, ground tissues and vascular tissues.\n\nCentral cylinder\n\nCortex\n\nProtoderm\n\nInitials of central\ncylinder\n\nand cortex\n\nInitials of\nroot cap\n\nRoot cap\n\nRoot apical\nmeristem\n\nLeaf primordium\n\nShoot apical\nMeristematic zone\n\nAxillary bud\n\nDifferentiating\nvascular tissue\n\nFigure 6.1  Apical meristem: (a) Root  (b) Shoot\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n86 BIOLOGY\n\n6.1.2 Permanent Tissues\n\nThe cells of the permanent tissues do not generally\n\ndivide further. Permanent tissues having all cells\n\nsimilar in structure and function are called simple\n\ntissues. Permanent tissues having many different\n\ntypes of cells are called complex tissues.\n\n6.1.2.1 Simple Tissues\n\nA simple tissue is made of only one type of cells.\n\nThe various simple tissues in plants are\n\nparenchyma, collenchyma and sclerenchyma\n\n(Figure 6.2). Parenchyma forms the  major\n\ncomponent within organs. The cells of the\n\nparenchyma  are generally isodiametric. They\n\nmay be spherical, oval, round, polygonal or\n\nelongated in shape. Their walls are thin and made\n\nup of cellulose. They may either be closely packed\n\nor have small intercellular spaces. The\n\nparenchyma performs  various functions like\n\nphotosynthesis, storage, secretion.\n\nThe collenchyma occurs in layers below the\n\nepidermis in most of the dicotyledonous plants. It is\n\nfound either as a homogeneous layer or in patches.\n\nIt consists of cells which are much thickened at the\n\ncorners due to a deposition of cellulose,\n\nhemicellulose and pectin. Collenchymatous cells\n\nmay be oval, spherical or polygonal and often\n\ncontain chloroplasts. These cells assimilate food\n\nwhen they contain chloroplasts. Intercellular spaces\n\nare absent. They provide mechanical support to the\n\ngrowing parts of the plant such as young stem and\n\npetiole of a leaf.\n\nSclerenchyma consists of long, narrow cells\n\nwith thick and lignified cell walls having a few or\n\nnumerous pits. They are usually dead and without\n\nprotoplasts. On the basis of variation in form,\n\nstructure, origin and development, sclerenchyma\n\nmay be either fibres or sclereids. The fibres are\n\nthick-walled, elongated and pointed cells,\n\ngenerally occuring in groups, in various parts of\n\nthe plant. The sclereids are spherical, oval or\n\ncylindrical, highly thickened dead cells with very\n\nIntercelluar space\n\nFigure 6.2 Simple tissues :\n(a) Parenchyma\n(b) Collenchyma\n(c) Sclerenchyma\n\nA fibre\n\nA sclereid\n\n(c)\n\nLumen\n\nThick\ncell wall\n\nLumen\n\nPits\n\nThick\ncell wall\n\n(b)\n\nThickened corners\n\nProtoplasm\n\nVacuole\n\nCell wall\n\n(a)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nANATOMY OF FLOWERING PLANTS 87\n\nnarrow cavities (lumen). These are commonly found in the fruit\n\nwalls of nuts; pulp of fruits like guava, pear and sapota; seed\n\ncoats of legumes and leaves of tea. Sclerenchyma provides\n\nmechanical support to organs.\n\n6.1.2.2 Complex Tissues\n\nThe complex tissues are made of more than one type of cells\n\nand these work together as a unit. Xylem and phloem constitute\n\nthe complex tissues in plants (Figure 6.3).\n\nXylem functions as a conducting tissue for water and\n\nminerals from roots to the stem and leaves. It also provides\n\nmechanical strength to the plant parts. It is composed of four\n\ndifferent kinds of elements, namely, tracheids, vessels, xylem\n\nfibres and xylem parenchyma. Gymnosperms lack vessels in\n\ntheir xylem. Tracheids are elongated or tube like cells with\n\nthick and lignified walls and tapering ends. These are dead and\n\nare without protoplasm. The inner layers of the cell walls have\n\nthickenings which vary in form.  In flowering plants, tracheids\n\nand vessels are the main water transporting elements. Vessel is\n\na long cylindrical tube-like structure made up of many cells\n\ncalled vessel members, each with lignified walls and a large\n\ncentral cavity. The vessel cells are also devoid of protoplasm.\n\nVessel members are interconnected through perforations in their\n\ncommon walls. The presence of vessels is a characteristic feature\n\nof angiosperms. Xylem fibres have highly thickened walls and\n\nobliterated central lumens. These may either be septate or\n\naseptate. Xylem parenchyma cells are living and thin-walled,\n\nand their cell walls are made up of cellulose. They store food\n\nmaterials in the form of starch or fat, and other substances like\n\ntannins. The radial conduction of water takes place by the ray\n\nparenchymatous cells.\n\nPrimary xylem is of two types – protoxylem and metaxylem.\n\nThe first formed primary xylem elements are called protoxylem\n\nand the later formed primary xylem is called metaxylem. In\n\nstems, the protoxylem lies towards the centre (pith) and the\n\nmetaxylem lies towards the periphery of the organ. This type\n\nof primary xylem is called endarch. In roots, the protoxylem\n\nlies towards periphery and metaxylem lies towards the centre.\n\nSuch arrangement of primary xylem is called exarch.\n\nPhloem transports food materials, usually from leaves to\n\nother parts of the plant. Phloem in angiosperms is composed\n\nof sieve tube elements, companion cells, phloem parenchyma\n\nPhloem\nparenchyma\n\nCompanion\ncell\n\n(b)\n\nSieve pore\n\nSieve tube\nelement\n\nFigure 6.3 (a) Xylem\n      (b) Phloem\n\n(a)\n\nTracheid\n\nVessels\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n88 BIOLOGY\n\nand phloem fibres. Gymnosperms have albuminous cells and sieve cells.\n\nThey lack sieve tubes and companion cells. Sieve tube elements are\n\nalso long, tube-like structures, arranged  longitudinally and are\n\nassociated with the companion cells. Their end walls are perforated in a\n\nsieve-like manner to form the sieve plates. A mature sieve element\n\npossesses a peripheral cytoplasm and a large vacuole but lacks a nucleus.\n\nThe functions of sieve tubes are controlled by the nucleus of companion\n\ncells. The companion cells are specialised parenchymatous cells, which\n\nare closely associated with sieve tube elements. The sieve tube elements\n\nand companion cells are connected by pit fields present between their\n\ncommon longitudinal walls. The companion cells help in maintaining the\n\npressure gradient in the sieve tubes. Phloem parenchyma is made up\n\nof elongated, tapering cylindrical cells which have dense cytoplasm and\n\nnucleus. The cell wall is composed of cellulose and has pits through which\n\nplasmodesmatal connections exist between the cells. The phloem\n\nparenchyma stores food material and other substances like resins, latex\n\nand mucilage. Phloem parenchyma is absent in most of the\n\nmonocotyledons. Phloem fibres (bast fibres) are made up of\n\nsclerenchymatous cells. These are generally absent in the primary phloem\n\nbut are found in the secondary phloem. These are much elongated,\n\nunbranched and have pointed, needle like apices. The cell wall of phloem\n\nfibres is quite thick. At maturity, these fibres lose their protoplasm and\n\nbecome dead. Phloem fibres of jute, flax and hemp are used commercially.\n\nThe first formed primary phloem consists of narrow sieve tubes and is\n\nreferred to as protophloem and the later formed phloem has bigger sieve\n\ntubes and is referred to as metaphloem.\n\n6.2 THE TISSUE SYSTEM\n\nWe were discussing types of tissues based on the types of cells present.\n\nLet us now consider how tissues vary depending on their location in the\n\nplant body. Their structure and function would also be dependent on\n\nlocation. On the basis of their structure and location, there are three types\n\nof tissue systems. These are the epidermal tissue system, the ground or\n\nfundamental tissue system and the vascular or conducting tissue system.\n\n6.2.1 Epidermal Tissue System\n\nThe epidermal tissue system forms the outer-most covering of the whole\n\nplant body and comprises epidermal cells, stomata and the epidermal\n\nappendages – the trichomes and hairs. The epidermis is the outermost\n\nlayer of the primary plant body. It is made up of elongated, compactly\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nANATOMY OF FLOWERING PLANTS 89\n\nThe cells of epidermis bear a number of hairs. The root hairs are\n\nunicellular elongations of the epidermal cells and help absorb water and\n\nminerals from the soil. On the stem the epidermal hairs are called\n\ntrichomes. The trichomes in the shoot system are usually multicellular.\n\nThey may be branched  or unbranched and soft or stiff. They may even\n\nbe secretory. The trichomes help in preventing water loss due to\n\ntranspiration.\n\n6.2.2 The Ground Tissue System\n\nAll tissues except epidermis and vascular bundles constitute the ground\n\ntissue. It consists of simple tissues such as parenchyma, collenchyma\n\nand sclerenchyma. Parenchymatous cells are usually present in cortex,\n\npericycle, pith and medullary rays, in the primary stems and roots. In\n\nleaves, the ground tissue consists of thin-walled chloroplast containing\n\ncells and is called mesophyll.\n\narranged cells, which form a continuous layer. Epidermis is usually single-\n\nlayered. Epidermal cells are parenchymatous with a small amount of\n\ncytoplasm lining the cell wall and a large vacuole. The outside of the\n\nepidermis is often covered with a waxy thick layer called the cuticle which\n\nprevents the loss of water. Cuticle is absent in roots. Stomata are structures\n\npresent in the epidermis of leaves. Stomata regulate the process of\n\ntranspiration and gaseous exchange. Each stoma is composed of two bean-\n\nshaped cells known as guard cells which enclose stomatal pore. In grasses,\n\nthe guard cells are dumb-bell shaped. The outer walls of guard cells (away\n\nfrom the stomatal pore) are thin and the inner walls (towards the stomatal\n\npore) are highly thickened. The guard cells possess chloroplasts and\n\nregulate the opening and closing of stomata. Sometimes, a few epidermal\n\ncells, in the vicinity of the guard cells become specialised in their shape and\n\nsize and are known as subsidiary cells. The stomatal aperture, guard\n\ncells and the surrounding subsidiary cells are together called stomatal\n\napparatus (Figure 6.4).\n\nFigure 6.4 Diagrammatic representation: (a) stomata with bean-shaped guard cells\n(b) stomata with dumb-bell shaped guard cell\n\nEpidermal cells\n\nSubsidiary cells\n\nGuard cells\n\nStomatal\npore\n\nChloroplast\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n90 BIOLOGY\n\n6.2.3 The Vascular Tissue System\n\nThe vascular system consists of complex tissues,\n\nthe phloem and the xylem.The xylem and\n\nphloem together constitute vascular bundles\n\n(Figure 6.5). In dicotyledonous stems, cambium\n\nis present between phloem and xylem. Such\n\nvascular bundles because of the presence of\n\ncambium possess the ability to form secondary\n\nxylem and phloem tissues, and hence are called\n\nopen vascular bundles. In the monocotyledons,\n\nthe vascular bundles have no cambium present\n\nin them. Hence, since they do not form secondary\n\ntissues they are referred to as closed. When\n\nxylem and phloem within a vascular bundle are\n\narranged in an alternate manner along the\n\ndifferent radii, the arrangement is called radial\n\nsuch as in roots. In conjoint type of vascular\n\nbundles, the xylem and phloem are jointly\n\nsituated  along the same radius of vascular\n\nbundles. Such vascular bundles are common\n\nin stems and leaves. The conjoint vascular\n\nbundles usually have the phloem located only\n\non the outer side of xylem.\n\n6.3 ANATOMY OF DICOTYLEDONOUS AND\nMONOCOTYLEDONOUS PLANTS\n\nFor a better understanding of tissue\n\norganisation of roots, stems and leaves, it is\n\nconvenient to study the transverse sections of\n\nthe mature zones of these organs.\n\n6.3.1 Dicotyledonous Root\n\nLook at Figure 6.6 (a), it shows the transverse\n\nsection of the sunflower root. The internal tissue\n\norganisation is as follows:\n\nThe outermost layer is epiblema. Many of\n\nthe cells of epiblema protrude in the form of\n\nunicellular root hairs. The cortex consists of\n\nseveral layers of thin-walled parenchyma cells\n\nFigure 6.5 Various types of vascular bundles :\n(a) radial  (b) conjoint closed\n(c) conjoint open\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nANATOMY OF FLOWERING PLANTS 91\n\nwith intercellular spaces. The innermost\n\nlayer of the cortex is called endodermis.\n\nIt comprises a single layer of barrel-shaped\n\ncells without any intercellular spaces. The\n\ntangential as well as radial walls of the\n\nendodermal cells have a deposition of\n\nwater-impermeable, waxy material suberin\n\nin the form of casparian strips. Next to\n\nendodermis lies a few layers of thick-walled\n\nparenchyomatous cells referred to as\n\npericycle.  Initiation of lateral roots and\n\nvascular cambium during the secondary\n\ngrowth takes place in these cells. The pith\n\nis small or inconspicuous. The\n\nparenchymatous cells which lie between\n\nthe xylem and the phloem are called\n\nconjuctive tissue. There are usually two\n\nto four xylem and phloem patches. Later,\n\na cambium ring develops between the\n\nxylem and phloem. All tissues on the\n\ninnerside of the endodermis such as\n\npericycle, vascular bundles and pith\n\nconstitute the stele.\n\n6.3.2 Monocotyledonous Root\n\nThe anatomy of the monocot root is similar\n\nto the dicot root in many respects (Figure\n\n6.6 b). It has epidermis, cortex, endodermis,\n\npericycle, vascular bundles and pith. As\n\ncompared to the dicot root which have fewer\n\nxylem bundles, there are usually more than\n\nsix (polyarch) xylem bundles in the monocot\n\nroot. Pith is large and well developed.\n\nMonocotyledonous roots do not undergo\n\nany secondary growth.\n\n6.3.3 Dicotyledonous Stem\n\nThe transverse section of a typical young\n\ndicotyledonous stem shows that the epidermis\n\nis the outermost protective layer of the stem\n\nRoot hair\n\nEpidermis\n\nCortex\n\nEndodermis\n\nProtoxylem\n\nMetaxylem\n\nPith\n\nPhloem\n\n(a)\n\nPericycle\n\nRoot hair\n\nCortex\n\nEndodermis\n\nPhloem\n\nProtoxylem\n\nPith\n\nMetaxylem\n\n(b)\n\nEpidermis\n\nPericycle\n\nFigure 6.6 T.S. : (a) Dicot root (Primary)\n(b) Monocot root\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n92 BIOLOGY\n\n(Figure 6.7 a). Covered with a thin layer of cuticle, it may bear trichomes and\n\na few stomata. The cells arranged in multiple layers between epidermis and\n\npericycle constitute the cortex. It consists of three sub-zones. The outer\n\nhypodermis, consists of a few layers of collenchymatous cells just below the\n\nepidermis, which provide mechanical strength to the young stem. Cortical\n\nlayers below hypodermis consist of rounded thin walled parenchymatous\n\ncells with conspicuous intercellular spaces. The innermost layer of the cortex\n\nis called the endodermis. The cells of the endodermis are rich in starch\n\ngrains and the layer is also referred to as the starch sheath. Pericycle is\n\nFigure 6.7  T.S. of stem :  (a) Dicot  (b) Monocot\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nANATOMY OF FLOWERING PLANTS 93\n\npresent on the inner side of the endodermis and above the phloem in the\n\nform of semi-lunar patches of sclerenchyma. In between the vascular bundles\n\nthere are a few layers of radially placed parenchymatous cells, which constitute\n\nmedullary rays. A large number of vascular bundles are arranged in a ring ;\n\nthe ‘ring’ arrangement of vascular bundles is a characteristic of dicot stem.\n\nEach vascular bundle is conjoint, open, and with endarch protoxylem. A\n\nlarge number of rounded, parenchymatous cells with large intercellular\n\nspaces which occupy the central portion of the stem constitute the pith.\n\n6.3.4 Monocotyledonous Stem\n\nThe monocot stem has a sclerenchymatous hypodermis, a large number\n\nof scattered vascular bundles, each surrounded by a sclerenchymatous\n\nbundle sheath, and a large, conspicuous parenchymatous ground tissue\n\n(Figure 6.7b). Vascular bundles are conjoint  and closed. Peripheral\n\nvascular bundles are generally smaller than the centrally located ones.\n\nThe phloem parenchyma is absent, and water-containing cavities are\n\npresent within the vascular bundles.\n\n6.3.5 Dorsiventral (Dicotyledonous) Leaf\n\nThe vertical section of a dorsiventral leaf through the lamina shows three\n\nmain parts, namely, epidermis, mesophyll and vascular system. The\n\nepidermis which covers both the upper surface (adaxial epidermis) and\n\nlower  surface (abaxial epidermis) of the leaf has a conspicuous cuticle.\n\nThe abaxial epidermis generally bears more stomata than the adaxial\n\nepidermis. The latter may even lack stomata. The tissue between the upper\n\nand the lower epidermis is called the mesophyll. Mesophyll, which\n\npossesses chloroplasts and carry out photosynthesis, is made up of\n\nparenchyma. It has two types of cells – the palisade parenchyma and\n\nthe spongy parenchyma. The adaxially placed palisade parenchyma is\n\nmade up of elongated cells, which are arranged vertically and parallel to\n\neach other. The oval or round and loosely arranged spongy parenchyma\n\nis situated below the palisade cells and extends to the lower epidermis.\n\nThere are numerous large spaces and air cavities between these cells.\n\nVascular system includes vascular bundles, which can be seen in the\n\nveins and the midrib. The size of the vascular bundles are dependent on\n\nthe size of the veins. The veins vary in thickness in the reticulate venation\n\nof the dicot leaves. The vascular bundles are surrounded by a layer of\n\nthick walled bundle sheath cells. Look at Figure 6.8 (a) and find the\n\nposition of xylem in the vascular bundle.\n\n6.3.6 Isobilateral (Monocotyledonous) Leaf\n\nThe anatomy of isobilateral leaf is similar to that of the dorsiventral leaf in\n\nmany ways. It shows the following characteristic differences. In an\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n94 BIOLOGY\n\nisobilateral leaf, the stomata are present\n\non both the surfaces of the epidermis; and\n\nthe mesophyll is not differentiated into\n\npalisade and spongy parenchyma (Figure\n\n6.8 b).\n\nIn grasses, certain adaxial epidermal\n\ncells along the veins modify themselves\n\ninto large, empty, colourless cells. These\n\nare called bulliform cells. When the\n\nbulliform cells in the leaves have absorbed\n\nwater and are turgid, the leaf surface is\n\nexposed. When they are flaccid due to\n\nwater stress, they make the leaves curl\n\ninwards to minimise water loss.\n\nThe parallel venation in monocot\n\nleaves is reflected in the near similar sizes\n\nof vascular bundles (except in main veins)\n\nas seen in vertical sections of the leaves.\n\n6.4 SECONDARY GROWTH\n\nThe growth of the roots and stems in\n\nlength with the help of apical meristem is\n\ncalled the primary growth. Apart from\n\nprimary growth most dicotyledonous\n\nplants exhibit an increase in girth. This\n\nincrease is called the secondary growth.\n\nThe tissues involved in secondary growth\n\nare the two lateral meristems: vascular\n\ncambium and cork cambium.\n\n6.4.1 Vascular Cambium\n\nThe meristematic layer that is responsible\n\nfor cutting off vascular tissues – xylem and\n\npholem – is called vascular cambium. In\n\nthe young stem it is present in patches as\n\na single layer between the xylem and\n\nphloem. Later it forms a complete ring.\n\n6.4.1.1 Formation of cambial ring\n\nIn dicot stems, the cells of cambium present\n\nbetween primary xylem and primary\n\nphloem is the intrafascicular cambium.\n\nFigure 6.8  T.S. of leaf : (a) Dicot  (b) Monocot\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nANATOMY OF FLOWERING PLANTS 95\n\nThe cells of medullary rays, adjoining these intrafascicular cambium become\n\nmeristematic and form the interfascicular cambium. Thus, a continuous\n\nring of cambium is formed.\n\n6.4.1.2 Activity of the cambial ring\n\nThe cambial ring becomes active and begins to cut off new cells, both\n\ntowards the inner and the outer sides. The cells cut off towards pith,\n\nmature into secondary xylem and the cells cut off towards periphery\n\nmature into secondary phloem. The cambium is generally more active\n\non the inner side than on the outer. As a result, the amount of secondary\n\nxylem produced is more than secondary phloem and soon forms a\n\ncompact mass. The primary and secondary phloems get gradually\n\ncrushed due to the continued formation and accumulation of secondary\n\nxylem. The primary xylem however remains more or less intact, in or\n\naround the centre. At some places, the cambium forms a narrow band of\n\nparenchyma, which passes through the secondary xylem and the\n\nsecondary phloem in the radial directions. These are the secondary\n\nmedullary rays (Figure 6.9).\n\nFigure 6.9  Secondary growth in a dicot stem (diagrammatic) – stages in transverse views\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n96 BIOLOGY\n\n6.4.1.3 Spring wood and autumn wood\n\nThe activity of cambium is under the control of many physiological and\n\nenvironmental factors. In temperate regions, the climatic conditions are\n\nnot uniform through the year. In the spring season, cambium is very\n\nactive and produces a large number of xylary elements having vessels\n\nwith wider cavities. The wood formed during this season is called spring\n\nwood or early wood. In winter, the cambium is less active and forms\n\nfewer xylary elements that have narrow vessels, and this wood is called\n\nautumn wood or late wood.\n\nThe spring wood is lighter in colour and has a lower density whereas\n\nthe autumn wood is darker and has a higher density. The two kinds of\n\nwoods that appear as alternate concentric rings, constitute an annual ring.\n\nAnnual rings seen in a cut stem give an estimate of the age of the tree.\n\n6.4.1.4 Heartwood and sapwood\n\nIn old trees, the greater part of secondary xylem is dark brown due to\n\ndeposition of organic compounds like tannins, resins, oils, gums, aromatic\n\nsubstances and essential oils in the central or innermost layers of the stem.\n\nThese substances make it hard, durable and resistant to the attacks of micro-\n\norganisms and insects. This region comprises dead elements with highly\n\nlignified walls and is called heartwood. The heartwood does not conduct\n\nwater but it gives mechanical support to the stem. The peripheral region of\n\nthe secondary xylem, is lighter in colour and is known as the sapwood. It is\n\ninvolved in the conduction of water and minerals from root to leaf.\n\n6.4.2 Cork Cambium\n\nAs the stem continues to increase in girth due to the activity of vascular\n\ncambium, the outer cortical and epidermis layers get broken and need to\n\nbe replaced to provide new protective cell layers. Hence, sooner or later,\n\nanother meristematic tissue called cork cambium or phellogen develops,\n\nusually in the cortex region. Phellogen is a couple of layers thick. It is\n\nmade of narrow, thin-walled and nearly rectangular cells. Phellogen cuts\n\noff cells on both sides. The outer cells differentiate into cork or phellem\n\nwhile the inner cells differentiate into secondary cortex or phelloderm.\n\nThe cork is impervious to water due to suberin deposition in the cell wall.\n\nThe cells of secondary cortex are parenchymatous. Phellogen, phellem,\n\nand phelloderm are collectively known as periderm. Due to activity of\n\nthe cork cambium, pressure builds up on the remaining layers peripheral\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nANATOMY OF FLOWERING PLANTS 97\n\nFigure 6.10  (a) Lenticel and (b) Bark\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\nEpidermis\n\nComplimentary\ncells\n\nCork cambium\n\nSecondary\ncortex\n\n(a)\n\nto phellogen and ultimately these\n\nlayers die and slough off.  Bark is a\n\nnon-technical term that refers to all\n\ntissues exterior to the vascular\n\ncambium, therefore including\n\nsecondary phloem. Bark refers to a\n\nnumber of tissue types, viz.,\n\nperiderm and secondary phloem.\n\nBark that is formed early in the\n\nseason is called early or soft bark.\n\nTowards the end of the season, late\n\nor hard bark is formed. Name the\n\nvarious kinds of cell layers which\n\nconstitute the bark.\n\nAt certain regions, the phellogen\n\ncuts off closely arranged\n\nparenchymatous cells on the outer\n\nside instead of cork cells. These\n\nparenchymatous cells soon rupture\n\nthe epidermis, forming a lens-\n\nshaped openings called lenticels.\n\nLenticels permit the exchange of\n\ngases between the outer atmosphere\n\nand the internal tissue of the stem.\n\nThese occur in most woody trees\n\n(Figure 6.10).\n\n6.4.3 Secondary Growth in\n\nRoots\n\nIn the dicot root, the vascular\n\ncambium is completely secondary in\n\norigin. It originates from the tissue\n\nlocated just below the phloem\n\nbundles, a portion of pericycle tissue,\n\nabove the protoxylem forming a\n\ncomplete and continuous wavy ring,\n\nwhich later becomes circular (Figure\n\n6.11). Further events are similar to\n\nthose already described above for a\n\ndicotyledon stem.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n98 BIOLOGY\n\nSecondary growth also occurs in stems and roots of gymnosperms.\n\nHowever, secondary growth does not occur in monocotyledons.\n\nEpidermis\n\nCortex\n\nPrimary phloem\nCambial ring\nEndodermis\nPericycle\n\nProtoxylem\n\nEpidermis\n\nVascular cambium\n\nSecondary phloem\n\nPrimary xylem\n\nSecondary xylem\n\nCortex\n\nEpidermis/periderm\n\nCortex\n\nPrimary phloem\n\nAnnual ring\n\nSecondary xylem\n\nSecondary\nphloem rays\n\nFigure 6.11  Different stages of the secondary growth in a typical dicot root\n\nCortex\n\nSUMMARY\n\nAnatomically, a plant is made of different kinds of tissues. The plant tissues are\n\nbroadly classified into meristematic (apical, lateral and intercalary) and permanent\n\n(simple and complex). Assimilation of food and its storage, transportation of water,\n\nminerals and photosynthates, and mechanical support are the main functions of\n\ntissues. There are three types of tissue  systems – epidermal, ground and vascular.\n\nThe epidermal tissue systems are made of epidermal cells, stomata and the\n\nepidermal appendages. The ground tissue system forms the main bulk of the\n\nplant. It is divided into three zones – cortex, pericycle and pith. The vascular\n\ntissue system is formed by the xylem and phloem. On the basis of presence of\n\ncambium, location of xylem and phloem, the vascular bundles are of different\n\ntypes. The vascular bundles form the conducting tissue and translocate water,\n\nminerals and food material.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nANATOMY OF FLOWERING PLANTS 99\n\nMonocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants show marked variation in their\n\ninternal structures. They differ in type, number and location of vascular bundles.\n\nThe secondary growth occurs in most of the dicotyledonous roots and stems and\n\nit increases the girth (diameter) of the organs by the activity of the vascular cambium\n\nand the cork cambium. The wood is actually a secondary xylem. There are different\n\ntypes of wood on the basis of their composition and time of production.\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1.
