Monera, Protista, Fungi,\n\nAnimalia and Plantae.  In this chapter, we will deal in detail with further\n\nclassification within Kingdom Plantae popularly known as the ‘plant\n\nkingdom’.\n\nWe must stress here that our understanding of the plant kingdom\n\nhas changed over time. Fungi, and members of the Monera and Protista\n\nhaving cell walls have now been excluded from Plantae though earlier\n\nclassifications placed them in the same kingdom.  So, the cyanobacteria\n\nthat are also referred to as blue green algae are not ‘algae’ any more.  In\n\nthis chapter, we will describe Algae, Bryophytes, Pteridophytes,\n\nGymnosperms and Angiosperms under Plantae .\n\nLet us also look at classification within angiosperms to understand\n\nsome of the concerns  that influenced the classification systems. The\n\nearliest systems of classification used only gross superficial morphological\n\ncharacters such as habit, colour, number and shape of leaves, etc.  They\n\nwere based mainly on vegetative characters or on the androecium\n\nstructure (system given by Linnaeus). Such systems were artificial; they\n\nseparated the closely related species since they were based on a few\n\ncharacteristics. Also, the artificial systems gave equal weightage to\n\nvegetative and sexual characteristics; this is not acceptable since we know\n\nthat often the vegetative characters are more easily affected by\n\nenvironment. As against this, natural classification systems developed,\n\nwhich were based on natural affinities among the organisms and consider,\n\nPLANT KINGDOM\n\nCHAPTER  3\n\n3.1 Algae\n\n3.2 Bryophytes\n\n3.3 Pteridophytes\n\n3.4 Gymnosperms\n\n3.5 Angiosperms\n\n3.6 Plant Life Cycles\n\nand Alternation\n\nof Generations\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n30 BIOLOGY\n\nnot only the external features, but also internal features, like ultra-\n\nstructure, anatomy, embryology and phytochemistry. Such a\n\nclassification for flowering plants was given by George Bentham and\n\nJoseph Dalton Hooker.\n\nAt present phylogenetic classification systems based on\n\nevolutionary relationships between the various organisms are acceptable.\n\nThis assumes that organisms belonging to the same taxa have a common\n\nancestor.   We now use information from many other sources too to help\n\nresolve difficulties in classification.  These become more important when\n\nthere is no supporting fossil evidence.  Numerical Taxonomy which is\n\nnow easily carried out using computers is based on all observable\n\ncharacteristics. Number and codes are assigned to all the characters and\n\nthe data are then processed. In this way each character is given equal\n\nimportance and at the same time hundreds of characters can be\n\nconsidered.  Cytotaxonomy that is based on cytological information like\n\nchromosome number, structure, behaviour and chemotaxonomy that\n\nuses the chemical constituents of the plant to resolve confusions, are also\n\nused by taxonomists these days.\n\n3.1 ALGAE\n\nAlgae are chlorophyll-bearing, simple, thalloid, autotrophic and largely\n\naquatic (both fresh water and marine) organisms. They occur in a\n\nvariety of other habitats: moist stones, soils and wood. Some of them\n\nalso occur in association with fungi (lichen) and animals (e.g., on sloth\n\nbear).\n\nThe form and size of algae is highly variable, ranging from colonial\n\nforms like Volvox and the filamentous forms like Ulothrix and Spirogyra\n\n(Figure 3.1). A few of the marine forms such as kelps, form massive plant\n\nbodies.\n\nThe algae reproduce by vegetative, asexual and sexual methods.\n\nVegetative reproduction is by fragmentation. Each fragment develops into\n\na thallus. Asexual reproduction is by the production of different types of\n\nspores, the most common being the zoospores. They are flagellated\n\n(motile) and on germination gives rise to new plants. Sexual reproduction\n\ntakes place through fusion of two gametes. These gametes can be\n\nflagellated and similar in size (as in Ulothrix) or non-flagellated (non-motile)\n\nbut similar in size (as in Spirogyra). Such reproduction is called\n\nisogamous. Fusion of two gametes dissimilar in size, as in species of\n\nEudorina is termed as anisogamous. Fusion between one large, non-\n\nmotile (static) female gamete and a smaller, motile male gamete is termed\n\noogamous, e.g., Volvox, Fucus.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPLANT KINGDOM 31\n\nFigure 3.1  Algae : (a) Green algae   (i) Volvox         (ii) Ulothrix\n(b) Brown algae  (i) Laminaria   (ii) Fucus       (iii) Dictyota\n(c)  Red algae     (i)  Porphyra    (ii) Polysiphonia\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n32 BIOLOGY\n\nAlgae are useful to man in a variety of ways. At least a half of the total\n\ncarbon dioxide fixation on earth is carried out by algae through\n\nphotosynthesis. Being photosynthetic they increase the level of dissolved\n\noxygen in their immediate environment. They are of paramount\n\nimportance as primary producers of energy-rich compounds which form\n\nthe basis of the food cycles of all aquatic animals. Many species of Porphyra,\n\nLaminaria and Sargassum  are among the 70 species of marine algae\n\nused as food. Certain marine brown and red algae produce large amounts\n\nof hydrocolloids (water holding substances), e.g., algin (brown algae) and\n\ncarrageen (red algae) which are used commercially. Agar, one of the\n\ncommercial products obtained from Gelidium and Gracilaria are used to\n\ngrow microbes and in preparations of ice-creams and jellies. Chlorella a\n\nunicellular alga rich in proteins is used as food supplement even by space\n\ntravellers. The algae are divided into three main classes: Chlorophyceae,\n\nPhaeophyceae and Rhodophyceae.\n\n3.1.1 Chlorophyceae\n\nThe members of chlorophyceae are commonly called green algae. The\n\nplant body may be unicellular, colonial or filamentous. They are usually\n\ngrass green due to the dominance of pigments chlorophyll a and b. The\n\npigments are localised in definite chloroplasts. The chloroplasts may be\n\ndiscoid, plate-like, reticulate, cup-shaped, spiral or ribbon-shaped in\n\ndifferent species. Most of the members have one or more storage bodies\n\ncalled pyrenoids located in the chloroplasts. Pyrenoids contain protein\n\nbesides starch. Some algae may store food in the form of oil droplets.\n\nGreen algae usually have a rigid cell wall made of an inner layer of cellulose\n\nand an outer layer of pectose.\n\nVegetative reproduction usually takes place by fragmentation or by\n\nformation of different types of spores. Asexual reproduction is by\n\nflagellated zoospores produced in zoosporangia. The sexual reproduction\n\nshows considerable variation in the type and formation of sex cells and it\n\nmay be isogamous, anisogamous or oogamous. Some commonly found\n\ngreen algae are: Chlamydomonas, Volvox, Ulothrix, Spirogyra and Chara\n\n(Figure 3.1a).\n\n3.1.2 Phaeophyceae\n\nThe members of phaeophyceae or brown algae are found primarily in\n\nmarine habitats. They show great variation in size and form. They range\n\nfrom simple branched, filamentous forms (Ectocarpus) to profusely\n\nbranched forms as represented by kelps, which may reach a height of\n\n100 metres. They possess chlorophyll a, c, carotenoids and xanthophylls.\n\nThey vary in colour from olive green to various shades of brown depending\n\nupon the amount of the xanthophyll pigment, fucoxanthin present in\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPLANT KINGDOM 33\n\nthem. Food is stored as complex carbohydrates, which may be in the\n\nform of laminarin or mannitol. The vegetative cells have a cellulosic wall\n\nusually covered on the outside by a gelatinous coating of algin. The\n\nprotoplast contains, in addition to plastids, a centrally located vacuole\n\nand nucleus. The plant body is usually attached to the substratum by a\n\nholdfast, and has a stalk, the stipe and leaf like photosynthetic organ –\n\nthe frond. Vegetative reproduction takes place by fragmentation. Asexual\n\nreproduction in most brown algae is by biflagellate zoospores that are\n\npear-shaped and have two unequal laterally attached flagella.\n\nSexual reproduction may be isogamous, anisogamous or oogamous.\n\nUnion of gametes may take place in water or within the oogonium\n\n(oogamous species). The gametes are pyriform (pear-shaped) and bear\n\ntwo laterally attached flagella. The common forms are Ectocarpus, Dictyota,\n\nLaminaria, Sargassum and Fucus (Figure 3.1b).\n\n3.1.3 Rhodophyceae\n\nThe members of rhodophyceae are commonly called red algae because of\n\nthe predominance of the red pigment, r-phycoerythrin in their body. Majority\n\nof the red algae are marine with greater concentrations found in the warmer\n\nareas. They occur in both well-lighted regions close to the surface of water\n\nand also at great depths in oceans where relatively little light penetrates.\n\nThe red thalli of most of the red algae are  multicellular. Some of them\n\nhave complex body organisation. The food is stored as floridean starch\n\nwhich is very similar to amylopectin and glycogen in structure.\n\nThe red algae usually reproduce vegetatively by fragmentation. They\n\nreproduce asexually by non-motile spores and sexually by non-motile\n\nTABLE 3.1 Divisions of Algae and their Main Characteristics\n\nClasses Common Major Stored Cell Wall Flagellar Habitat\nName Pigments Food Number and\n\nPosition of\nInsertions\n\nChlorophyceae Green Chlorophyll Starch Cellulose 2-8, equal, Fresh water,\nalgae a, b apical brackish water,\n\nsalt water\n\nPhaeophyceae Brown Chlorophyll Mannitol, Cellulose 2, unequal, Fresh water\nalgae a, c, laminarin and algin lateral (rare) brackish\n\nfucoxanthin water, salt\nwater\n\nRhodophyceae Red Chlorophyll Floridean Cellulose, Absent Fresh water\nalgae a, d, starch pectin and (some),\n\nphycoerythrin poly brackish\nsulphate water, salt\nesters water (most)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n34 BIOLOGY\n\ngametes.

They usually occur in damp, humid and shaded localities.\n\nThey play an important role in plant succession on bare rocks/soil.\n\nThe plant body of bryophytes is more differentiated than that of algae.\n\nIt is thallus-like and prostrate or erect, and attached to the substratum\n\nby unicellular or multicellular rhizoids. They lack true roots, stem or\n\nleaves. They may possess root-like, leaf-like or stem-like structures. The\n\nmain plant body of the bryophyte is haploid. It produces gametes, hence\n\nis called a gametophyte. The sex organs in bryophytes are multicellular.\n\nThe male sex organ is called antheridium. They produce biflagellate\n\nantherozoids. The female sex organ called archegonium is flask-shaped\n\nand produces a single egg. The antherozoids are released into water where\n\nthey come in contact with archegonium. An antherozoid fuses with the\n\negg to produce the zygote. Zygotes do not undergo reduction division\n\nimmediately. They produce a multicellular body called a sporophyte.\n\nThe sporophyte is not free-living but attached to the photosynthetic\n\ngametophyte and derives nourishment from it. Some cells of the\n\nsporophyte undergo reduction division (meiosis) to produce haploid\n\nspores.  These spores germinate to produce gametophyte.\n\nBryophytes in general are of little economic importance but some\n\nmosses provide food for herbaceous mammals, birds and other animals.\n\nSpecies of Sphagnum, a moss, provide peat that have long been used as\n\nfuel,  and as packing material for trans-shipment of living material because\n\nof their capacity to hold water. Mosses along with lichens are the first\n\norganisms to colonise rocks and hence, are of great ecological importance.\n\nThey decompose rocks making the substrate suitable for the growth of\n\nhigher plants. Since mosses form dense mats on the soil, they reduce the\n\nimpact of falling rain and prevent soil erosion. The bryophytes are divided\n\ninto liverworts and mosses.\n\n3.2.1 Liverworts\n\nThe liverworts grow usually in moist, shady habitats such as banks of\n\nstreams, marshy ground, damp soil, bark of trees and deep in the woods.\n\nThe plant body of a liverwort is thalloid, e.g., Marchantia. The thallus is\n\ndorsiventral and closely appressed to the substrate. The leafy members\n\nhave tiny leaf-like appendages in two rows on the stem-like structures.\n\nAsexual reproduction in liverworts takes place by fragmentation of\n\nthalli, or by the formation of specialised structures called gemmae\n\n(sing. gemma). Gemmae are green, multicellular, asexual buds, which\n\ndevelop in small receptacles  called gemma cups located on the thalli.\n\nThe gemmae become detached from the parent body and germinate to\n\nform new individuals. During sexual reproduction, male and female sex\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n36 BIOLOGY\n\norgans are produced either on the same or on different thalli. The\n\nsporophyte is differentiated into a foot, seta and capsule. After meiosis,\n\nspores are produced within the capsule. These spores germinate to form\n\nfree-living gametophytes.\n\n3.2.2 Mosses\n\nThe predominant stage of the life cycle of a moss is the gametophyte which\n\nconsists of two stages. The first stage is the protonema stage, which\n\ndevelops directly from a spore. It is a creeping, green, branched and\n\nfrequently filamentous stage. The second stage is the leafy stage, which\n\ndevelops from the secondary protonema as a lateral bud. They consist of\n\nupright, slender axes bearing spirally arranged leaves. They are attached\n\nto the soil through multicellular and branched rhizoids. This stage bears\n\nthe sex organs.\n\nVegetative reproduction in mosses is by fragmentation and budding\n\nin the secondary protonema. In sexual reproduction, the sex organs\n\nantheridia and archegonia are produced at the apex of the leafy shoots.\n\nAfter fertilisation, the zygote develops into a sporophyte, consisting of a\n\nfoot, seta and capsule. The sporophyte in mosses is more elaborate than\n\nthat in liverworts. The capsule contains spores. Spores are formed after\n\nmeiosis. The mosses have an elaborate mechanism of spore dispersal.\n\nCommon examples of mosses are Funaria, Polytrichum and Sphagnum\n\n(Figure 3.2).\n\n3.3 PTERIDOPHYTES\n\nThe Pteridophytes include horsetails and ferns. Pteridophytes are used\n\nfor medicinal purposes and as soil-binders. They are also frequently grown\n\nas ornamentals. Evolutionarily, they are the first terrestrial plants to\n\npossess vascular tissues – xylem and phloem. You shall study more about\n\nthese tissues in Chapter 6. The pteridophytes are found in cool, damp,\n\nshady places though some may flourish well in sandy-soil conditions.\n\nYou may recall that in bryophytes the dominant phase in the life\n\ncycle is the gametophytic plant body. However, in pteridophytes, the\n\nmain plant body is a sporophyte which is differentiated into true root,\n\nstem and leaves (Figure 3.3). These organs possess well-differentiated\n\nvascular tissues. The leaves in pteridophyta are small (microphylls) as\n\nin Selaginella or large (macrophylls) as in ferns. The sporophytes bear\n\nsporangia that are subtended by leaf-like appendages called\n\nsporophylls. In some cases sporophylls may form distinct compact\n\nstructures called strobili or cones (Selaginella, Equisetum). The\n\nsporangia produce spores by meiosis in spore mother cells. The spores\n\ngerminate to give rise to inconspicuous, small but multicellular,\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPLANT KINGDOM 37\n\nFigure 3.3  Pteridophytes :  (a) Selaginella  (b) Equisetum  (c) Fern (d) Salvinia\n\nStrobilus\n\nNode\n\nInternode\n\nBranch\n\nRhizome\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n(d)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n38 BIOLOGY\n\nfree-living, mostly photosynthetic thalloid gametophytes called\n\nprothallus. These gametophytes require cool, damp, shady places to\n\ngrow. Because of this specific restricted requirement and the need for\n\nwater for fertilisation, the spread of living pteridophytes is limited and\n\nrestricted to narrow geographical regions. The gametophytes bear male\n\nand female sex organs called antheridia and archegonia, respectively.\n\nWater is required for transfer of antherozoids – the male gametes released\n\nfrom the antheridia, to the mouth of archegonium. Fusion of male gamete\n\nwith the egg present in the archegonium result in the formation of zygote.\n\nZygote thereafter produces a multicellular well-differentiated sporophyte\n\nwhich is the dominant phase of the pteridophytes. In majority of the\n\npteridophytes all the spores are of similar kinds; such plants are called\n\nhomosporous. Genera like Selaginella and Salvinia which produce\n\ntwo kinds of spores, macro (large) and micro (small) spores, are known\n\nas heterosporous. The megaspores and microspores germinate and give\n\nrise to female and male gametophytes, respectively. The female\n\ngametophytes in these plants are retained on the parent sporophytes\n\nfor variable periods. The development of the zygotes into young embryos\n\ntake place within the female gametophytes. This event is a precursor to\n\nthe seed habit considered an important step in evolution.\n\nThe pteridophytes are further classified into four classes: Psilopsida\n\n(Psilotum); Lycopsida (Selaginella, Lycopodium), Sphenopsida (Equisetum)\n\nand Pteropsida (Dryopteris, Pteris, Adiantum).\n\n3.4 GYMNOSPERMS\n\nThe gymnosperms (gymnos : naked, sperma : seeds) are plants in which\n\nthe ovules are not enclosed by any ovary wall and remain exposed, both\n\nbefore and after fertilisation. The seeds that develop post-fertilisation, are\n\nnot covered, i.e., are naked. Gymnosperms include medium-sized trees\n\nor tall trees and shrubs (Figure 3.4). One of the gymnosperms, the giant\n\nredwood tree Sequoia is one of the tallest tree species. The roots are\n\ngenerally tap roots. Roots in some genera have fungal association in the\n\nform of mycorrhiza (Pinus), while in some others (Cycas) small specialised\n\nroots called coralloid roots are associated with N\n2\n- fixing cyanobacteria.\n\nThe stems are unbranched (Cycas) or branched (Pinus, Cedrus). The leaves\n\nmay be simple or compound. In Cycas the pinnate leaves persist for a few\n\nyears. The leaves in gymnosperms are well-adapted to withstand extremes\n\nof temperature, humidity and wind. In conifers, the needle-like leaves\n\nreduce the surface area. Their thick cuticle and sunken stomata also\n\nhelp to reduce water loss.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPLANT KINGDOM 39\n\nThe gymnosperms are heterosporous; they produce\n\nhaploid microspores and megaspores. The two kinds of\n\nspores are produced within sporangia that are borne\n\non sporophylls which are arranged spirally along an axis\n\nto form lax or compact strobili or cones. The strobili\n\nbearing microsporophylls and microsporangia are\n\ncalled microsporangiate or male strobili. The\n\nmicrospores develop into a male gametophytic\n\ngeneration which is highly reduced and is confined to\n\nonly a limited number of cells. This reduced\n\ngametophyte is called a pollen grain. The development\n\nof pollen grains take place within the microsporangia.\n\nThe cones bearing megasporophylls with ovules or\n\nmegasporangia are called macrosporangiate or female\n\nstrobili. The male or female cones or strobili may be\n\nborne on the same tree (Pinus). However, in cycas male\n\ncones and megasporophylls are borne on different trees.\n\nThe megaspore mother cell is differentiated from one of\n\nthe cells of the nucellus. The nucellus is protected by\n\nenvelopes and the composite structure is called an\n\novule. The ovules are borne on megasporophylls which\n\nmay be clustered to form the female cones. The\n\nmegaspore mother cell divides meiotically to form four\n\nmegaspores. One of the megaspores enclosed within the\n\nmegasporangium develops into a multicellular  female\n\ngametophyte that bears two or more archegonia or\n\nfemale sex organs. The multicellular female gametophyte\n\nis also retained within megasporangium.\n\nUnlike bryophytes and pteridophytes, in\n\ngymnosperms the male and the female gametophytes\n\ndo not have an independent free-living existence. They\n\nremain within the sporangia retained on the\n\nsporophytes. The pollen grain is released from the\n\nmicrosporangium. They are carried in air currents and\n\ncome in contact with the opening of the ovules borne\n\non megasporophylls. The pollen tube carrying the\n\nmale gametes grows towards archegonia in the ovules\n\nand discharge their contents near the mouth of the\n\narchegonia. Following fertilisation, zygote develops\n\ninto an embryo and the ovules into seeds. These seeds\n\nare not covered.\n(c)\n\nFigure 3.4 Gymnosperms: (a) Cycas\n(b) Pinus (c) Ginkgo\n\nDwarf Shoot\n\nLong Shoot\n\nSeeds\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n40 BIOLOGY\n\n3.5 ANGIOSPERMS\n\nUnlike the gymnosperms where the ovules are naked, in the angiosperms\n\nor flowering plants, the pollen grains and ovules are developed in\n\nspecialised structures called flowers. In angiosperms, the seeds are\n\nenclosed in fruits. The angiosperms are an exceptionally large group of\n\nplants occurring in wide range of habitats. They range in size from the\n\nsmallest Wolffia to tall trees of Eucalyptus (over 100 metres). They provide\n\nus with food, fodder,  fuel, medicines and several other commercially\n\nimportant products. They are divided into two classes : the dicotyledons\n\nand the monocotyledons (Figure 3.5). The dicotyledons are\n\ncharacterised by seeds having two cotyledons, reticulate venations in\n\nleaves, and tetramerous or pentamerous flowers, i.e., having four or five\n\nmembers in each floral whorls. The monocotyledons on the other hand\n\nare characterised by single cotyledonous seeds, parallel venation in\n\nleaves, and trimerous flowers having three members in each floral whorls.\n\nThe male sex organ in a flower is the stamen. Each stamen consists of a\n\nslender filament with an anther at the tip. Within the anthers, the pollen\n\nmother cell divide by meiosis to produce microspores which matures\n\ninto pollen grains. The female sex organ in a flower is the pistil. Pistil\n\nconsists of a swollen ovary at its base, a long slender style and stigma.\n\nInside the ovary, ovules are present. Generally each ovule has a\n\nmegaspore mother cell that undergoes meiosis to form four haploid\n\nmegaspores. Three of them degenerate and one divide to form the embryo\n\nsac. Each embryo-sac has a three-celled egg apparatus – one egg cell\n\nand two synergids, three antipodal cells and two polar nuclei. The polar\n\n(b)(a)\n\nFigure 3.5 Angiosperms : (a) A dicotyledon (b) A monocotyledon\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPLANT KINGDOM 41\n\nFigure 3.6  Life cycle of an angiosperm\n\nnuclei eventually fuse to produce a diploid secondary nucleus. Pollen\n\ngrain, after dispersal from the anthers, are carried by wind or various other\n\nagencies to the stigma of a pistil. This is termed as pollination. The pollen\n\ngrains germinate on the stigma and the resulting pollen tubes grow through\n\nthe tissues of stigma and style and reach the ovule. The pollen tubes enter\n\nthe embryo-sac where two male gametes are discharged. One of the male\n\ngametes fuses with the egg cell (syngamy) to form a zygote. The other male\n\ngamete fuses with the diploid secondary nucleus to produce the triploid\n\nprimary endosperm nucleus (PEN). Because of the occurrence of two\n\nfusions i.e., syngamy and triple fusion, this event is termed as double\n\nfertilisation, an event unique to angiosperms. The zygote develops into\n\nan embryo (with one or two cotyledons) and the PEN develops into\n\nendosperm which provides nourishment to  the developing embryo. The\n\nsynergids and antipodals degenerate after fertilisation. During these events\n\nthe ovules develop into seeds and the ovaries develop into fruit. The life\n\ncycle of an angiosperm is shown in Figure 3.6.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n42 BIOLOGY\n\n3.6  PLANT LIFE CYCLES AND ALTERNATION OF\nGENERATIONS\n\nIn plants, both haploid and diploid cells can divide by\n\nmitosis. This ability leads to the formation of different\n\nplant  bodies - haploid and diploid. The haploid plant\n\nbody produces gametes by mitosis. This plant body\n\nrepresents a gametophyte. Following fertilisation the\n\nzygote also divides by mitosis to produce a diploid\n\nsporophytic plant body. Haploid spores are produced\n\nby this plant body by meiosis. These in turn, divide by\n\nmitosis to form a haploid plant body once again. Thus,\n\nduring the life cycle of any sexually reproducing plant,\n\nthere is an alternation of generations between gamete\n\nproducing haploid gametophyte and spore producing\n\ndiploid sporophyte.\n\nHowever, different plant groups, as well as individuals\n\nrepresenting them, differ in the following patterns:\n\n1. Sporophytic generation is represented only by the\n\none-celled zygote. There are no free-living\n\nsporophytes. Meiosis in the zygote results in the\n\nformation of haploid spores. The haploid spores\n\ndivide mitotically and form the gametophyte. The\n\ndominant, photosynthetic phase in such plants is\n\nthe free-living gametophyte. This kind of life cycle\n\nis termed as haplontic. Many algae such as Volvox,\n\nSpirogyra and some species of Chlamydomonas\n\nrepresent this pattern (Figure 3.7 a).\n\n2. On the other extreme, is the type wherein the diploid\n\nsporophyte is the dominant, photosynthetic,\n\nindependent phase of the plant. The gametophytic\n\nphase is represented by the single to few-celled\n\nhaploid gametophyte. This kind of life cycle is\n\ntermed as diplontic. An alga, Fucus sp., represents\n\nthis pattern (Fig. 3.7b). In addition, all seed bearing\n\nplants i.e., gymnosperms and angiosperms, follow\n\nthis pattern with some variations, wherein, the\n\ngametophytic phase is few to multi-celled.\n\n3. Bryophytes and pteridophytes, interestingly, exhibit\n\nan intermediate condition (Haplo-diplontic); both\n\nphases are multicellular. However, they differ in their\n\ndominant phases.\n\nSyngam\ny\n\nZygote\n(2n)\n\nSpores\n(n)\n\nHaplontic\n\nA\n\nB\nGametogenesis\n\nMeiosis\n\nGametophyte\n(n)\n\n(a)\n\nB\n\nA\n\nHaplo-diplontic\nSpores\n\n(n)\n\nMeiosis\n\nGametophyte\n(n)\n\nSyngamy\n\nZygote\n(2n)\n\nGametogenesis\n\nSporophyte\n(2n)\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 3.7 Life cycle patterns : (a) Haplontic\n(b) Diplontic  (c) Haplo-diplontic\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPLANT KINGDOM 43\n\nSUMMARY\n\nPlant kingdom includes algae, bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms and\n\nangiosperms. Algae are chlorophyll-bearing simple, thalloid, autotrophic and\n\nlargely aquatic organisms. Depending on the type of pigment possesed and the\n\ntype of stored food, algae are classfied into three classes, namely Chlorophyceae,\n\nPhaeophyceae and Rhodophyceae. Algae usually reproduce vegetatively by\n\nfragmentation, asexually by formation of different types of spores and sexually by\n\nformation of gametes which may show isogamy, anisogamy or oogamy.\n\nBryophytes are plants which can live in soil but are dependent on water for\n\nsexual reproduction. Their plant body is more differentiated than that of algae. It\n\nis thallus-like and prostrate or erect and attached to the substratum by rhizoids.\n\nThey possess root-like, leaf-like and stem-like structures. The bryophytes are\n\ndivided into liverworts and mosses. The plant body of liverworts is thalloid and\n\ndorsiventral whereas mosses have upright, slender axes bearing spirally arranged\n\nleaves. The main plant body of a bryophyte is gamete-producing and is called a\n\ngametophyte. It bears the male sex organs called antheridia  and female sex organs\n\ncalled archegonia. The male and female gametes produced fuse to form zygote\n\nwhich produces a multicellular body called a sporophyte. It produces haploid\n\nspores. The spores germinate to form gametophytes.\n\nIn pteridophytes the main plant is a sporophyte which is differentiated into\n\ntrue root, stem and leaves. These organs possess well-differentiated vascular\n\ntissues. The sporophytes bear sporangia which produce spores. The spores\n\ngerminate to form  gametophytes which require cool, damp places to grow. The\n\ngametophytes bear male and female sex organs called antheridia and archegonia,\n\nrespectively. Water is required for transfer of male gametes to archegonium where\n\nzygote is formed after fertilisation. The zygote produces a sporophyte.\n\nA dominant, independent, photosynthetic, thalloid or erect phase is\n\nrepresented by a haploid gametophyte and it alternates with the short-\n\nlived multicelluler sporophyte totally or partially dependent on the\n\ngametophyte for its anchorage and nutrition. All bryophytes represent\n\nthis pattern.\n\nThe diploid sporophyte is represented by a dominant, independent,\n\nphotosynthetic, vascular plant body. It alternates with multicellular,\n\nsaprophytic/autotrophic, independent but short-lived haploid\n\ngametophyte. Such a pattern is known as haplo-diplontic life cycle. All\n\npteridophytes exhibit this pattern (Figure 3.7 c).\n\nInterestingly, while most algal genera are haplontic, some of them\n\nsuch as Ectocarpus, Polysiphonia, kelps are haplo-diplontic. Fucus, an\n\nalga is diplontic.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n44 BIOLOGY\n\nThe gymnosperms are the plants in which ovules are not enclosed by any\n\novary wall. After fertilisation the seeds remain exposed and therefore these plants\n\nare called naked-seeded plants. The gymnosperms produce microspores and\n\nmegaspores which are produced in microsporangia and megasporangia borne on\n\nthe sporophylls. The sporophylls – microsporophylls and megasporophylls – are\n\narranged spirally on axis to form male and female cones, respectively. The pollen\n\ngrain germinates and pollen tube releases the male gamete into the ovule, where it\n\nfuses with the egg cell in archegonia. Following fertilisation, the zygote develops\n\ninto embryo and the ovules into seeds.\n\nIn angiosperms, the male sex organs (stamen) and female sex organs (pistil)\n\nare borne in a flower. Each stamen consists of a filament and an anther. The anther\n\nproduces pollen grains (male gametophyte) after meiosis. The pistil consists of an\n\novary enclosing one to many ovules. Within the ovule is the female gametophyte\n\nor embryo sac which contains the egg cell. The pollen tube enters the embryo-sac\n\nwhere two male gametes are discharged. One male gamete fuses with egg cell\n\n(syngamy) and other fuses with diploid secondary nucleus (triple fusion). This\n\nphenomenon of two fusions is called double fertilisation and is unique to\n\nangiosperms. The angiosperms are divided into two classes – the dicotyledons\n\nand the monocotyledons.\n\nDuring the life cycle of any sexually reproducing plant, there is alternation of\n\ngenerations between gamete producing haploid gametophyte and spore producing\n\ndiploid sporophyte. However, different plant groups as well as individuals may\n\nshow different patterns of life cycles – haplontic, diplontic or intermediate.\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1.
