The night sky with its bright celestial objects has\nfascinated humans since time immemorial. The regular\nrepetitions of the day and night, the annual cycle of seasons,\nthe eclipses, the tides, the volcanoes, the rainbow have always\nbeen a source of wonder. The world has an astonishing variety\nof materials and a bewildering diversity of life and behaviour.\nThe inquiring and imaginative human mind has responded\nto the wonder and awe of nature in different ways. One kind\nof response from the earliest times has been to observe the\nphysical environment carefully, look for any meaningful\npatterns and relations in natural phenomena, and build and\nuse new tools to interact with nature.  This human endeavour\nled, in course of time, to modern science and technology.\n\nThe word Science originates from the Latin verb Scientia\nmeaning ‘to know’.  The Sanskrit word Vijñãn and the Arabic\nword Ilm convey similar meaning, namely ‘knowledge’.\nScience, in a broad sense, is as old as human species. The\nearly civilisations of Egypt, India, China, Greece, Mesopotamia\nand many others made vital contributions to its progress.\nFrom the sixteenth century onwards, great strides were made\nin science in Europe. By the middle of the twentieth century,\nscience had become a truly international enterprise, with\nmany cultures and countries contributing to its rapid growth.\n\nWhat is Science and what is the so-called Scientific\nMethod?  Science is a systematic attempt to understand\nnatural phenomena in as much detail and depth as possible,\nand use the knowledge so gained to predict, modify and\ncontrol phenomena. Science is exploring, experimenting and\npredicting from what we see around us. The curiosity to learn\nabout the world, unravelling the secrets of nature is the first\nstep towards the discovery of science. The scientific method\ninvolves several interconnected steps : Systematic\nobservations, controlled experiments, qualitative and\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nPHYSICAL WORLD\n\n1.1 What is physics ?\n\n1.2 Scope and excitement of\nphysics\n\n1.3 Physics, technology and\nsociety\n\n1.4 Fundamental forces in\nnature\n\n1.5 Nature of physical laws\n\nSummary\n\nExercises\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS2\n\nquantitative reasoning, mathematical\nmodelling, prediction and verification or\nfalsification of theories. Speculation and\nconjecture also have a place in science; but\nultimately, a scientific theory, to be acceptable,\nmust be verified by relevant observations  or\nexperiments. There is much philosophical\ndebate about the nature and method of science\nthat we need not discuss here.\n\nThe interplay of theory and observation (or\nexperiment) is basic to the progress of science.\nScience is ever dynamic. There is no ‘final’\ntheory in science and no unquestioned\nauthority among scientists.  As observations\nimprove in detail and precision or experiments\nyield new results, theories must account for\nthem, if necessary, by introducing modifications.\nSometimes the modifications may not be drastic\nand may lie within the framework of existing\ntheory.  For example, when Johannes Kepler\n(1571-1630) examined the extensive data on\nplanetary motion collected by Tycho Brahe\n(1546-1601), the planetary circular orbits in\nheliocentric  theory (sun at the centre of the\nsolar system) imagined by Nicolas Copernicus\n(1473–1543) had to be replaced by elliptical\norbits to fit the data better.  Occasionally,\nhowever, the  existing theory is simply unable\nto explain new observations.  This causes a\nmajor upheaval in science. In the beginning of\nthe twentieth century, it was realised that\nNewtonian mechanics, till then a very\nsuccessful theory, could not explain some of the\nmost basic features of atomic phenomena.\nSimilarly, the then accepted wave picture of light\nfailed to explain the photoelectric effect properly.\nThis led to the development of a  radically new\ntheory (Quantum Mechanics) to deal with atomic\nand molecular phenomena.\n\nJust as a new experiment may suggest an\nalternative theoretical model, a theoretical\nadvance may suggest what to look for in some\nexperiments.  The result of experiment of\nscattering of alpha particles by gold foil, in 1911\nby Ernest Rutherford (1871–1937) established\nthe nuclear model of the atom, which then\nbecame the basis of the quantum theory of\nhydrogen atom given in 1913 by Niels Bohr\n(1885–1962). On the other hand, the concept of\nantiparticle was first introduced theoretically by\nPaul Dirac (1902–1984) in 1930 and confirmed\ntwo years later by the experimental discovery of\npositron (antielectron) by Carl Anderson.\n\nPhysics is a basic discipline in the category\n\nof Natural Sciences, which also includes other\ndisciplines like Chemistry and Biology. The word\n\nPhysics comes from a Greek word meaning\nnature. Its Sanskrit equivalent is Bhautiki that\nis used to refer to the study of the physical world.\n\nA precise definition of this discipline is neither\npossible nor necessary.  We can broadly describe\n\nphysics as a study of the basic laws of  nature\nand their manifestation in different natural\n\nphenomena.  The scope of physics is described\nbriefly in the next section.  Here we remark on\ntwo principal thrusts in physics :  unification\nand reduction.\n\nIn Physics, we attempt to explain diverse\n\nphysical phenomena in terms of a few concepts\nand laws.  The effort is to see the physical world\nas manifestation of some universal laws in\n\ndifferent domains and conditions.  For example,\nthe same law of gravitation (given by Newton)\n\ndescribes the fall of an apple to the ground, the\nmotion of the moon around the earth and the\n\nmotion of planets around the sun. Similarly, the\nbasic laws of electromagnetism (Maxwell’s\nequations) govern all electric and magnetic\n\nphenomena. The attempts to unify fundamental\nforces of nature (section 1.4) reflect this same\n\nquest for unification.\nA related effort is to derive the properties of a\n\nbigger, more complex, system from the properties\n\nand interactions of its constituent simpler parts.\nThis approach is called reductionism and is\nat the heart of physics.  For example, the subject\nof thermodynamics, developed in the nineteenth\ncentury, deals with bulk systems in terms of\n\nmacroscopic quantities such as temperature,\ninternal energy, entropy, etc.  Subsequently, the\n\nsubjects of kinetic theory and statistical\nmechanics interpreted these quantities in terms\n\nof the properties of the molecular constituents\nof the bulk system.  In particular, the\ntemperature was seen to be related to the average\n\nkinetic energy of molecules  of the system.\n\n1.2  SCOPE AND EXCITEMENT OF PHYSICS\n\nWe can get some idea of the scope of physics by\nlooking at its various sub-disciplines.  Basically,\nthere are two domains of interest : macroscopic\nand microscopic. The macroscopic domain\nincludes phenomena at the laboratory, terrestrial\nand astronomical scales. The microscopic domain\nincludes atomic, molecular and nuclear\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICAL WORLD 3\n\nAmpere and Faraday, and encapsulated by\nMaxwell in his famous set of equations. The\nmotion of a current-carrying conductor in a\nmagnetic field, the response of a circuit to an ac\nvoltage (signal), the working of an antenna, the\npropagation of radio waves in the ionosphere, etc.,\nare problems of electrodynamics. Optics deals\nwith the phenomena involving light. The working\nof telescopes and microscopes, colours exhibited\nby thin films, etc., are topics in optics.\nThermodynamics, in contrast to mechanics, does\nnot deal with the motion of bodies as a whole.\nRather, it deals with systems in macroscopic\nequilibrium and is concerned with changes in\ninternal energy, temperature, entropy, etc., of the\nsystem through external work and transfer of\nheat.  The efficiency of heat engines and\nrefrigerators, the direction of a physical or\n\nYou can now see that the scope of physics is\n\ntruly vast.  It covers a tremendous range of\n\nmagnitude of physical quantities like length,\n\nmass, time, energy, etc.  At one end, it studies\n\nphenomena at the very small scale of length\n\n(10\n-14 \n\nm or even less) involving electrons, protons,\n\netc.; at the other end, it deals with astronomical\n\nphenomena at the scale of galaxies or even the\n\nentire universe whose extent is of the order of\n\n10\n26 \n\nm.  The two length scales differ by a factor of\n\n10\n40\n\n or even more.  The range of time scales can\n\nbe obtained by dividing the length scales by the\n\nspeed of light : 10\n–22 \n\ns to 1018\n \ns.  The range of\n\nmasses goes from, say, 10–30 kg  (mass of an\n\nelectron) to 10\n55 \n\nkg (mass of known observable\n\nuniverse). Terrestrial phenomena lie somewhere\n\nin the middle of this range.\n\nFig. 1.1 Theory and experiment go hand in hand in physics and help each other’s progress. The alpha scattering\nexperiments of Rutherford gave the nuclear model of the atom.\n\n* Recently, the domain intermediate between the macroscopic and the microscopic (the so-called mesoscopic\nphysics), dealing with a few tens or hundreds of atoms, has emerged as an exciting  field of  research.\n\nphenomena*. Classical Physics deals mainly\nwith macroscopic phenomena and includes\nsubjects like Mechanics, Electrodynamics,\nOptics and Thermodynamics. Mechanics\nfounded on Newton’s laws of motion and the law\nof gravitation is concerned with the motion (or\nequilibrium) of particles, rigid and deformable\nbodies, and general systems of particles.  The\npropulsion of a rocket by a jet of ejecting gases,\npropagation of water waves or sound waves in\nair, the equilibrium of a bent rod under a load,\netc., are problems of mechanics.  Electrodynamics\ndeals with electric and magnetic phenomena\nassociated with charged and magnetic bodies.\nIts basic laws were given by Coulomb, Oersted,\n\nchemical process, etc., are problems of interest\n\nin thermodynamics.\n\nThe microscopic domain of physics deals  with\n\nthe constitution and structure of matter at the\n\nminute scales of atoms and nuclei (and even\n\nlower scales of length) and their interaction with\n\ndifferent probes such as electrons, photons and\n\nother elementary particles. Classical physics is\n\ninadequate to handle this domain and Quantum\n\nTheory is currently accepted as the proper\n\nframework for explaining microscopic\n\nphenomena.  Overall, the edifice of physics is\n\nbeautiful and imposing and you will appreciate\n\nit more as you pursue the subject.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS4\n\nPhysics is exciting in many ways. To some people\nthe excitement comes from the elegance and\nuniversality of its basic theories, from the fact that\na few basic concepts and laws can explain\nphenomena covering a large range of magnitude\nof physical quantities. To some others, the challenge\nin carrying out imaginative new experiments to\nunlock the secrets of nature, to verify or refute\ntheories, is thrilling.  Applied physics is equally\ndemanding. Application and exploitation of\nphysical laws to make useful devices is the most\ninteresting and exciting part and requires great\ningenuity and persistence of effort.\n\nWhat lies behind the phenomenal progress\nof physics in the last few centuries? Great\nprogress usually accompanies changes in our\nbasic perceptions.  First, it was realised that for\nscientific progress, only qualitative thinking,\nthough no doubt important, is not enough.\nQuantitative measurement is central to the\ngrowth of science, especially physics, because\nthe laws of nature happen to be expressible in\nprecise mathematical equations. The second\nmost important insight was that the basic laws\nof physics are universal — the same laws apply\nin widely different contexts. Lastly, the strategy\nof approximation turned out to be very\nsuccessful.  Most observed phenomena in daily\nlife are rather complicated manifestations of the\nbasic laws. Scientists recognised the importance\nof extracting the essential features of a\nphenomenon from its less significant aspects.\nIt is not practical to take into account all the\ncomplexities of a phenomenon in one go.  A good\nstrategy is to focus first on the essential features,\ndiscover the basic principles and then introduce\ncorrections to build a more refined theory of the\nphenomenon. For example, a stone and a feather\ndropped from the same height do not reach the\nground at the same time. The reason is that the\nessential aspect of the phenomenon, namely free\nfall under gravity, is complicated by the\npresence of air resistance. To get the law of free\nfall under gravity, it is better to create a\nsituation wherein the air resistance is\nnegligible. We can, for example, let the stone and\nthe feather fall through a long evacuated tube.\nIn that case, the two objects will fall almost at\nthe same rate, giving the basic law that\nacceleration due to gravity is independent of the\nmass of the object.  With the basic law thus\nfound, we can go back to the feather, introduce\ncorrections due to air resistance, modify the\nexisting theory and try to build a more realistic\n\nHypothesis, axioms and models\n\nOne should not think that everything can be proved\nwith physics and mathematics. All physics, and also\nmathematics, is based on assumptions, each of\nwhich is variously called a hypothesis or axiom or\npostulate, etc.\n\nFor example, the universal law of gravitation\nproposed by Newton is an assumption or hypothesis,\nwhich he proposed out of his ingenuity. Before him,\nthere were several observations, experiments and\ndata, on the motion of planets around the sun,\nmotion of the moon around the earth, pendulums,\nbodies falling towards the earth etc. Each of these\nrequired a separate explanation, which was more\nor less qualitative. What the universal law of\ngravitation says is that, if we assume that any two\nbodies in the universe attract each other with a\nforce proportional to the product of their masses\nand inversely proportional to the square of the\ndistance between them, then we can explain all\nthese observations in one stroke. It not only explains\nthese phenomena, it also allows us to predict the\nresults of future experiments.\n\nA hypothesis is a supposition without assuming\nthat it is true. It would not be fair to ask anybody\nto prove the universal law of gravitation, because\nit cannot be proved. It can be verified and\nsubstantiated by experiments and observations.\n\nAn axiom is a self-evident truth while a model\nis a theory proposed to explain observed\nphenomena. But you need not worry at this stage\nabout the nuances in using these words. For\nexample, next year you will learn about Bohr’s model\nof hydrogen atom, in which Bohr assumed that an\nelectron in the hydrogen atom follows certain rules\n(postutates). Why did he do that? There was a large\namount of spectroscopic data before him which no\nother theory could explain. So Bohr said that if we\nassume that an atom behaves in such a manner,\nwe can explain all these things at once.\n\nEinstein’s special theory of relativity is also\nbased on two postulates, the constancy of the speed\nof electromagnetic radiation and the validity of\nphysical laws in all inertial frame of reference. It\nwould not be wise to ask somebody to prove that\nthe speed of light in vacuum is constant,\nindependent of the source or observer.\n\nIn mathematics too, we need axioms and\nhypotheses at every stage. Euclid’s statement that\nparallel lines never meet, is a hypothesis. This means\nthat if we assume this statement, we can explain\nseveral properties of straight lines and two or three\ndimensional figures made out of them. But if you\ndon’t assume it, you are free to use a different axiom\nand get a new geometry, as has indeed happened in\nthe past few centuries and decades.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICAL WORLD 5\n\nTable 1.1 Some physicists from different countries of the world and their major contributions\n\ntheory of objects falling to the earth under\ngravity.\n\n1.3  PHYSICS, TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIETY\n\nThe connection between physics, technology\nand society can be seen in many examples. The\ndiscipline of thermodynamics arose from the\nneed to understand and improve the working of\nheat engines.  The steam engine, as we know,\nis inseparable from the Industrial Revolution in\nEngland in the eighteenth century, which had\ngreat impact on the course of human\ncivilisation. Sometimes technology gives rise to\nnew physics; at other times physics generates\nnew technology. An example of the latter is the\nwireless communication technology that followed\nthe discovery of the basic laws of electricity and\nmagnetism in the nineteenth century. The\napplications of  physics are not always easy to\nforesee. As late as 1933, the great physicist\nErnest Rutherford had dismissed the possibility\nof tapping energy from atoms. But only a few\nyears later, in 1938, Hahn and Meitner\ndiscovered the phenomenon of neutron-induced\nfission of uranium, which would serve as the\nbasis of nuclear power reactors and nuclear\nweapons. Yet another important example of\nphysics giving rise to technology is the silicon\n‘chip’ that triggered  the computer revolution in\nthe last three decades of the twentieth century.\n\nA most significant area to which physics has\nand will contribute is the development of\nalternative energy resources.  The fossil fuels of\nthe planet are dwindling fast and there is an\nurgent need to discover new and affordable\nsources of energy.  Considerable progress has\nalready been made in this direction (for\nexample, in conversion of solar energy,\ngeothermal energy, etc., into electricity), but\nmuch more is still to be accomplished.\n\nTable1.1 lists some of the great physicists,\ntheir major contribution and the country of\norigin. You will appreciate from this table the\nmulti-cultural, international character of the\nscientific endeavour. Table 1.2 lists some\nimportant technologies and the principles of\nphysics  they  are  based on.  Obviously,  these\ntables are not exhaustive. We urge you to try to\nadd many names and items to these tables with\nthe help of your teachers, good books and\nwebsites on science.  You will find that this\nexercise is very educative and also great fun.\nAnd, assuredly, it will never end.

However, we\nadvise you to read them carefully to develop a feel for some basic aspects of  physics. These are some of the\n\nareas which continue to occupy the physicists today.\n\nof physical laws? We shall now discuss the\nnature of fundamental forces and the laws that\ngovern the diverse phenomena of the physical\nworld.\n\n1.4  FUNDAMENTAL FORCES IN NATURE*\n\nWe all have an intuitive notion of force. In our\nexperience, force is needed to push, carry or\nthrow objects, deform or break them.  We also\nexperience the impact of forces on us, like when\na moving object hits us or we are in a merry-go-\nround. Going from this intuitive notion to the\nproper scientific concept of force is not a trivial\nmatter. Early thinkers like Aristotle had wrong\n\nideas about it.  The correct notion of force was\narrived at by Isaac Newton in his famous laws of\nmotion. He also gave an explicit form for the force\nfor gravitational attraction between two bodies.\nWe shall learn these matters in subsequent\nchapters.\n\nIn the macroscopic world, besides the\ngravitational force, we encounter several kinds\nof forces: muscular force, contact forces between\nbodies, friction (which is also a contact force\nparallel to the surfaces in contact), the forces\nexerted by compressed or elongated springs and\ntaut strings and ropes (tension), the force of\nbuoyancy and viscous force when solids are in\n\nVictor Francis Hess Cosmic radiation Austria\n\nR.A.

There are also forces involving charged\nand magnetic bodies. In the microscopic domain\nagain, we have electric and magnetic forces,\nnuclear forces involving protons and neutrons,\ninteratomic and intermolecular forces, etc.  We\nshall get familiar with some of these forces in later\nparts of this course.\n\nA great insight of the twentieth century\nphysics is that these different forces occurring\nin different contexts actually arise from only a\nsmall number of fundamental forces in nature.\nFor example, the elastic spring force arises due\n\nto the net attraction/repulsion between the\nneighbouring atoms of the spring when the\nspring is elongated/compressed. This net\n\nattraction/repulsion can be traced to the\n(unbalanced) sum of electric forces between the\ncharged constituents of the atoms.\n\nIn principle, this means that the laws for\n‘derived’ forces (such as spring force, friction)\nare not independent of the laws of fundamental\nforces in nature. The  origin of these derived\nforces is, however, very complex.\n\nAt the present stage of our understanding,\nwe know of four fundamental forces in nature,\nwhich are described in brief here :\n\n Table 1.2  Link between technology and physics\n\nTechnology Scientific principle(s)\n\nSteam engine Laws of thermodynamics\n\nNuclear reactor Controlled nuclear fission\n\nRadio and Television Generation, propagation and detection\n\nof electromagnetic waves\n\nComputers Digital logic\n\nLasers Light amplification by stimulated emission of\nradiation\n\nProduction of ultra high magnetic Superconductivity\nfields\n\nRocket propulsion Newton’s laws of motion\n\nElectric generator Faraday’s laws of electromagnetic induction\n\nHydroelectric power Conversion of gravitational potential energy into\nelectrical energy\n\nAeroplane Bernoulli’s principle in fluid dynamics\n\nParticle accelerators Motion of charged particles in electromagnetic\nfields\n\nSonar Reflection of ultrasonic waves\n\nOptical fibres Total internal reflection of light\n\nNon-reflecting coatings Thin film optical interference\n\nElectron microscope Wave nature of electrons\n\nPhotocell Photoelectric effect\n\nFusion test reactor (Tokamak) Magnetic confinement of plasma\n\nGiant Metrewave Radio Detection of cosmic radio waves\nTelescope (GMRT)\n\nBose-Einstein condensate Trapping and cooling of atoms by laser beams and\nmagnetic fields.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS8\n\n1.4.1 Gravitational Force\n\nThe gravitational force is the force of mutual\nattraction between any two objects by virtue of\ntheir masses. It is a universal force. Every object\nexperiences this force due to every other object\nin the universe. All objects on the earth, for\nexample, experience the force of gravity due to\nthe earth. In particular, gravity governs the\nmotion of the moon and artificial satellites around\nthe earth, motion of the earth and planets\naround the sun, and, of course, the motion of\nbodies falling to the earth.  It plays a key role in\nthe large-scale phenomena of the universe, such\nas formation and evolution of stars, galaxies and\ngalactic clusters.\n\n1.4.2  Electromagnetic Force\n\nElectromagnetic force is the force between\ncharged particles.  In the simpler case when\ncharges are at rest, the force is given by\nCoulomb’s law : attractive for unlike charges and\nrepulsive for like charges. Charges in motion\nproduce magnetic effects and a magnetic field\ngives rise to a force on a moving charge. Electric\nand magnetic effects are, in general,\ninseparable – hence the name electromagnetic\nforce. Like the gravitational force,\nelectromagnetic force acts over large distances\nand does not need any intervening medium. It\nis enormously strong compared to gravity. The\n\nelectric force between two protons, for example,\n\nis 10\n36\n\n times the gravitational force between\n\nthem, for any fixed distance.\n\nMatter, as we know, consists of elementary\n\ncharged constituents like electrons and\n\nprotons. Since the electromagnetic force is so\n\nmuch stronger than the gravitational force, it\n\ndominates all phenomena at atomic and\n\nmolecular scales.  (The other two forces, as we\n\nshall see, operate only at nuclear scales.)  Thus\n\nit is mainly the electromagnetic force that\n\ngoverns the structure of atoms and molecules,\n\nthe dynamics of  chemical reactions and the\n\nmechanical, thermal and other properties of\n\nmaterials.  It underlies the macroscopic forces\n\nlike  ‘tension’, ‘friction’, ‘normal force’, ‘spring\n\nforce’, etc.\n\nGravity is always attractive, while\n\nelectromagnetic force can be attractive or\n\nrepulsive.  Another way of putting it is that mass\n\ncomes only in one variety (there is no negative\n\nmass), but charge comes in two varieties :\n\npositive and negative charge. This is what\n\nmakes all the difference.  Matter is mostly\n\nelectrically neutral (net charge is zero). Thus,\n\nelectric force is largely zero and gravitational\n\nforce dominates terrestrial phenomena. Electric\n\nforce manifests itself in atmosphere where the\n\natoms are ionised and that leads to lightning.\n\nAlbert Einstein (1879-1955)\n\nAlbert Einstein, born in Ulm, Germany in 1879, is universally regarded as\none of the greatest physicists of all time. His astonishing scientific career\nbegan with the publication of three path-breaking papers in 1905.  In the\nfirst paper, he introduced the notion of light quanta (now called photons)\nand used it to explain the features of photoelectric effect that the classical\nwave theory of radiation could not account for.  In the second paper, he\ndeveloped a theory of Brownian motion that was confirmed experimentally\na few years later and provided a convincing evidence of the atomic picture of\nmatter. The third paper gave birth to the special theory of relativity that\n\nmade Einstein a legend in his own life time.  In the next decade, he explored the consequences of his\nnew theory which included, among other things, the mass-energy equivalence enshrined in his famous\nequation E = mc2.  He also created the general version of relativity (The General Theory of Relativity),\nwhich is the modern theory of gravitation. Some of Einstein’s most significant later contributions are:\nthe notion of stimulated emission introduced in an alternative derivation of Planck’s blackbody radiation\nlaw, static model of the universe which started modern cosmology, quantum statistics of a gas of\nmassive bosons, and a critical analysis of the foundations of quantum mechanics. The year 2005 was\ndeclared as International Year of  Physics, in recognition of  Einstein’s monumental contribution to\nphysics, in year 1905, describing revolutionary scientific ideas that have since influenced all of modern\nphysics.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICAL WORLD 9\n\nIf we reflect a little, the enormous strength\nof the electromagnetic force compared to\ngravity is evident in our daily life.  When we\nhold a book in our hand, we are balancing the\ngravitational force on the book due to the huge\nmass of the earth by the ‘normal force’\nprovided by our hand.  The latter is nothing\nbut the net electromagnetic force between the\ncharged constituents of our hand and\nthe book, at the surface in contact. If\nelectromagnetic force were not intrinsically so\nmuch stronger than gravity, the hand of the\nstrongest man would crumble under the\nweight of a feather ! Indeed, to be consistent,\nin that circumstance, we ourselves would\ncrumble under our own weight !\n\n1.4.3  Strong Nuclear Force\n\nThe strong nuclear force binds protons and\nneutrons in a nucleus. It is evident that without\nsome attractive force, a nucleus will be\nunstable due to the electric repulsion between\nits protons. This attractive force cannot be\ngravitational since force of gravity is negligible\ncompared to the electric force. A new basic force\nmust, therefore, be  invoked. The strong nuclear\nforce  is  the strongest of all fundamental forces,\nabout 100 times the electromagnetic force in\n\nstrength.  It is charge-independent and acts\nequally between a proton and a proton, a\nneutron and a neutron, and a proton and a\nneutron. Its range is, however, extremely small,\nof about nuclear dimensions (10\n\n–15\nm). It is\n\nresponsible for the stability of nuclei. The\nelectron, it must be noted, does not experience\nthis force.\n\nRecent developments have, however,\nindicated that protons and neutrons are built\nout of still more elementary constituents called\nquarks.\n\n1.4.4  Weak Nuclear Force\n\nThe weak nuclear force appears only in certain\n\nnuclear processes such as the β-decay of a\n\nnucleus. In β-decay, the nucleus emits an\n\nelectron and an uncharged particle called\n\nneutrino.  The weak nuclear force is not as weak\n\nas the gravitational force, but much weaker\n\nthan the strong nuclear and electromagnetic\n\nforces. The range of weak nuclear force is\n\nexceedingly small, of the order of 10\n–16 \n\nm.\n\n1.4.5  Towards Unification of  Forces\n\nWe remarked in section 1.1 that unification is a\nbasic quest in physics. Great advances in\nphysics often amount to unification of different\n\nSatyendranath Bose (1894-1974)\n\nSatyendranath Bose, born in Calcutta in 1894, is among the great Indian\nphysicists who made a fundamental contribution to the advance of science\nin the twentieth century. An outstanding student throughout, Bose started\nhis career in 1916 as a lecturer in physics in Calcutta University; five years\nlater he joined Dacca University.  Here in 1924, in a brilliant flash of insight,\nBose gave a new derivation of Planck’s law, treating radiation as a gas of\nphotons and employing new statistical methods of counting of photon states.\nHe wrote a short paper on the subject and sent it to Einstein who\nimmediately recognised its great significance, translated it in German and\nforwarded it for publication.  Einstein then applied the same method to a\n\ngas of molecules.\nThe key new conceptual ingredient in Bose’s work was that the particles were regarded as\n\nindistinguishable, a radical departure from the assumption that underlies the classical Maxwell-\nBoltzmann statistics. It was soon realised that the new Bose-Einstein statistics was applicable to\nparticles with integers spins, and a new quantum statistics (Fermi-Dirac statistics) was needed for\nparticles with half integers spins satisfying Pauli’s exclusion principle. Particles with integers spins\nare now known as bosons in honour of Bose.\n\nAn important consequence of Bose-Einstein statistics is that a gas of molecules below a certain\ntemperature will undergo a phase transition to a state where a large fraction of atoms populate the\nsame lowest energy state. Some seventy years were to pass before the pioneering ideas of Bose, developed\nfurther by Einstein, were dramatically confirmed in the observation of a new state of matter in a dilute\ngas of ultra cold alkali atoms - the Bose-Eintein  condensate.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS10\n\ntheories and domains. Newton unified terrestrial\nand celestial domains under a common law of\ngravitation.  The experimental discoveries of\nOersted and Faraday showed that electric and\nmagnetic phenomena are in general\ninseparable.  Maxwell unified electromagnetism\nand optics with the discovery that light is an\nelectromagnetic wave.  Einstein attempted to\nunify gravity and electromagnetism but could\nnot succeed in this venture. But this did not\ndeter physicists from zealously pursuing the\ngoal of unification of forces.\n\nRecent decades have seen much progress on\nthis front.  The electromagnetic and the weak\nnuclear force have now been unified and are\nseen as aspects of a single ‘electro-weak’ force.\nWhat this unification actually means cannot\nbe explained here. Attempts have been (and are\nbeing) made to unify the electro-weak and the\nstrong force and even to unify the gravitational\nforce with the rest of the fundamental forces.\nMany of these ideas are still speculative and\ninconclusive. Table 1.4 summarises some of the\nmilestones in the progress towards unification\nof forces in nature.\n\n1.5   NATURE OF PHYSICAL LAWS\n\nPhysicists explore the universe. Their\ninvestigations, based on scientific processes,\nrange from particles that are smaller than\natoms in size to stars that are very far away. In\naddition to finding the facts by observation and\nexperimentation, physicists attempt to discover\nthe laws that summarise (often as mathematical\nequations) these facts.\n\nIn any physical phenomenon governed by\ndifferent forces, several quantities may change\nwith time. A remarkable fact is that some special\nphysical quantities, however, remain constant\nin time. They are the conserved quantities of\nnature. Understanding these conservation\nprinciples is very important to describe the\nobserved phenomena quantitatively.\n\nFor motion under an external conservative\nforce, the total mechanical energy i.e. the sum\nof kinetic and potential energy of a body is a\nconstant. The familiar example is the free fall of\nan object under gravity. Both the kinetic energy\nof the object and its potential energy change\ncontinuously with time, but the sum remains\nfixed. If the object is released from rest, the initial\n\nTable 1.4  Progress in unification of different forces/domains in nature\n\nTable 1.3  Fundamental  forces  of  nature\n\nName Relative Range Operates among\nstrength\n\nGravitational force 10–39 Infinite All objects in the universe\n\nWeak nuclear force 10–13 Very short, Sub-nuclear Some elementary particles,\nsize (∼10–16m) particularly electron and\n\nneutrino\n\nElectromagnetic force 10–2 Infinite Charged particles\n\nStrong nuclear force 1 Short, nuclear Nucleons, heavier\nsize (∼10–15m) elementary particles\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICAL WORLD 11\n\npotential energy is completely converted into the\nkinetic energy of the object just before it hits\nthe ground. This law restricted for a conservative\nforce should not be confused with the general\nlaw of conservation of energy of an isolated\nsystem (which is the basis of the First Law of\nThermodynamics).\n\nThe concept of energy is central to physics\nand the expressions for energy can be written\nfor every physical system. When all forms of\nenergy e.g., heat, mechanical energy, electrical\nenergy etc., are counted, it turns out that energy\nis conserved. The general law of conservation of\nenergy is true for all forces and for any kind of\ntransformation between different forms of\nenergy. In the falling object example, if you\ninclude the effect of air resistance during the\nfall and see the situation after the object hits\nthe ground and stays there, the total\nmechanical energy is obviously not conserved.\nThe general law of energy conservation, however,\nis still applicable.  The initial potential energy\nof the stone gets transformed into other forms\nof energy : heat and sound. (Ultimately, sound\nafter it is absorbed becomes heat.) The total\nenergy of the system (stone plus the\nsurroundings) remains unchanged.\n\nThe law of conservation of energy is thought\nto be valid across all domains of nature, from\nthe microscopic to the macroscopic. It is\nroutinely applied in the analysis of atomic,\nnuclear and elementary particle processes.  At\n\nthe other end, all kinds of violent phenomena\noccur in the universe all the time.  Yet the total\nenergy of the universe (the most ideal isolated\nsystem possible !) is believed to remain\nunchanged.\n\nUntil the advent of Einstein’s theory of\nrelativity, the law of conservation of mass was\nregarded as another basic conservation law of\nnature, since matter was thought to be\nindestructible. It was (and still is) an important\nprinciple used, for example, in the analysis of\nchemical reactions. A chemical reaction is\nbasically a rearrangement of atoms among\ndifferent molecules.  If the total binding energy\nof the reacting molecules is less than the total\nbinding energy of the product molecules, the\ndifference appears as heat and the reaction is\nexothermic.  The opposite is true for energy\nabsorbing (endothermic) reactions.  However,\nsince the atoms are merely rearranged but not\ndestroyed, the total mass of the reactants is the\nsame as the total mass of the products in a\nchemical reaction. The changes in the binding\nenergy are too small to be measured as changes\nin mass.\n\nAccording to Einstein’s theory, mass m is\nequivalent to energy E given by the relation\nE = mc\n\n2\n, where c is speed of light in vacuum.\n\nIn a nuclear process mass gets converted to\nenergy (or vice-versa). This is the energy which\nis released in a nuclear power generation and\n\nnuclear explosions.\n\nSir C.V. Raman (1888-1970)\n\nChandrashekhara Venkata Raman  was born on 07 Nov 1888 in Thiruvanaikkaval.\nHe finished his schooling by the age of eleven. He graduated from Presidency\nCollege, Madras. After finishing his education he joined financial services of the\nIndian Government.\n\nWhile in Kolkata, he started working on his area of interest at Indian Asso-\nciation for Cultivation of Science founded  by Dr. Mahendra Lal Sirkar, during his\nevening hours. His area of interest included vibrations, variety of musical instru-\nments, ultrasonics, diffraction and so on.\n\nIn 1917 he was offered Professorship at Calcutta University. In 1924 he was\nelected ‘Fellow’ of the Royal Society of London and received Nobel prize in Physics\nin 1930 for his discovery, now known as Raman Effect.\n\nThe Raman Effect deals with scattering of light by molecules of a medium\nwhen they are excited to vibrational energy levels. This work opened totally new\navenues for research for years to come.\n\nHe spent his later years at Bangalore, first at Indian Institute of Science and then at Raman Re-\nsearch Institute. His work has inspired generation of young students.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS12\n\nEnergy is a scalar quantity.  But all conserved\n\nquantities are not necessarily scalars.  The total\n\nlinear momentum and the total angular\n\nmomentum (both vectors) of an isolated system\n\nare also conserved quantities.  These laws can\n\nbe derived from Newton’s laws of motion in\n\nmechanics.  But their validity goes beyond\n\nmechanics.  They are the basic conservation\n\nlaws of nature in all domains, even in those\n\nwhere Newton’s laws may not be valid.\n\nBesides their great simplicity and generality,\n\nthe conservation laws of nature are very useful\n\nin practice too.  It often happens that we cannot\n\nsolve the full dynamics of a complex problem\n\ninvolving different particles and forces. The\n\nconservation laws can still provide useful\n\nresults.  For example, we may not know the\n\ncomplicated forces that act during a collision\n\nof two automobiles; yet momentum\n\nconservation law enables us to bypass the\n\ncomplications and predict or rule out possible\n\noutcomes of the collision. In nuclear and\n\nelementary particle phenomena also, the\n\nconservation laws are important tools of\n\nanalysis.  Indeed, using the conservation laws\n\nof energy and momentum for β-decay, Wolfgang\n\nPauli (1900-1958) correctly predicted in 1931\n\nthe existence of a new particle (now called\n\nneutrino) emitted in β-decay along with the\n\nelectron.\n\nConservation laws have a deep connection\n\nwith symmetries of nature that you will explore\n\nin more advanced courses in physics.  For\n\nexample, an important observation is that the\n\nlaws of nature do not change with time!  If you\n\nperform an experiment in your laboratory today\n\nand repeat the same experiment (on the same\n\nobjects under identical conditions) after a year,\n\nthe results are bound to be the same.  It turns\n\nout that this symmetry of nature with respect to\n\ntranslation (i.e. displacement) in time is\n\nequivalent to the law of conservation of energy.\n\nLikewise, space is homogeneous and there is no\n\n(intrinsically) preferred location in the universe.\n\nTo put it more clearly, the laws of nature are the\n\nsame everywhere in the universe. (Caution : the\n\nphenomena may differ from place to place\n\nbecause of differing conditions at different\n\nlocations. For example, the acceleration due to\n\ngravity at the moon is one-sixth that at the earth,\n\nbut the law of gravitation is the same both on\nthe moon and the earth.)  This symmetry of the\n\nlaws of nature with respect to translation in\n\nspace gives rise to conservation of linear\n\nmomentum.  In the same way isotropy of space\n\n(no intrinsically preferred direction in space)\n\nunderlies the law of conservation of angular\n\nmomentum*. The conservation laws of charge and\nother attributes of elementary particles can also\n\nbe related to certain abstract symmetries.\n\nSymmetries of space and time and other abstract\n\nsymmetries play a central role in modern theories\n\nof fundamental forces in nature.\n\n* See Chapter 7\n\nConservation laws in physics\n\nConservation of energy, momentum, angular\nmomentum, charge, etc are considered to be\nfundamental laws in physics. At this moment,\nthere are many such conservation laws. Apart from\nthe above four, there are others which mostly deal\nwith quantities which have been introduced in\nnuclear and particle physics. Some of the\nconserved quantities are called spin, baryon\nnumber, strangeness, hypercharge, etc, but you\nneed not worry about them.\n\nA conservation law is a hypothesis, based on\nobservations and experiments. It is important to\nremember that a conservation law cannot be\nproved. It can be verified, or disproved, by\nexperiments. An experiment whose result is  in\nconformity with the law verifies or substantiates\nthe law; it does not prove the law. On the other\nhand, a single experiment whose result goes\nagainst the law is enough to disprove it.\n\nIt would be wrong to ask somebody to prove\nthe law of conservation of energy. This law is an\noutcome of our experience over several centuries,\nand it has been found to be valid in all\nexperiments, in mechanics, thermodynamics,\nelectromagnetism, optics, atomic and nuclear\nphysics, or any other area.\n\nSome students feel that they can prove the\nconservation of mechanical energy from a body\nfalling under gravity, by adding the kinetic and\npotential energies at a point and showing that it\nturns out to be constant. As pointed out above,\nthis is only a verification of the law, not its proof.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICAL WORLD 13\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. Physics deals with the study of the basic laws of nature and their manifestation in\ndifferent phenomena. The basic laws of physics are universal and apply in widely different\ncontexts and conditions.\n\n2. The scope of physics is wide, covering a tremendous range of magnitude of physical\nquantities.\n\n3. Physics and technology are related to each other.  Sometimes technology gives rise to\nnew physics; at other times physics generates new technology.  Both have direct impact\non society.\n\n4. There are four fundamental forces in nature that govern the diverse phenomena of the\nmacroscopic and the microscopic world. These are the ‘gravitational force’, the\n‘electromagnetic force’, the ‘strong nuclear force’, and the ‘weak nuclear force’.  Unification\nof different forces/domains in nature is a basic quest in physics.\n\n5. The physical quantities that remain unchanged in a process are called conserved\nquantities. Some of the general conservation laws in nature include the laws of\nconservation of mass, energy, linear momentum, angular momentum, charge, parity,\netc.  Some conservation laws are true for one fundamental force but not for the other.\n\n6. Conservation laws have a deep connection with symmetries of nature.  Symmetries of\nspace and time, and other types of symmetries play a central role in modern theories of\nfundamental forces in nature.\n\nEXERCISES\n\nNote for the student\n\nThe exercises given here are meant to enhance your awareness about the issues surrounding\nscience, technology and society and to encourage you to think and formulate your views\nabout them.  The questions may not have clear-cut ‘objective’ answers.\n\nNote for the teacher\n\nThe exercises given here are not  for the purpose of a formal examination.\n\n1.1 Some of the most profound statements on the nature of science have come from\nAlbert Einstein, one of the greatest scientists of all time.  What do you think did\nEinstein mean when he said :  “The most incomprehensible thing about the world is\nthat it is comprehensible”?\n\n1.2 “Every great physical theory starts as a heresy and ends as a dogma”. Give some\nexamples from the history of science of the validity of this incisive remark.\n\n1.3 “Politics is the art of the possible”. Similarly, “Science is the art of the soluble”.\nExplain this beautiful aphorism on the nature and practice of science.\n\n1.4 Though India now has a large base in science and technology, which is fast expanding,\nit is still a long way from realising its potential of becoming a world leader in science.\nName some important factors, which in your view have hindered the advancement of\nscience in India.\n\n1.5 No physicist has ever “seen” an electron.  Yet, all physicists believe in the existence of\nelectrons.  An intelligent but superstitious man advances this analogy to argue that\n‘ghosts’ exist even though no one has ‘seen’ one.  How will you refute his argument ?\n\n1.6 The shells of crabs found around a particular coastal location in Japan seem mostly\nto resemble the legendary face of a Samurai.  Given below are two explanations of this\nobserved fact.  Which of these strikes you as a scientific explanation ?\n\n(a) A tragic sea accident several centuries ago drowned a young Samurai. As a tribute\nto his bravery, nature through its inscrutable ways immortalised his face by\nimprinting it on the crab shells in that area.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS14\n\n(b) After the sea tragedy, fishermen in that  area, in a gesture of honour to their\ndead hero, let free any crab shell caught by them which accidentally had a shape\nresembling the face of a Samurai.  Consequently, the particular shape  of the\ncrab shell survived longer and therefore in course of time the shape was genetically\npropagated.  This is an example of evolution by artificial selection.\n\n[Note : This interesting illustration taken from Carl Sagan’s ‘The Cosmos’ highlights\nthe fact that often strange and inexplicable facts which on the first sight appear\n‘supernatural’ actually turn out to have simple scientific explanations. Try to think\nout other examples of this kind].\n\n1.7 The industrial revolution in England and Western Europe more than two centuries\nago was triggered by some key scientific and technological advances.  What were these\nadvances ?\n\n1.8 It is often said that the world is witnessing now a second industrial revolution, which\nwill transform the society as radically as did the first. List some key contemporary areas\nof science and technology, which are responsible for this revolution.\n\n1.9 Write in about 1000 words a fiction piece based on your speculation on the science\nand technology of the twenty-second century.\n\n1.10 Attempt to formulate your ‘moral’ views on the practice of science.  Imagine yourself\nstumbling upon a discovery, which has great academic interest but is certain to have\nnothing but dangerous consequences for the human society.  How, if at all, will you\nresolve your dilemma ?\n\n1.11 Science, like any knowledge, can be put to good or bad use, depending on the user.\nGiven below are some of the applications of science.  Formulate your views on whether\nthe particular application is good, bad or something that cannot be so clearly\ncategorised :\n(a) Mass vaccination against small pox to curb and finally eradicate this disease\n\nfrom the population. (This has already been successfully done in India).\n(b) Television for eradication of illiteracy and for mass communication of news and\n\nideas.\n(c) Prenatal sex determination\n(d) Computers for increase in work efficiency\n(e) Putting artificial satellites into orbits  around the Earth\n(f ) Development of nuclear weapons\n(g) Development of new and powerful techniques of chemical and biological warfare).\n(h) Purification of water for drinking\n(i) Plastic surgery\n(j ) Cloning\n\n1.12 India has had a long and unbroken tradition of great scholarship — in mathematics,\nastronomy, linguistics, logic and ethics.  Yet, in parallel with this, several superstitious\nand obscurantistic  attitudes and practices flourished in our society and unfortunately\ncontinue even today — among many educated people too. How will you use your\nknowledge of science to develop strategies to counter these attitudes ?\n\n1.13 Though the law gives women equal status in India, many people hold unscientific\nviews on a woman’s innate nature, capacity and intelligence, and in practice give\nthem a secondary status and role. Demolish this view using scientific arguments, and\nby quoting examples of great women in science and other spheres; and persuade yourself\nand others that, given equal opportunity, women are on par with men.\n\n1.14 “It is more important to have beauty in the equations of physics than to have them\nagree with experiments”. The great British physicist P. A. M. Dirac held this view.\nCriticize this statement.  Look out for some equations and results in this book which\nstrike you as beautiful.\n\n1.15 Though the statement quoted above may be disputed, most physicists do have a feeling\nthat the great laws of physics are at once simple and beautiful. Some of the notable\nphysicists, besides Dirac, who have articulated this feeling, are : Einstein, Bohr,\nHeisenberg, Chandrasekhar and Feynman. You are urged to make special efforts to get\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICAL WORLD 15\n\naccess to the general books and writings by these and other great masters of physics.\n(See the Bibliography at the end of this book.) Their writings are truly inspiring !\n\n1.16 Textbooks on science may give you a wrong impression that studying science is dry\nand all too serious and that scientists are absent-minded introverts who never laugh\nor grin.  This image of science and scientists is patently false. Scientists, like any\nother group of humans, have their share of humorists, and many have led their lives\nwith a great sense of fun and adventure, even as they seriously pursued their scientific\nwork. Two great physicists of this genre are Gamow and Feynman. You will enjoy\nreading their books listed in the Bibliography.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter_1.pmd\n\n\n1.1  WHAT IS PHYSICS ?\n\nHumans have always been curious about the world around\nthem. The night sky with its bright celestial objects has\nfascinated humans since time immemorial. The regular\nrepetitions of the day and night, the annual cycle of seasons,\nthe eclipses, the tides, the volcanoes, the rainbow have always\nbeen a source of wonder. The world has an astonishing variety\nof materials and a bewildering diversity of life and behaviour.\nThe inquiring and imaginative human mind has responded\nto the wonder and awe of nature in different ways. One kind\nof response from the earliest times has been to observe the\nphysical environment carefully, look for any meaningful\npatterns and relations in natural phenomena, and build and\nuse new tools to interact with nature.  This human endeavour\nled, in course of time, to modern science and technology.\n\nThe word Science originates from the Latin verb Scientia\nmeaning ‘to know’.  The Sanskrit word Vijñãn and the Arabic\nword Ilm convey similar meaning, namely ‘knowledge’.\nScience, in a broad sense, is as old as human species. The\nearly civilisations of Egypt, India, China, Greece, Mesopotamia\nand many others made vital contributions to its progress.\nFrom the sixteenth century onwards, great strides were made\nin science in Europe. By the middle of the twentieth century,\nscience had become a truly international enterprise, with\nmany cultures and countries contributing to its rapid growth.\n\nWhat is Science and what is the so-called Scientific\nMethod?  Science is a systematic attempt to understand\nnatural phenomena in as much detail and depth as possible,\nand use the knowledge so gained to predict, modify and\ncontrol phenomena. Science is exploring, experimenting and\npredicting from what we see around us. The curiosity to learn\nabout the world, unravelling the secrets of nature is the first\nstep towards the discovery of science. The scientific method\ninvolves several interconnected steps : Systematic\nobservations, controlled experiments, qualitative and\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nPHYSICAL WORLD\n\n1.1 What is physics ?\n\n1.2 Scope and excitement of\nphysics\n\n1.3 Physics, technology and\nsociety\n\n1.4 Fundamental forces in\nnature\n\n1.5 Nature of physical laws\n\nSummary\n\nExercises\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS2\n\nquantitative reasoning, mathematical\nmodelling, prediction and verification or\nfalsification of theories. Speculation and\nconjecture also have a place in science; but\nultimately, a scientific theory, to be acceptable,\nmust be verified by relevant observations  or\nexperiments. There is much philosophical\ndebate about the nature and method of science\nthat we need not discuss here.\n\nThe interplay of theory and observation (or\nexperiment) is basic to the progress of science.\nScience is ever dynamic. There is no ‘final’\ntheory in science and no unquestioned\nauthority among scientists.  As observations\nimprove in detail and precision or experiments\nyield new results, theories must account for\nthem, if necessary, by introducing modifications.\nSometimes the modifications may not be drastic\nand may lie within the framework of existing\ntheory.  For example, when Johannes Kepler\n(1571-1630) examined the extensive data on\nplanetary motion collected by Tycho Brahe\n(1546-1601), the planetary circular orbits in\nheliocentric  theory (sun at the centre of the\nsolar system) imagined by Nicolas Copernicus\n(1473–1543) had to be replaced by elliptical\norbits to fit the data better.  Occasionally,\nhowever, the  existing theory is simply unable\nto explain new observations.  This causes a\nmajor upheaval in science. In the beginning of\nthe twentieth century, it was realised that\nNewtonian mechanics, till then a very\nsuccessful theory, could not explain some of the\nmost basic features of atomic phenomena.\nSimilarly, the then accepted wave picture of light\nfailed to explain the photoelectric effect properly.\nThis led to the development of a  radically new\ntheory (Quantum Mechanics) to deal with atomic\nand molecular phenomena.\n\nJust as a new experiment may suggest an\nalternative theoretical model, a theoretical\nadvance may suggest what to look for in some\nexperiments.  The result of experiment of\nscattering of alpha particles by gold foil, in 1911\nby Ernest Rutherford (1871–1937) established\nthe nuclear model of the atom, which then\nbecame the basis of the quantum theory of\nhydrogen atom given in 1913 by Niels Bohr\n(1885–1962). On the other hand, the concept of\nantiparticle was first introduced theoretically by\nPaul Dirac (1902–1984) in 1930 and confirmed\ntwo years later by the experimental discovery of\npositron (antielectron) by Carl Anderson.\n\nPhysics is a basic discipline in the category\n\nof Natural Sciences, which also includes other\ndisciplines like Chemistry and Biology. The word\n\nPhysics comes from a Greek word meaning\nnature. Its Sanskrit equivalent is Bhautiki that\nis used to refer to the study of the physical world.\n\nA precise definition of this discipline is neither\npossible nor necessary.  We can broadly describe\n\nphysics as a study of the basic laws of  nature\nand their manifestation in different natural\n\nphenomena.  The scope of physics is described\nbriefly in the next section.  Here we remark on\ntwo principal thrusts in physics :  unification\nand reduction.\n\nIn Physics, we attempt to explain diverse\n\nphysical phenomena in terms of a few concepts\nand laws.  The effort is to see the physical world\nas manifestation of some universal laws in\n\ndifferent domains and conditions.  For example,\nthe same law of gravitation (given by Newton)\n\ndescribes the fall of an apple to the ground, the\nmotion of the moon around the earth and the\n\nmotion of planets around the sun. Similarly, the\nbasic laws of electromagnetism (Maxwell’s\nequations) govern all electric and magnetic\n\nphenomena. The attempts to unify fundamental\nforces of nature (section 1.4) reflect this same\n\nquest for unification.\nA related effort is to derive the properties of a\n\nbigger, more complex, system from the properties\n\nand interactions of its constituent simpler parts.\nThis approach is called reductionism and is\nat the heart of physics.  For example, the subject\nof thermodynamics, developed in the nineteenth\ncentury, deals with bulk systems in terms of\n\nmacroscopic quantities such as temperature,\ninternal energy, entropy, etc.  Subsequently, the\n\nsubjects of kinetic theory and statistical\nmechanics interpreted these quantities in terms\n\nof the properties of the molecular constituents\nof the bulk system.  In particular, the\ntemperature was seen to be related to the average\n\nkinetic energy of molecules  of the system.\n\n1.2  SCOPE AND EXCITEMENT OF PHYSICS\n\nWe can get some idea of the scope of physics by\nlooking at its various sub-disciplines.  Basically,\nthere are two domains of interest : macroscopic\nand microscopic. The macroscopic domain\nincludes phenomena at the laboratory, terrestrial\nand astronomical scales. The microscopic domain\nincludes atomic, molecular and nuclear\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICAL WORLD 3\n\nAmpere and Faraday, and encapsulated by\nMaxwell in his famous set of equations. The\nmotion of a current-carrying conductor in a\nmagnetic field, the response of a circuit to an ac\nvoltage (signal), the working of an antenna, the\npropagation of radio waves in the ionosphere, etc.,\nare problems of electrodynamics. Optics deals\nwith the phenomena involving light. The working\nof telescopes and microscopes, colours exhibited\nby thin films, etc., are topics in optics.\nThermodynamics, in contrast to mechanics, does\nnot deal with the motion of bodies as a whole.\nRather, it deals with systems in macroscopic\nequilibrium and is concerned with changes in\ninternal energy, temperature, entropy, etc., of the\nsystem through external work and transfer of\nheat.  The efficiency of heat engines and\nrefrigerators, the direction of a physical or\n\nYou can now see that the scope of physics is\n\ntruly vast.  It covers a tremendous range of\n\nmagnitude of physical quantities like length,\n\nmass, time, energy, etc.  At one end, it studies\n\nphenomena at the very small scale of length\n\n(10\n-14 \n\nm or even less) involving electrons, protons,\n\netc.; at the other end, it deals with astronomical\n\nphenomena at the scale of galaxies or even the\n\nentire universe whose extent is of the order of\n\n10\n26 \n\nm.  The two length scales differ by a factor of\n\n10\n40\n\n or even more.  The range of time scales can\n\nbe obtained by dividing the length scales by the\n\nspeed of light : 10\n–22 \n\ns to 1018\n \ns.  The range of\n\nmasses goes from, say, 10–30 kg  (mass of an\n\nelectron) to 10\n55 \n\nkg (mass of known observable\n\nuniverse). Terrestrial phenomena lie somewhere\n\nin the middle of this range.\n\nFig. 1.1 Theory and experiment go hand in hand in physics and help each other’s progress. The alpha scattering\nexperiments of Rutherford gave the nuclear model of the atom.\n\n* Recently, the domain intermediate between the macroscopic and the microscopic (the so-called mesoscopic\nphysics), dealing with a few tens or hundreds of atoms, has emerged as an exciting  field of  research.\n\nphenomena*. Classical Physics deals mainly\nwith macroscopic phenomena and includes\nsubjects like Mechanics, Electrodynamics,\nOptics and Thermodynamics. Mechanics\nfounded on Newton’s laws of motion and the law\nof gravitation is concerned with the motion (or\nequilibrium) of particles, rigid and deformable\nbodies, and general systems of particles.  The\npropulsion of a rocket by a jet of ejecting gases,\npropagation of water waves or sound waves in\nair, the equilibrium of a bent rod under a load,\netc., are problems of mechanics.  Electrodynamics\ndeals with electric and magnetic phenomena\nassociated with charged and magnetic bodies.\nIts basic laws were given by Coulomb, Oersted,\n\nchemical process, etc., are problems of interest\n\nin thermodynamics.\n\nThe microscopic domain of physics deals  with\n\nthe constitution and structure of matter at the\n\nminute scales of atoms and nuclei (and even\n\nlower scales of length) and their interaction with\n\ndifferent probes such as electrons, photons and\n\nother elementary particles. Classical physics is\n\ninadequate to handle this domain and Quantum\n\nTheory is currently accepted as the proper\n\nframework for explaining microscopic\n\nphenomena.  Overall, the edifice of physics is\n\nbeautiful and imposing and you will appreciate\n\nit more as you pursue the subject.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS4\n\nPhysics is exciting in many ways. To some people\nthe excitement comes from the elegance and\nuniversality of its basic theories, from the fact that\na few basic concepts and laws can explain\nphenomena covering a large range of magnitude\nof physical quantities. To some others, the challenge\nin carrying out imaginative new experiments to\nunlock the secrets of nature, to verify or refute\ntheories, is thrilling.  Applied physics is equally\ndemanding. Application and exploitation of\nphysical laws to make useful devices is the most\ninteresting and exciting part and requires great\ningenuity and persistence of effort.\n\nWhat lies behind the phenomenal progress\nof physics in the last few centuries? Great\nprogress usually accompanies changes in our\nbasic perceptions.  First, it was realised that for\nscientific progress, only qualitative thinking,\nthough no doubt important, is not enough.\nQuantitative measurement is central to the\ngrowth of science, especially physics, because\nthe laws of nature happen to be expressible in\nprecise mathematical equations. The second\nmost important insight was that the basic laws\nof physics are universal — the same laws apply\nin widely different contexts. Lastly, the strategy\nof approximation turned out to be very\nsuccessful.  Most observed phenomena in daily\nlife are rather complicated manifestations of the\nbasic laws. Scientists recognised the importance\nof extracting the essential features of a\nphenomenon from its less significant aspects.\nIt is not practical to take into account all the\ncomplexities of a phenomenon in one go.  A good\nstrategy is to focus first on the essential features,\ndiscover the basic principles and then introduce\ncorrections to build a more refined theory of the\nphenomenon. For example, a stone and a feather\ndropped from the same height do not reach the\nground at the same time. The reason is that the\nessential aspect of the phenomenon, namely free\nfall under gravity, is complicated by the\npresence of air resistance. To get the law of free\nfall under gravity, it is better to create a\nsituation wherein the air resistance is\nnegligible. We can, for example, let the stone and\nthe feather fall through a long evacuated tube.\nIn that case, the two objects will fall almost at\nthe same rate, giving the basic law that\nacceleration due to gravity is independent of the\nmass of the object.  With the basic law thus\nfound, we can go back to the feather, introduce\ncorrections due to air resistance, modify the\nexisting theory and try to build a more realistic\n\nHypothesis, axioms and models\n\nOne should not think that everything can be proved\nwith physics and mathematics. All physics, and also\nmathematics, is based on assumptions, each of\nwhich is variously called a hypothesis or axiom or\npostulate, etc.\n\nFor example, the universal law of gravitation\nproposed by Newton is an assumption or hypothesis,\nwhich he proposed out of his ingenuity. Before him,\nthere were several observations, experiments and\ndata, on the motion of planets around the sun,\nmotion of the moon around the earth, pendulums,\nbodies falling towards the earth etc. Each of these\nrequired a separate explanation, which was more\nor less qualitative. What the universal law of\ngravitation says is that, if we assume that any two\nbodies in the universe attract each other with a\nforce proportional to the product of their masses\nand inversely proportional to the square of the\ndistance between them, then we can explain all\nthese observations in one stroke. It not only explains\nthese phenomena, it also allows us to predict the\nresults of future experiments.\n\nA hypothesis is a supposition without assuming\nthat it is true. It would not be fair to ask anybody\nto prove the universal law of gravitation, because\nit cannot be proved. It can be verified and\nsubstantiated by experiments and observations.\n\nAn axiom is a self-evident truth while a model\nis a theory proposed to explain observed\nphenomena. But you need not worry at this stage\nabout the nuances in using these words. For\nexample, next year you will learn about Bohr’s model\nof hydrogen atom, in which Bohr assumed that an\nelectron in the hydrogen atom follows certain rules\n(postutates). Why did he do that? There was a large\namount of spectroscopic data before him which no\nother theory could explain. So Bohr said that if we\nassume that an atom behaves in such a manner,\nwe can explain all these things at once.\n\nEinstein’s special theory of relativity is also\nbased on two postulates, the constancy of the speed\nof electromagnetic radiation and the validity of\nphysical laws in all inertial frame of reference. It\nwould not be wise to ask somebody to prove that\nthe speed of light in vacuum is constant,\nindependent of the source or observer.\n\nIn mathematics too, we need axioms and\nhypotheses at every stage. Euclid’s statement that\nparallel lines never meet, is a hypothesis. This means\nthat if we assume this statement, we can explain\nseveral properties of straight lines and two or three\ndimensional figures made out of them. But if you\ndon’t assume it, you are free to use a different axiom\nand get a new geometry, as has indeed happened in\nthe past few centuries and decades.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICAL WORLD 5\n\nTable 1.1 Some physicists from different countries of the world and their major contributions\n\ntheory of objects falling to the earth under\ngravity.\n\n1.3  PHYSICS, TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIETY\n\nThe connection between physics, technology\nand society can be seen in many examples. The\ndiscipline of thermodynamics arose from the\nneed to understand and improve the working of\nheat engines.  The steam engine, as we know,\nis inseparable from the Industrial Revolution in\nEngland in the eighteenth century, which had\ngreat impact on the course of human\ncivilisation. Sometimes technology gives rise to\nnew physics; at other times physics generates\nnew technology. An example of the latter is the\nwireless communication technology that followed\nthe discovery of the basic laws of electricity and\nmagnetism in the nineteenth century. The\napplications of  physics are not always easy to\nforesee. As late as 1933, the great physicist\nErnest Rutherford had dismissed the possibility\nof tapping energy from atoms. But only a few\nyears later, in 1938, Hahn and Meitner\ndiscovered the phenomenon of neutron-induced\nfission of uranium, which would serve as the\nbasis of nuclear power reactors and nuclear\nweapons. Yet another important example of\nphysics giving rise to technology is the silicon\n‘chip’ that triggered  the computer revolution in\nthe last three decades of the twentieth century.\n\nA most significant area to which physics has\nand will contribute is the development of\nalternative energy resources.  The fossil fuels of\nthe planet are dwindling fast and there is an\nurgent need to discover new and affordable\nsources of energy.  Considerable progress has\nalready been made in this direction (for\nexample, in conversion of solar energy,\ngeothermal energy, etc., into electricity), but\nmuch more is still to be accomplished.\n\nTable1.1 lists some of the great physicists,\ntheir major contribution and the country of\norigin. You will appreciate from this table the\nmulti-cultural, international character of the\nscientific endeavour. Table 1.2 lists some\nimportant technologies and the principles of\nphysics  they  are  based on.  Obviously,  these\ntables are not exhaustive. We urge you to try to\nadd many names and items to these tables with\nthe help of your teachers, good books and\nwebsites on science.  You will find that this\nexercise is very educative and also great fun.\nAnd, assuredly, it will never end.  The progress\nof science is unstoppable!\n\nPhysics is the study of nature and natural\nphenomena. Physicists try to discover the rules\nthat are operating in nature, on the basis of\nobservations, experimentation and analysis.\nPhysics deals with certain basic rules/laws\ngoverning the natural world.

However, we\nadvise you to read them carefully to develop a feel for some basic aspects of  physics. These are some of the\n\nareas which continue to occupy the physicists today.\n\nof physical laws? We shall now discuss the\nnature of fundamental forces and the laws that\ngovern the diverse phenomena of the physical\nworld.\n\n1.4  FUNDAMENTAL FORCES IN NATURE*\n\nWe all have an intuitive notion of force. In our\nexperience, force is needed to push, carry or\nthrow objects, deform or break them.  We also\nexperience the impact of forces on us, like when\na moving object hits us or we are in a merry-go-\nround. Going from this intuitive notion to the\nproper scientific concept of force is not a trivial\nmatter. Early thinkers like Aristotle had wrong\n\nideas about it.  The correct notion of force was\narrived at by Isaac Newton in his famous laws of\nmotion. He also gave an explicit form for the force\nfor gravitational attraction between two bodies.\nWe shall learn these matters in subsequent\nchapters.\n\nIn the macroscopic world, besides the\ngravitational force, we encounter several kinds\nof forces: muscular force, contact forces between\nbodies, friction (which is also a contact force\nparallel to the surfaces in contact), the forces\nexerted by compressed or elongated springs and\ntaut strings and ropes (tension), the force of\nbuoyancy and viscous force when solids are in\n\nVictor Francis Hess Cosmic radiation Austria\n\nR.A.

There are also forces involving charged\nand magnetic bodies. In the microscopic domain\nagain, we have electric and magnetic forces,\nnuclear forces involving protons and neutrons,\ninteratomic and intermolecular forces, etc.  We\nshall get familiar with some of these forces in later\nparts of this course.\n\nA great insight of the twentieth century\nphysics is that these different forces occurring\nin different contexts actually arise from only a\nsmall number of fundamental forces in nature.\nFor example, the elastic spring force arises due\n\nto the net attraction/repulsion between the\nneighbouring atoms of the spring when the\nspring is elongated/compressed. This net\n\nattraction/repulsion can be traced to the\n(unbalanced) sum of electric forces between the\ncharged constituents of the atoms.\n\nIn principle, this means that the laws for\n‘derived’ forces (such as spring force, friction)\nare not independent of the laws of fundamental\nforces in nature. The  origin of these derived\nforces is, however, very complex.\n\nAt the present stage of our understanding,\nwe know of four fundamental forces in nature,\nwhich are described in brief here :\n\n Table 1.2  Link between technology and physics\n\nTechnology Scientific principle(s)\n\nSteam engine Laws of thermodynamics\n\nNuclear reactor Controlled nuclear fission\n\nRadio and Television Generation, propagation and detection\n\nof electromagnetic waves\n\nComputers Digital logic\n\nLasers Light amplification by stimulated emission of\nradiation\n\nProduction of ultra high magnetic Superconductivity\nfields\n\nRocket propulsion Newton’s laws of motion\n\nElectric generator Faraday’s laws of electromagnetic induction\n\nHydroelectric power Conversion of gravitational potential energy into\nelectrical energy\n\nAeroplane Bernoulli’s principle in fluid dynamics\n\nParticle accelerators Motion of charged particles in electromagnetic\nfields\n\nSonar Reflection of ultrasonic waves\n\nOptical fibres Total internal reflection of light\n\nNon-reflecting coatings Thin film optical interference\n\nElectron microscope Wave nature of electrons\n\nPhotocell Photoelectric effect\n\nFusion test reactor (Tokamak) Magnetic confinement of plasma\n\nGiant Metrewave Radio Detection of cosmic radio waves\nTelescope (GMRT)\n\nBose-Einstein condensate Trapping and cooling of atoms by laser beams and\nmagnetic fields.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS8\n\n1.4.1 Gravitational Force\n\nThe gravitational force is the force of mutual\nattraction between any two objects by virtue of\ntheir masses. It is a universal force. Every object\nexperiences this force due to every other object\nin the universe. All objects on the earth, for\nexample, experience the force of gravity due to\nthe earth. In particular, gravity governs the\nmotion of the moon and artificial satellites around\nthe earth, motion of the earth and planets\naround the sun, and, of course, the motion of\nbodies falling to the earth.  It plays a key role in\nthe large-scale phenomena of the universe, such\nas formation and evolution of stars, galaxies and\ngalactic clusters.\n\n1.4.2  Electromagnetic Force\n\nElectromagnetic force is the force between\ncharged particles.  In the simpler case when\ncharges are at rest, the force is given by\nCoulomb’s law : attractive for unlike charges and\nrepulsive for like charges. Charges in motion\nproduce magnetic effects and a magnetic field\ngives rise to a force on a moving charge. Electric\nand magnetic effects are, in general,\ninseparable – hence the name electromagnetic\nforce. Like the gravitational force,\nelectromagnetic force acts over large distances\nand does not need any intervening medium. It\nis enormously strong compared to gravity. The\n\nelectric force between two protons, for example,\n\nis 10\n36\n\n times the gravitational force between\n\nthem, for any fixed distance.\n\nMatter, as we know, consists of elementary\n\ncharged constituents like electrons and\n\nprotons. Since the electromagnetic force is so\n\nmuch stronger than the gravitational force, it\n\ndominates all phenomena at atomic and\n\nmolecular scales.  (The other two forces, as we\n\nshall see, operate only at nuclear scales.)  Thus\n\nit is mainly the electromagnetic force that\n\ngoverns the structure of atoms and molecules,\n\nthe dynamics of  chemical reactions and the\n\nmechanical, thermal and other properties of\n\nmaterials.  It underlies the macroscopic forces\n\nlike  ‘tension’, ‘friction’, ‘normal force’, ‘spring\n\nforce’, etc.\n\nGravity is always attractive, while\n\nelectromagnetic force can be attractive or\n\nrepulsive.  Another way of putting it is that mass\n\ncomes only in one variety (there is no negative\n\nmass), but charge comes in two varieties :\n\npositive and negative charge. This is what\n\nmakes all the difference.  Matter is mostly\n\nelectrically neutral (net charge is zero). Thus,\n\nelectric force is largely zero and gravitational\n\nforce dominates terrestrial phenomena. Electric\n\nforce manifests itself in atmosphere where the\n\natoms are ionised and that leads to lightning.\n\nAlbert Einstein (1879-1955)\n\nAlbert Einstein, born in Ulm, Germany in 1879, is universally regarded as\none of the greatest physicists of all time. His astonishing scientific career\nbegan with the publication of three path-breaking papers in 1905.  In the\nfirst paper, he introduced the notion of light quanta (now called photons)\nand used it to explain the features of photoelectric effect that the classical\nwave theory of radiation could not account for.  In the second paper, he\ndeveloped a theory of Brownian motion that was confirmed experimentally\na few years later and provided a convincing evidence of the atomic picture of\nmatter. The third paper gave birth to the special theory of relativity that\n\nmade Einstein a legend in his own life time.  In the next decade, he explored the consequences of his\nnew theory which included, among other things, the mass-energy equivalence enshrined in his famous\nequation E = mc2.  He also created the general version of relativity (The General Theory of Relativity),\nwhich is the modern theory of gravitation. Some of Einstein’s most significant later contributions are:\nthe notion of stimulated emission introduced in an alternative derivation of Planck’s blackbody radiation\nlaw, static model of the universe which started modern cosmology, quantum statistics of a gas of\nmassive bosons, and a critical analysis of the foundations of quantum mechanics. The year 2005 was\ndeclared as International Year of  Physics, in recognition of  Einstein’s monumental contribution to\nphysics, in year 1905, describing revolutionary scientific ideas that have since influenced all of modern\nphysics.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICAL WORLD 9\n\nIf we reflect a little, the enormous strength\nof the electromagnetic force compared to\ngravity is evident in our daily life.  When we\nhold a book in our hand, we are balancing the\ngravitational force on the book due to the huge\nmass of the earth by the ‘normal force’\nprovided by our hand.  The latter is nothing\nbut the net electromagnetic force between the\ncharged constituents of our hand and\nthe book, at the surface in contact. If\nelectromagnetic force were not intrinsically so\nmuch stronger than gravity, the hand of the\nstrongest man would crumble under the\nweight of a feather ! Indeed, to be consistent,\nin that circumstance, we ourselves would\ncrumble under our own weight !\n\n1.4.3  Strong Nuclear Force\n\nThe strong nuclear force binds protons and\nneutrons in a nucleus. It is evident that without\nsome attractive force, a nucleus will be\nunstable due to the electric repulsion between\nits protons. This attractive force cannot be\ngravitational since force of gravity is negligible\ncompared to the electric force. A new basic force\nmust, therefore, be  invoked. The strong nuclear\nforce  is  the strongest of all fundamental forces,\nabout 100 times the electromagnetic force in\n\nstrength.  It is charge-independent and acts\nequally between a proton and a proton, a\nneutron and a neutron, and a proton and a\nneutron. Its range is, however, extremely small,\nof about nuclear dimensions (10\n\n–15\nm). It is\n\nresponsible for the stability of nuclei. The\nelectron, it must be noted, does not experience\nthis force.\n\nRecent developments have, however,\nindicated that protons and neutrons are built\nout of still more elementary constituents called\nquarks.\n\n1.4.4  Weak Nuclear Force\n\nThe weak nuclear force appears only in certain\n\nnuclear processes such as the β-decay of a\n\nnucleus. In β-decay, the nucleus emits an\n\nelectron and an uncharged particle called\n\nneutrino.  The weak nuclear force is not as weak\n\nas the gravitational force, but much weaker\n\nthan the strong nuclear and electromagnetic\n\nforces. The range of weak nuclear force is\n\nexceedingly small, of the order of 10\n–16 \n\nm.\n\n1.4.5  Towards Unification of  Forces\n\nWe remarked in section 1.1 that unification is a\nbasic quest in physics. Great advances in\nphysics often amount to unification of different\n\nSatyendranath Bose (1894-1974)\n\nSatyendranath Bose, born in Calcutta in 1894, is among the great Indian\nphysicists who made a fundamental contribution to the advance of science\nin the twentieth century. An outstanding student throughout, Bose started\nhis career in 1916 as a lecturer in physics in Calcutta University; five years\nlater he joined Dacca University.  Here in 1924, in a brilliant flash of insight,\nBose gave a new derivation of Planck’s law, treating radiation as a gas of\nphotons and employing new statistical methods of counting of photon states.\nHe wrote a short paper on the subject and sent it to Einstein who\nimmediately recognised its great significance, translated it in German and\nforwarded it for publication.  Einstein then applied the same method to a\n\ngas of molecules.\nThe key new conceptual ingredient in Bose’s work was that the particles were regarded as\n\nindistinguishable, a radical departure from the assumption that underlies the classical Maxwell-\nBoltzmann statistics. It was soon realised that the new Bose-Einstein statistics was applicable to\nparticles with integers spins, and a new quantum statistics (Fermi-Dirac statistics) was needed for\nparticles with half integers spins satisfying Pauli’s exclusion principle. Particles with integers spins\nare now known as bosons in honour of Bose.\n\nAn important consequence of Bose-Einstein statistics is that a gas of molecules below a certain\ntemperature will undergo a phase transition to a state where a large fraction of atoms populate the\nsame lowest energy state. Some seventy years were to pass before the pioneering ideas of Bose, developed\nfurther by Einstein, were dramatically confirmed in the observation of a new state of matter in a dilute\ngas of ultra cold alkali atoms - the Bose-Eintein  condensate.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS10\n\ntheories and domains. Newton unified terrestrial\nand celestial domains under a common law of\ngravitation.  The experimental discoveries of\nOersted and Faraday showed that electric and\nmagnetic phenomena are in general\ninseparable.  Maxwell unified electromagnetism\nand optics with the discovery that light is an\nelectromagnetic wave.  Einstein attempted to\nunify gravity and electromagnetism but could\nnot succeed in this venture. But this did not\ndeter physicists from zealously pursuing the\ngoal of unification of forces.\n\nRecent decades have seen much progress on\nthis front.  The electromagnetic and the weak\nnuclear force have now been unified and are\nseen as aspects of a single ‘electro-weak’ force.\nWhat this unification actually means cannot\nbe explained here. Attempts have been (and are\nbeing) made to unify the electro-weak and the\nstrong force and even to unify the gravitational\nforce with the rest of the fundamental forces.\nMany of these ideas are still speculative and\ninconclusive. Table 1.4 summarises some of the\nmilestones in the progress towards unification\nof forces in nature.\n\n1.5   NATURE OF PHYSICAL LAWS\n\nPhysicists explore the universe. Their\ninvestigations, based on scientific processes,\nrange from particles that are smaller than\natoms in size to stars that are very far away. In\naddition to finding the facts by observation and\nexperimentation, physicists attempt to discover\nthe laws that summarise (often as mathematical\nequations) these facts.\n\nIn any physical phenomenon governed by\ndifferent forces, several quantities may change\nwith time. A remarkable fact is that some special\nphysical quantities, however, remain constant\nin time. They are the conserved quantities of\nnature. Understanding these conservation\nprinciples is very important to describe the\nobserved phenomena quantitatively.\n\nFor motion under an external conservative\nforce, the total mechanical energy i.e. the sum\nof kinetic and potential energy of a body is a\nconstant. The familiar example is the free fall of\nan object under gravity. Both the kinetic energy\nof the object and its potential energy change\ncontinuously with time, but the sum remains\nfixed. If the object is released from rest, the initial\n\nTable 1.4  Progress in unification of different forces/domains in nature\n\nTable 1.3  Fundamental  forces  of  nature\n\nName Relative Range Operates among\nstrength\n\nGravitational force 10–39 Infinite All objects in the universe\n\nWeak nuclear force 10–13 Very short, Sub-nuclear Some elementary particles,\nsize (∼10–16m) particularly electron and\n\nneutrino\n\nElectromagnetic force 10–2 Infinite Charged particles\n\nStrong nuclear force 1 Short, nuclear Nucleons, heavier\nsize (∼10–15m) elementary particles\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICAL WORLD 11\n\npotential energy is completely converted into the\nkinetic energy of the object just before it hits\nthe ground. This law restricted for a conservative\nforce should not be confused with the general\nlaw of conservation of energy of an isolated\nsystem (which is the basis of the First Law of\nThermodynamics).\n\nThe concept of energy is central to physics\nand the expressions for energy can be written\nfor every physical system. When all forms of\nenergy e.g., heat, mechanical energy, electrical\nenergy etc., are counted, it turns out that energy\nis conserved. The general law of conservation of\nenergy is true for all forces and for any kind of\ntransformation between different forms of\nenergy. In the falling object example, if you\ninclude the effect of air resistance during the\nfall and see the situation after the object hits\nthe ground and stays there, the total\nmechanical energy is obviously not conserved.\nThe general law of energy conservation, however,\nis still applicable.  The initial potential energy\nof the stone gets transformed into other forms\nof energy : heat and sound. (Ultimately, sound\nafter it is absorbed becomes heat.) The total\nenergy of the system (stone plus the\nsurroundings) remains unchanged.\n\nThe law of conservation of energy is thought\nto be valid across all domains of nature, from\nthe microscopic to the macroscopic. It is\nroutinely applied in the analysis of atomic,\nnuclear and elementary particle processes.  At\n\nthe other end, all kinds of violent phenomena\noccur in the universe all the time.  Yet the total\nenergy of the universe (the most ideal isolated\nsystem possible !) is believed to remain\nunchanged.\n\nUntil the advent of Einstein’s theory of\nrelativity, the law of conservation of mass was\nregarded as another basic conservation law of\nnature, since matter was thought to be\nindestructible. It was (and still is) an important\nprinciple used, for example, in the analysis of\nchemical reactions. A chemical reaction is\nbasically a rearrangement of atoms among\ndifferent molecules.  If the total binding energy\nof the reacting molecules is less than the total\nbinding energy of the product molecules, the\ndifference appears as heat and the reaction is\nexothermic.  The opposite is true for energy\nabsorbing (endothermic) reactions.  However,\nsince the atoms are merely rearranged but not\ndestroyed, the total mass of the reactants is the\nsame as the total mass of the products in a\nchemical reaction. The changes in the binding\nenergy are too small to be measured as changes\nin mass.\n\nAccording to Einstein’s theory, mass m is\nequivalent to energy E given by the relation\nE = mc\n\n2\n, where c is speed of light in vacuum.\n\nIn a nuclear process mass gets converted to\nenergy (or vice-versa). This is the energy which\nis released in a nuclear power generation and\n\nnuclear explosions.\n\nSir C.V. Raman (1888-1970)\n\nChandrashekhara Venkata Raman  was born on 07 Nov 1888 in Thiruvanaikkaval.\nHe finished his schooling by the age of eleven. He graduated from Presidency\nCollege, Madras. After finishing his education he joined financial services of the\nIndian Government.\n\nWhile in Kolkata, he started working on his area of interest at Indian Asso-\nciation for Cultivation of Science founded  by Dr. Mahendra Lal Sirkar, during his\nevening hours. His area of interest included vibrations, variety of musical instru-\nments, ultrasonics, diffraction and so on.\n\nIn 1917 he was offered Professorship at Calcutta University. In 1924 he was\nelected ‘Fellow’ of the Royal Society of London and received Nobel prize in Physics\nin 1930 for his discovery, now known as Raman Effect.\n\nThe Raman Effect deals with scattering of light by molecules of a medium\nwhen they are excited to vibrational energy levels. This work opened totally new\navenues for research for years to come.\n\nHe spent his later years at Bangalore, first at Indian Institute of Science and then at Raman Re-\nsearch Institute. His work has inspired generation of young students.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS12\n\nEnergy is a scalar quantity.  But all conserved\n\nquantities are not necessarily scalars.  The total\n\nlinear momentum and the total angular\n\nmomentum (both vectors) of an isolated system\n\nare also conserved quantities.  These laws can\n\nbe derived from Newton’s laws of motion in\n\nmechanics.  But their validity goes beyond\n\nmechanics.  They are the basic conservation\n\nlaws of nature in all domains, even in those\n\nwhere Newton’s laws may not be valid.\n\nBesides their great simplicity and generality,\n\nthe conservation laws of nature are very useful\n\nin practice too.  It often happens that we cannot\n\nsolve the full dynamics of a complex problem\n\ninvolving different particles and forces. The\n\nconservation laws can still provide useful\n\nresults.  For example, we may not know the\n\ncomplicated forces that act during a collision\n\nof two automobiles; yet momentum\n\nconservation law enables us to bypass the\n\ncomplications and predict or rule out possible\n\noutcomes of the collision. In nuclear and\n\nelementary particle phenomena also, the\n\nconservation laws are important tools of\n\nanalysis.  Indeed, using the conservation laws\n\nof energy and momentum for β-decay, Wolfgang\n\nPauli (1900-1958) correctly predicted in 1931\n\nthe existence of a new particle (now called\n\nneutrino) emitted in β-decay along with the\n\nelectron.\n\nConservation laws have a deep connection\n\nwith symmetries of nature that you will explore\n\nin more advanced courses in physics.  For\n\nexample, an important observation is that the\n\nlaws of nature do not change with time!  If you\n\nperform an experiment in your laboratory today\n\nand repeat the same experiment (on the same\n\nobjects under identical conditions) after a year,\n\nthe results are bound to be the same.  It turns\n\nout that this symmetry of nature with respect to\n\ntranslation (i.e. displacement) in time is\n\nequivalent to the law of conservation of energy.\n\nLikewise, space is homogeneous and there is no\n\n(intrinsically) preferred location in the universe.\n\nTo put it more clearly, the laws of nature are the\n\nsame everywhere in the universe. (Caution : the\n\nphenomena may differ from place to place\n\nbecause of differing conditions at different\n\nlocations. For example, the acceleration due to\n\ngravity at the moon is one-sixth that at the earth,\n\nbut the law of gravitation is the same both on\nthe moon and the earth.)  This symmetry of the\n\nlaws of nature with respect to translation in\n\nspace gives rise to conservation of linear\n\nmomentum.  In the same way isotropy of space\n\n(no intrinsically preferred direction in space)\n\nunderlies the law of conservation of angular\n\nmomentum*. The conservation laws of charge and\nother attributes of elementary particles can also\n\nbe related to certain abstract symmetries.\n\nSymmetries of space and time and other abstract\n\nsymmetries play a central role in modern theories\n\nof fundamental forces in nature.\n\n* See Chapter 7\n\nConservation laws in physics\n\nConservation of energy, momentum, angular\nmomentum, charge, etc are considered to be\nfundamental laws in physics. At this moment,\nthere are many such conservation laws. Apart from\nthe above four, there are others which mostly deal\nwith quantities which have been introduced in\nnuclear and particle physics. Some of the\nconserved quantities are called spin, baryon\nnumber, strangeness, hypercharge, etc, but you\nneed not worry about them.\n\nA conservation law is a hypothesis, based on\nobservations and experiments. It is important to\nremember that a conservation law cannot be\nproved. It can be verified, or disproved, by\nexperiments. An experiment whose result is  in\nconformity with the law verifies or substantiates\nthe law; it does not prove the law. On the other\nhand, a single experiment whose result goes\nagainst the law is enough to disprove it.\n\nIt would be wrong to ask somebody to prove\nthe law of conservation of energy. This law is an\noutcome of our experience over several centuries,\nand it has been found to be valid in all\nexperiments, in mechanics, thermodynamics,\nelectromagnetism, optics, atomic and nuclear\nphysics, or any other area.\n\nSome students feel that they can prove the\nconservation of mechanical energy from a body\nfalling under gravity, by adding the kinetic and\npotential energies at a point and showing that it\nturns out to be constant. As pointed out above,\nthis is only a verification of the law, not its proof.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICAL WORLD 13\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. Physics deals with the study of the basic laws of nature and their manifestation in\ndifferent phenomena. The basic laws of physics are universal and apply in widely different\ncontexts and conditions.\n\n2. The scope of physics is wide, covering a tremendous range of magnitude of physical\nquantities.\n\n3. Physics and technology are related to each other.  Sometimes technology gives rise to\nnew physics; at other times physics generates new technology.  Both have direct impact\non society.\n\n4. There are four fundamental forces in nature that govern the diverse phenomena of the\nmacroscopic and the microscopic world. These are the ‘gravitational force’, the\n‘electromagnetic force’, the ‘strong nuclear force’, and the ‘weak nuclear force’.  Unification\nof different forces/domains in nature is a basic quest in physics.\n\n5. The physical quantities that remain unchanged in a process are called conserved\nquantities. Some of the general conservation laws in nature include the laws of\nconservation of mass, energy, linear momentum, angular momentum, charge, parity,\netc.  Some conservation laws are true for one fundamental force but not for the other.\n\n6. Conservation laws have a deep connection with symmetries of nature.  Symmetries of\nspace and time, and other types of symmetries play a central role in modern theories of\nfundamental forces in nature.\n\nEXERCISES\n\nNote for the student\n\nThe exercises given here are meant to enhance your awareness about the issues surrounding\nscience, technology and society and to encourage you to think and formulate your views\nabout them.  The questions may not have clear-cut ‘objective’ answers.\n\nNote for the teacher\n\nThe exercises given here are not  for the purpose of a formal examination.\n\n1.1 Some of the most profound statements on the nature of science have come from\nAlbert Einstein, one of the greatest scientists of all time.  What do you think did\nEinstein mean when he said :  “The most incomprehensible thing about the world is\nthat it is comprehensible”?\n\n1.2 “Every great physical theory starts as a heresy and ends as a dogma”. Give some\nexamples from the history of science of the validity of this incisive remark.\n\n1.3 “Politics is the art of the possible”. Similarly, “Science is the art of the soluble”.\nExplain this beautiful aphorism on the nature and practice of science.\n\n1.4 Though India now has a large base in science and technology, which is fast expanding,\nit is still a long way from realising its potential of becoming a world leader in science.\nName some important factors, which in your view have hindered the advancement of\nscience in India.\n\n1.5 No physicist has ever “seen” an electron.  Yet, all physicists believe in the existence of\nelectrons.  An intelligent but superstitious man advances this analogy to argue that\n‘ghosts’ exist even though no one has ‘seen’ one.  How will you refute his argument ?\n\n1.6 The shells of crabs found around a particular coastal location in Japan seem mostly\nto resemble the legendary face of a Samurai.  Given below are two explanations of this\nobserved fact.  Which of these strikes you as a scientific explanation ?\n\n(a) A tragic sea accident several centuries ago drowned a young Samurai. As a tribute\nto his bravery, nature through its inscrutable ways immortalised his face by\nimprinting it on the crab shells in that area.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS14\n\n(b) After the sea tragedy, fishermen in that  area, in a gesture of honour to their\ndead hero, let free any crab shell caught by them which accidentally had a shape\nresembling the face of a Samurai.  Consequently, the particular shape  of the\ncrab shell survived longer and therefore in course of time the shape was genetically\npropagated.  This is an example of evolution by artificial selection.\n\n[Note : This interesting illustration taken from Carl Sagan’s ‘The Cosmos’ highlights\nthe fact that often strange and inexplicable facts which on the first sight appear\n‘supernatural’ actually turn out to have simple scientific explanations. Try to think\nout other examples of this kind].\n\n1.7 The industrial revolution in England and Western Europe more than two centuries\nago was triggered by some key scientific and technological advances.  What were these\nadvances ?\n\n1.8 It is often said that the world is witnessing now a second industrial revolution, which\nwill transform the society as radically as did the first. List some key contemporary areas\nof science and technology, which are responsible for this revolution.\n\n1.9 Write in about 1000 words a fiction piece based on your speculation on the science\nand technology of the twenty-second century.\n\n1.10 Attempt to formulate your ‘moral’ views on the practice of science.  Imagine yourself\nstumbling upon a discovery, which has great academic interest but is certain to have\nnothing but dangerous consequences for the human society.  How, if at all, will you\nresolve your dilemma ?\n\n1.11 Science, like any knowledge, can be put to good or bad use, depending on the user.\nGiven below are some of the applications of science.  Formulate your views on whether\nthe particular application is good, bad or something that cannot be so clearly\ncategorised :\n(a) Mass vaccination against small pox to curb and finally eradicate this disease\n\nfrom the population. (This has already been successfully done in India).\n(b) Television for eradication of illiteracy and for mass communication of news and\n\nideas.\n(c) Prenatal sex determination\n(d) Computers for increase in work efficiency\n(e) Putting artificial satellites into orbits  around the Earth\n(f ) Development of nuclear weapons\n(g) Development of new and powerful techniques of chemical and biological warfare).\n(h) Purification of water for drinking\n(i) Plastic surgery\n(j ) Cloning\n\n1.12 India has had a long and unbroken tradition of great scholarship — in mathematics,\nastronomy, linguistics, logic and ethics.  Yet, in parallel with this, several superstitious\nand obscurantistic  attitudes and practices flourished in our society and unfortunately\ncontinue even today — among many educated people too. How will you use your\nknowledge of science to develop strategies to counter these attitudes ?\n\n1.13 Though the law gives women equal status in India, many people hold unscientific\nviews on a woman’s innate nature, capacity and intelligence, and in practice give\nthem a secondary status and role. Demolish this view using scientific arguments, and\nby quoting examples of great women in science and other spheres; and persuade yourself\nand others that, given equal opportunity, women are on par with men.\n\n1.14 “It is more important to have beauty in the equations of physics than to have them\nagree with experiments”. The great British physicist P. A. M. Dirac held this view.\nCriticize this statement.  Look out for some equations and results in this book which\nstrike you as beautiful.\n\n1.15 Though the statement quoted above may be disputed, most physicists do have a feeling\nthat the great laws of physics are at once simple and beautiful. Some of the notable\nphysicists, besides Dirac, who have articulated this feeling, are : Einstein, Bohr,\nHeisenberg, Chandrasekhar and Feynman. You are urged to make special efforts to get\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICAL WORLD 15\n\naccess to the general books and writings by these and other great masters of physics.\n(See the Bibliography at the end of this book.) Their writings are truly inspiring !\n\n1.16 Textbooks on science may give you a wrong impression that studying science is dry\nand all too serious and that scientists are absent-minded introverts who never laugh\nor grin.  This image of science and scientists is patently false. Scientists, like any\nother group of humans, have their share of humorists, and many have led their lives\nwith a great sense of fun and adventure, even as they seriously pursued their scientific\nwork. Two great physicists of this genre are Gamow and Feynman. You will enjoy\nreading their books listed in the Bibliography.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2.pmd\n\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nUNITS AND MEASUREMENT\n\n2.1  INTRODUCTION\n\nMeasurement of any physical quantity involves comparison\nwith a certain basic, arbitrarily chosen, internationally\naccepted reference standard called unit. The result of a\nmeasurement of a physical quantity is expressed by a\nnumber (or numerical measure) accompanied by a unit.\nAlthough the number of physical quantities appears to be\nvery large, we need only a limited number of units for\nexpressing all the physical quantities, since they are inter-\nrelated with one another. The units for the fundamental or\nbase quantities are called fundamental or base units. The\nunits of all other physical quantities can be expressed as\ncombinations of the base units. Such units obtained for the\nderived quantities are called derived units. A complete set\nof these units, both the base units and derived units, is\nknown as the system of units.\n\n2.2  THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM OF UNITS\nIn earlier time scientists of different countries were using\ndifferent systems of units for measurement. Three such\nsystems, the CGS, the FPS (or British) system and the MKS\nsystem were in use extensively till recently.\n\nThe base units for length, mass and time in these systems\nwere as follows :\n• In CGS system they were centimetre, gram and second\n\nrespectively.\n• In FPS system they were foot, pound and second\n\nrespectively.\n• In MKS system they were metre, kilogram and second\n\nrespectively.\nThe system of units which is at present internationally\n\naccepted for measurement is the Système Internationale\nd’ Unites (French for International System of Units),\nabbreviated as SI. The SI, with standard scheme of symbols,\nunits and abbreviations, developed by the Bureau\nInternational des Poids et measures (The International\nBureau of Weights and Measures, BIPM) in 1971 were\nrecently revised by the General Conference on Weights and\nMeasures in November 2018. The scheme is now for\n\n2.1 Introduction\n\n2.2 The international system of\nunits\n\n2.3 Measurement of length\n\n2.4 Measurement of mass\n\n2.5 Measurement of time\n\n2.6 Accuracy, precision of\ninstruments and errors in\nmeasurement\n\n2.7 Significant figures\n\n2.8 Dimensions of physical\nquantities\n\n2.9 Dimensional formulae and\ndimensional equations\n\n2.10 Dimensional analysis and its\napplications\n\nSummary\nExercises\nAdditional exercises\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTable 2.1   SI Base Quantities  and  Units*\n\ninternational usage in scientific, technical, industrial\nand commercial work.  Because SI units used decimal\nsystem, conversions within the system are quite simple\nand convenient.  We shall follow the SI units in this\nbook.\n\nIn SI, there are seven base units as given in Table\n2.1. Besides the seven base units, there are two more\nunits that are defined for (a) plane angle dθ as the ratio\nof length of arc ds to the radius r and (b) solid angle dΩ\nas the ratio of the intercepted area dA of the spherical\nsurface, described about the apex O as the centre, to\nthe square of its radius r, as shown in Fig. 2.1(a) and\n(b) respectively.  The unit for plane angle is radian with\nthe symbol rad and the unit for the solid angle is\nsteradian with the symbol sr. Both these are\ndimensionless quantities.\n\nUNITS AND MEASUREMENT 17\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\nFig. 2.1 Description of (a) plane angle dθ\n\nand (b) solid angle dΩ .\n\nBase                                                        SI Units\n\nquantity Name Symbol Definition\n\nLength metre m The metre, symbol m, is the SI unit of length. It is defined by taking the\nfixed numerical value of the speed of light in vacuum c to be 299792458\nwhen expressed in the unit m s–1, where the second is defined in terms of\nthe caesium frequency ∆νcs.\n\nMass kilogram kg The kilogram, symbol kg, is the SI unit of mass. It is defined by taking the\nfixed numerical value of the Planck constant h to be 6.62607015×10–34 when\nexpressed in the unit J s, which is equal to kg m2 s–1, where the metre and\nthe second are defined in terms of c and ∆νcs.\n\nTime second s The second, symbol s, is the SI unit of time. It is defined by taking the fixed\nnumerical value of the caesium frequency ∆νcs, the unperturbed ground-\nstate hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium-133 atom, to be\n9192631770 when expressed in the unit Hz, which is equal to s–1.\n\nElectric ampere A The ampere, symbol A, is the SI unit of electric current. It is defined by\ntaking the fixed numerical value of the elementary charge e to be\n1.602176634×10–19 when expressed in the unit C, which is equal to A s,\nwhere the second is defined in terms of ∆νcs.\n\nThermo kelvin K The kelvin, symbol K, is the SI unit of thermodynamic temperature.\ndynamic It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the Boltzmann constant\nTemperature k to be 1.380649×10–23 when expressed in the unit J K–1, which is equal to\n\nkg m2 s–2 k–1, where the kilogram, metre and second are defined in terms of\nh, c and ∆νcs.\n\nAmount of mole mol The mole, symbol mol, is the SI unit of amount of substance. One mole\nsubstance contains exactly 6.02214076×1023 elementary entities. This number is the\n\nfixed numerical value of the Avogadro constant, N\nA\n, when expressed in the\n\nunit mol–1 and is called the Avogadro number. The amount of substance,\nsymbol n, of a system is a measure of the number of specified elementary\nentities. An elementary entity may be an atom, a molecule, an ion, an electron,\nany other particle or specified group of particles.\n\nLuminous candela cd The candela, symbol cd, is the SI unit of luminous intensity in given direction.\nintensity It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the luminous efficacy of\n\nmonochromatic radiation of frequency 540×1012 Hz, K\ncd\n, to be 683 when expressed\n\nin the unit lm W–1, which is equal to cd sr W–1, or cd sr kg–1m–2s3, where the\nkilogram, metre and second are defined in terms of h, c and ∆νcs.\n\n* The values mentioned here need not be remembered or asked in a test. They are given here only to\nindicate the extent of accuracy to which they are measured. With progress in technology, the measuring\n\ntechniques get improved leading to measurements with greater precision. The definitions of base units\n\nare revised to keep up with this progress.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS18\n\nTable 2.2   Some units retained for general use (Though outside SI)\n\nNote that when mole is used, the elementary\nentities  must  be specified.  These  entities\nmay be atoms, molecules, ions, electrons,\nother particles or specified groups of such\nparticles.\n\nWe employ units  for  some  physical quantities\nthat can be derived from the seven base units\n(Appendix A 6). Some derived units in terms of\nthe SI base units are given in (Appendix A 6.1).\nSome SI derived units are given special names\n(Appendix A  6.2 ) and some derived SI units make\nuse of these units with special names and the\nseven base units  (Appendix A 6.3). These are\ngiven in Appendix A 6.2 and A 6.3 for your ready\nreference. Other units retained for general use\nare given in Table 2.2.\n\nCommon SI prefixes and symbols for multiples\nand sub-multiples are given in Appendix A2.\nGeneral  guidelines for using symbols for physical\nquantities, chemical elements and nuclides are\ngiven in Appendix A7 and those for SI units and\nsome other units  are given in Appendix A8 for\nyour guidance and ready reference.\n\n2.3  MEASUREMENT OF LENGTH\n\nYou are already familiar with some direct methods\nfor the measurement of length.  For example, a\nmetre scale is used for lengths from 10–3 m to 102\n\nm.  A vernier callipers is used for lengths to an\naccuracy of 10–4 m.  A screw gauge and a\nspherometer can be used to measure lengths as\nless as to 10–5 m. To measure lengths beyond these\nranges, we make use of some special indirect\nmethods.\n\n2.3.1  Measurement of Large Distances\n\nLarge distances such as the distance of a planet\nor a star from the earth cannot be measured\ndirectly with a metre scale. An important method\nin such cases is the parallax method.\n\nWhen you hold a pencil in front of you against\nsome specific point on the background (a wall)\nand look at the pencil first through your left eye\nA (closing the right eye) and then look at the\npencil through your right eye B (closing the left\neye), you would notice that the position of the\npencil seems to change with respect to the point\non the wall.  This is called parallax.  The\ndistance between the two points of observation\nis called the basis. In this example, the basis is\nthe distance between the eyes.\n\nTo measure the distance D of a far away\nplanet S by the parallax method, we observe it\nfrom two different positions (observatories) A and\nB on the  Earth,  separated  by distance AB = b\nat the same time as shown in Fig. 2.2.  We\nmeasure the angle between the two directions\nalong which the planet is viewed at these two\npoints. The ∠ASB in Fig. 2.2 represented by\nsymbol θ is called the parallax angle or\nparallactic angle.\n\nAs the planet is very far away,  1,\nb\n\nD\n<<  and\n\ntherefore, θ  is very small.  Then we\napproximately take AB as an arc of length b of a\ncircle with centre at S and the distance D as\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nUNITS AND MEASUREMENT 19\n\n\uf074\n\n\uf074\n\n\uf074\n\n\uf074\n\nthe radius  AS = BS so that AB = b = D θ  where\nθ  is in radians.\n\n   D =  \nb\n\nθ\n(2.1)\n\nHaving determined D, we can employ a similar\nmethod to determine the size or angular diameter\nof the planet. If d is the diameter of the planet\nand α  the angular size of the planet (the angle\nsubtended by d at the earth), we have\n\nα = d/D (2.2)\nThe angle α  can be measured from the same\n\nlocation on the earth.  It is the angle between\nthe two directions when two diametrically\nopposite  points  of the planet are viewed through\nthe telescope.  Since D is known, the diameter d\nof the planet can be determined using Eq. (2.2).\n\nExample 2.1  Calculate the angle of\n(a) 10 (degree) (b) 1′ (minute of arc or arcmin)\nand (c) 1″(second of arc or arc second) in\nradians. Use 3600=2π rad, 10=60′ and\n1′ = 60 ″\n\nAnswer  (a) We have 3600 = 2π rad\n10 = (π /180) rad = 1.745×10–2 rad\n\n(b) 10 = 60′ = 1.745×10–2 rad\n1′ = 2.908×10–4 rad \uf001  2.91×10–4 rad\n\n(c) 1′ = 60″ = 2.908×10–4 rad\n1″ = 4.847×10–4 rad \uf001  4.85×10–6 rad \uf074\n\nExample 2.2  A man wishes to estimate\nthe distance of a nearby tower from him.\nHe stands at a point A in front of the tower\nC and spots a very distant object O in line\nwith AC. He then walks perpendicular to\nAC up to B, a distance of 100 m, and looks\nat O and C again. Since O is very distant,\nthe direction BO is practically the same as\n\nAO; but he finds the line of sight of C shifted\nfrom the original line of sight by an angle θ\n= 400  (θ is known as ‘parallax’) estimate\nthe distance of the tower C from his original\nposition A.\n\nFig. 2.3\n\nAnswer  We have, parallax angle θ  = 400\nFrom Fig. 2.3, AB = AC tan θ\nAC = AB/tanθ  = 100 m/tan 400\n= 100 m/0.8391 = 119 m \uf074\n\nExample 2.3  The moon is observed from\ntwo diametrically opposite points A and B\non Earth.  The angle θ  subtended at the\nmoon by the two directions of observation\nis 1o 54′. Given the diameter of the Earth to\nbe about 1.276 ×××××     107 m, compute the\ndistance of the moon from the Earth.\n\nAnswer  We have θ  = 1° 54′ = 114′\n\n( ) ( )-6114 60 4.85 10= ′′× × ×   rad\n=  3.32 ×\n\n−\n10\n\n2\nrad,\n\nsince  \n61 4.85 10 .=" rad−×\n\nAlso  b = AB =1.276 m×107\n\nHence from Eq.

We cannot use a screw gauge\nor similar instruments. Even a microscope has\ncertain limitations.  An optical microscope uses\nvisible light to ‘look’ at the system under\ninvestigation.  As light has wave like features,\nthe resolution to which an optical microscope\ncan be used is the wavelength of light (A detailed\nexplanation can be found in the Class XII\nPhysics textbook). For visible light the range of\nwavelengths  is from about 4000 Å to 7000 Å\n(1 angstrom = 1 Å = 10-10 m). Hence an optical\nmicroscope cannot resolve particles with sizes\nsmaller than this. Instead of visible light, we can\nuse an electron beam.  Electron beams can be\nfocussed by properly designed electric and\nmagnetic fields. The resolution of such an\nelectron microscope is limited finally by the fact\nthat electrons can also behave as waves ! (You\nwill learn more about this in class XII). The\nwavelength of an electron can be as small as a\nfraction of an angstrom.  Such electron\nmicroscopes with a resolution of 0.6 Å have been\nbuilt. They can almost resolve atoms and\nmolecules in a material. In recent times,\ntunnelling microscopy has been developed in\nwhich again the limit of resolution is better than\nan angstrom. It is possible to estimate the sizes\nof molecules.\n\nA simple method for estimating the molecular\nsize of oleic acid is given below. Oleic acid is a\nsoapy liquid with large molecular size of the\norder of 10–9 m.\n\nThe idea is to first form mono-molecular layer\nof oleic acid on water surface.\n\nWe dissolve 1 cm3 of oleic acid in alcohol to\nmake a solution of 20 cm3. Then we take 1 cm3\n\nof this solution and dilute it to 20 cm3, using\nalcohol. So, the concentration of the solution is\n\nequal to \n1\n\n20 20\n3\n\n×\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\ncm  of oleic acid/cm3 of\n\nsolution. Next we lightly sprinkle some\nlycopodium powder on the surface of water in a\nlarge trough and we put one drop of this solution\nin the water. The oleic acid drop spreads into a\nthin, large and roughly circular film of molecular\nthickness on water surface. Then, we quickly\nmeasure the diameter of the thin film to get its\narea A. Suppose we have dropped n drops in\nthe water. Initially, we determine the\napproximate volume of each drop (V cm3).\n\nVolume of n drops of solution\n                             = nV cm3\n\nAmount of oleic acid in this solution\n\n                             = nV \n1\n\n20 20×\n\n\uf001\n\n\uf005\n\uf003\n\n\uf002\n\n\uf006\n\uf004 cm\n\n3\n\nThis solution of oleic acid spreads very fast\non the surface of water and forms a very thin\nlayer of thickness t.  If this spreads to form a\nfilm of area A cm2, then the thickness of the\nfilm\n\nt =\nVolume of the film\n\nArea of the film\n\nor, cm20 20 \nnV\n\nt\nA\n\n=\n× (2.3)\n\nIf we assume that the film has mono-molecular\nthickness, then this becomes the size or diameter\nof a molecule of oleic acid. The value of this\nthickness comes out to be of the order of 10–9 m.\n\nExample 2.5  If the size of a nucleus (in\nthe range of 10–15 to 10–14 m) is scaled up\nto the tip of a sharp pin, what roughly is\nthe size of an atom ? Assume tip of the pin\nto be in the range 10–5m to 10–4m.\n\nAnswer  The size of a nucleus is in the range of\n10–15 m and 10–14 m.  The tip of a sharp pin is\ntaken to be in the range of 10–5 m and 10–4 m.\nThus we are scaling up by a factor of 1010. An\natom roughly of size 10–10 m will be scaled up to a\nsize of 1 m. Thus a nucleus in an atom is as small\nin size as the tip of a sharp pin placed at the centre\nof a sphere of radius about a metre long. \uf074\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nUNITS AND MEASUREMENT 21\n\n2.3.3  Range of Lengths\n\nThe sizes of the objects we come across in the\nuniverse vary over a very wide range. These may\nvary from the size of the order of 10–14 m of the\ntiny nucleus of an atom to the size of the order\nof 1026 m of the extent of the observable universe.\nTable 2.3 gives the range and order of lengths\nand sizes of some of these objects.\n\nWe also use certain special length units for\nshort and large lengths. These are\n1 fermi = 1 f = 10–15 m\n1 angstrom = 1 Å = 10–10 m\n1 astronomical unit = 1 AU (average distance\n\n    of the Sun from the Earth)\n= 1.496 × 1011 m\n\n1 light year = 1 ly= 9.46 × 1015 m (distance\n   that light travels with velocity of\n\n   3 × 108 m s–1 in 1 year)\n1 parsec = 3.08 × 1016 m (Parsec is the\ndistance at which average radius of earth’s orbit\nsubtends an angle of 1 arc second)\n\n2.4  MEASUREMENT OF MASS\n\nMass is a basic property of matter.  It does not\ndepend on the temperature, pressure or location\nof the object in space. The SI unit of mass is\nkilogram (kg). It is defined by taking the fixed\nnumerical value of the Plank Constant h to be\n6.62607015×10–34 when expressed in the unit of\nJs which is equal to kg m2s–1, where the\nmetre and the second are defined is terms of C\nand ∆νcs.\n\nWhile dealing with atoms and molecules, the\nkilogram is an inconvenient unit. In this case,\nthere is an important standard unit of mass,\ncalled the unified atomic mass unit (u), which\nhas been established for expressing the mass\nof atoms as\n\n1 unified atomic mass unit = 1u\n    = (1/12) of the mass of an atom of  carbon-12\nisotope ( )612 C  including the mass  of electrons\n    = 1.66 × 10–27  kg\n\nMass of commonly available objects can be\ndetermined by a common balance like the one\nused in a grocery shop. Large masses in the\nuniverse like planets, stars, etc., based on\nNewton’s law of gravitation can be measured by\nusing gravitational method (See Chapter 8). For\nmeasurement of small masses of atomic/sub-\natomic particles etc., we make use of mass\nspectrograph in which radius of the trajectory\nis proportional to the mass of a charged particle\nmoving in uniform  electric and magnetic field.\n\n2.4.1  Range of  Masses\n\nThe masses of the objects, we come across in\nthe universe, vary over a very wide range.  These\nmay vary from tiny  mass of the order of 10-30 kg\nof an electron to the huge mass of about 1055 kg\nof the known universe. Table 2.4 gives the range\nand order of the typical masses of various\nobjects.\n\nTable 2.3  Range and order of lengths\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS22\n\nTable 2.4  Range and order of masses\n\n2.5   MEASUREMENT OF TIME\nTo measure any time interval we need a clock.\nWe now use an atomic standard of time, which\nis based on the periodic vibrations produced in\na cesium atom. This is the basis of the caesium\nclock, sometimes called atomic clock, used in\nthe national standards. Such standards are\navailable in many laboratories. In the caesium\natomic clock, the second is taken as the time\nneeded for 9,192,631,770 vibrations of the\nradiation corresponding to the transition\nbetween the two hyperfine levels of the ground\nstate of caesium-133 atom. The vibrations of the\ncaesium atom regulate the rate of this caesium\natomic clock just as the vibrations of a balance\nwheel regulate an ordinary wristwatch or the\nvibrations of a small quartz crystal regulate a\nquartz wristwatch.\n\nThe caesium atomic clocks are very accurate.\nIn principle they provide portable standard.  The\nnational standard of time interval ‘second’ as\nwell as the frequency is maintained through four\ncesium atomic clocks.  A caesium atomic clock\nis used at the National Physical Laboratory\n(NPL), New Delhi to  maintain the Indian\nstandard of time.\n\nIn our country, the NPL has the responsibility\nof maintenance and improvement of physical\nstandards, including that of time, frequency, etc.\nNote that the Indian Standard Time (IST) is\nlinked to this set of atomic clocks. The efficient\ncaesium atomic clocks are so accurate that they\nimpart the uncertainty in time realisation as\n\n± 1 × 10–15, i.e. 1 part in 1015.  This implies that\nthe uncertainty gained over time by such a\ndevice is less than 1 part in 1015; they lose or\ngain no more than 32 µs in one year. In view of\nthe tremendous accuracy in time measurement,\nthe SI unit of length has been expressed in terms\nthe path length light travels in certain interval\nof time (1/299, 792, 458 of a second) (Table 2.1).\n\nThe time interval of events that we come\nacross in the universe vary over a very wide\nrange. Table 2.5 gives the range and order of\nsome typical time intervals.\n\nYou may notice that there is an interesting\ncoincidence between the numbers appearing\nin Tables 2.3 and 2.5. Note that the ratio of the\nlongest and shortest lengths of objects in our\nuniverse is about 1041. Interestingly enough,\nthe ratio of the longest and shortest time\nintervals associated with the events and objects\nin our universe is also about 1041. This number,\n1041 comes up again in Table 2.4, which lists\ntypical masses of objects. The ratio of the\nlargest and smallest masses of the objects in\nour universe is about (1041)2. Is this a curious\ncoincidence between these large numbers\npurely accidental ?\n\n2.6 ACCURACY, PRECISION OF INSTRUMENTS\nAND ERRORS IN MEASUREMENT\n\nMeasurement is the foundation of all\nexperimental science and technology. The result\nof every measurement by any measuring\ninstrument contains some uncertainty. This\nuncertainty is called error. Every calculated\nquantity which is based on measured values,\nalso has an error. We shall distinguish between\ntwo terms: accuracy and precision. The\naccuracy of a measurement is a measure of how\nclose the measured value is to the true value of\nthe quantity. Precision tells us to what resolution\nor limit the quantity is measured.\n\nThe accuracy in measurement may depend on\nseveral factors, including the limit or the resolution\nof the measuring instrument. For example, suppose\nthe true value of a certain length is near 3.678 cm.\nIn one experiment, using a measuring instrument\nof resolution 0.1 cm, the measured value is found to\nbe 3.5 cm, while in another experiment using a\nmeasuring device of greater resolution, say 0.01 cm,\nthe length is determined to be 3.38 cm. The first\nmeasurement has more accuracy (because it is\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nUNITS AND MEASUREMENT 23\n\ncloser to the true value) but less precision (its\nresolution is only 0.1 cm), while the\nsecond measurement is less accurate but\nmore precise. Thus every measurement is\napproximate due to errors in measurement. In\ngeneral, the errors in measurement can be\nbroadly classified as (a) systematic errors and\n(b) random errors.\n\nSystematic errors\n\nThe systematic errors are those errors that\ntend to be in one direction, either positive or\nnegative. Some of the sources of systematic\nerrors are :\n\n(a) Instrumental errors that arise from the\nerrors due to imperfect design or calibration\nof the measuring instrument, zero error in\nthe instrument, etc. For example, the\ntemperature graduations of a thermometer\nmay be inadequately calibrated (it may read\n104 °C at the boiling point of water at STP\nwhereas it should read 100 °C); in a vernier\ncallipers the zero mark of vernier scale may\nnot coincide with the zero mark of the main\nscale, or simply an ordinary metre scale may\nbe worn off at one end.\n\n(b) Imperfection in experimental technique\nor procedure To determine the temperature\n\nof a human body, a thermometer placed\nunder the armpit will always give a\ntemperature lower than the actual value of\nthe body temperature. Other external\nconditions (such as changes in temperature,\nhumidity, wind velocity, etc.) during the\nexperiment may systematically affect the\nmeasurement.\n\n(c) Personal errors that arise due to an\nindividual’s bias, lack of proper setting of\nthe apparatus or individual’s carelessness\nin taking observations without observing\nproper precautions, etc. For example, if you,\nby habit, always hold your head a bit too far\nto the right while reading the position of a\nneedle on the scale, you will introduce an\nerror due to parallax.\n\nSystematic errors can be minimised by\nimproving experimental techniques, selecting\nbetter instruments and removing personal bias\nas far as possible. For a given set-up, these\nerrors may be estimated to a certain extent and\nthe necessary corrections may be applied to the\nreadings.\n\nRandom errors\n\nThe random errors are those errors, which occur\nirregularly and hence are random with respect\n\nTable 2.5   Range and order of time intervals\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS24\n\nto sign and size. These can arise due to random\nand unpredictable fluctuations in experimental\nconditions (e.g. unpredictable fluctuations in\ntemperature, voltage supply, mechanical\nvibrations of experimental set-ups, etc), personal\n(unbiased) errors by the observer taking\nreadings, etc. For example, when the same\nperson repeats the same observation, it is very\nlikely that he may get different readings\neverytime.\n\nLeast count error\n\nThe smallest value that can be measured by the\nmeasuring instrument is called its least count.\nAll the readings or measured values are good only\nup to this value.\n\nThe least count error is the error\nassociated with the resolution of the instrument.\nFor example, a vernier callipers has the least\ncount as 0.01cm; a spherometer may have a\nleast count of 0.001 cm. Least count error\nbelongs to the category of random errors but\nwithin a limited size; it occurs with both\nsystematic and random errors. If we use a metre\nscale for measurement of length, it may have\ngraduations at 1 mm division scale spacing or\ninterval.\n\nUsing instruments of higher precision,\nimproving experimental techniques, etc., we can\nreduce the least count error. Repeating the\nobservations several times and taking the\narithmetic mean of all the observations, the\nmean value would be very close to the true value\nof the measured quantity.\n\n2.6.1 Absolute Error, Relative Error and\nPercentage Error\n\n(a) Suppose the values obtained in several\nmeasurements are a\n\n1\n, a\n\n2\n, a\n\n3\n...., a\n\nn\n.  The\n\narithmetic mean of these values is taken as\nthe best possible value of the quantity under\nthe given conditions of measurement as :\n\na\nmean\n\n = (a\n1\n+a\n\n2\n+a\n\n3\n+...+a\n\nn\n ) / n (2.4)\n\nor,\n\na a / n\nmean i\n\ni 1\n\nn\n\n=\n=\n\uf007 (2.5)\n\nThis is because, as explained earlier, it is\nreasonable to suppose that individual\nmeasurements are as likely to overestimate\n\nas to underestimate the true value of the\nquantity.\n\nThe magnitude of the difference\n\nbetween the individual measurement and\n\nthe true value of the quantity is called the\n\nabsolute error of the measurement. This\nis denoted by |∆a |. In absence of any other\nmethod of knowing true value, we considered\narithmatic mean as the true value.  Then the\nerrors in the individual measurement values\nfrom the true value, are\n\n∆a\n1\n  = a\n\n1\n – a\n\nmean\n,\n\n∆a\n2\n  = a\n\n2\n – a\n\nmean\n,\n\n....      ....      ....\n\n....      ....      ....\n∆a \n\nn\n = a\n\nn\n – a\n\nmean\n\nThe ∆a calculated above may be positive in\ncertain cases and negative in some other\ncases. But absolute error |∆a| will always\nbe positive.\n\n(b) The arithmetic mean of all the absolute errors\nis taken as the final or mean absolute error\nof the value of the physical quantity a. It is\nrepresented by ∆a\n\nmean\n.\n\nThus,\n\n∆a\nmean\n\n = (|∆a\n1\n|+|∆a\n\n2\n |+|∆a\n\n3\n|+...+ |∆a\n\nn\n|)/n\n\n(2.6)\n\n=\n=\n\uf007\ni 1\n\nn\n\n|∆a\ni\n|/n (2.7)\n\nIf we do a single measurement, the value we\nget may be in the range a\n\nmean\n ±  ∆a\n\nmean\n\ni.e.      a = a\nmean\n\n ±  ∆a\nmean\n\nor,\n     a\n\nmean\n – ∆a\n\nmean\n ≤ a  ≤ a\n\nmean\n + ∆a\n\nmean\n\n(2.8)\n\nThis implies that any measurement of the\nphysical quantity a is likely to lie between\n\n(a\nmean\n\n+ ∆a\nmean\n\n)  and  (a\nmean\n\n− ∆a\nmean\n\n).\n(c) Instead of the absolute error, we often use\n\nthe relative error or the percentage error\n(δa).  The relative error is the ratio of the\nmean absolute error ∆∆∆∆∆a\n\nmean\n to the mean\n\nvalue a\nmean \n\nof the quantity measured.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nUNITS AND MEASUREMENT 25\n\n\uf074\n\n\uf074\n\nRelative error = ∆a\nmean\n\n/a\nmean\n\n(2.9)\n\nWhen the relative error is expressed in per\ncent, it is called the percentage error (δa).\n\nThus, Percentage error\n\nδa = (∆a\nmean\n\n/a\nmean\n\n) × 100% (2.10)\n\nLet us now consider an example.\n\nExample 2.6  Two clocks are being tested\nagainst a standard clock located in a\nnational laboratory.  At 12:00:00 noon by\nthe standard clock, the readings of the two\nclocks are :\n\nClock 1 Clock 2\n\nMonday 12:00:05 10:15:06\nTuesday 12:01:15 10:14:59\nWednesday 11:59:08 10:15:18\nThursday 12:01:50 10:15:07\nFriday 11:59:15 10:14:53\nSaturday 12:01:30 10:15:24\nSunday 12:01:19 10:15:11\n\nIf you are doing an experiment that requires\nprecision time interval measurements, which\nof the two clocks will you prefer ?\n\nAnswer   The range of variation over the seven\ndays of observations is 162 s for clock 1, and\n31 s for clock 2.  The average reading of clock 1\nis much closer to the standard time than the\naverage reading of clock 2.  The important point\nis that a clock’s zero error is not as significant\nfor precision work as its variation, because a\n‘zero-error’ can always be easily corrected.\nHence clock 2 is to be preferred to clock 1. \uf020\uf020\uf074\n\nExample 2.7  We measure the period of\noscillation of a simple pendulum.  In\nsuccessive measurements, the readings\nturn out to be 2.63 s, 2.56 s, 2.42 s, 2.71s\nand 2.80 s. Calculate the absolute errors,\nrelative error or percentage error.\n\nAnswer   The mean period of oscillation of the\npendulum\n\n( )\nT =\n\n+ + + +2.63 2.56 2.42 2.71 2.80 s\n\n5\n\n= \n13.12\n\n5\n s\n\n= 2.624  s\n= 2.62  s\n\nAs the periods are measured to a resolution\nof 0.01 s, all times are to the second decimal; it\nis proper to put this mean period also to the\nsecond decimal.\n\nThe errors in the measurements are\n\n2.63 s – 2.62 s =   0.01 s\n2.56 s – 2.62 s = – 0.06 s\n2.42 s – 2.62 s = – 0.20 s\n2.71 s – 2.62 s =    0.09 s\n2.80 s – 2.62 s =    0.18 s\n\nNote that the errors have the same units as the\nquantity to be measured.\n\nThe arithmetic mean of all the absolute errors\n(for arithmetic mean, we take only the\nmagnitudes) is\n\n∆Τ\nmean\n\n = [(0.01+ 0.06+0.20+0.09+0.18)s]/5\n              = 0.54 s/5\n              = 0.11 s\n\nThat means, the period of oscillation of the\nsimple pendulum is (2.62 ± 0.11) s i.e. it lies\nbetween (2.62 + 0.11) s and (2.62 – 0.11) s or\nbetween 2.73 s and 2.51 s.  As the arithmetic\nmean of all the absolute errors is 0.11 s, there\nis already an error in the tenth of a second.\nHence there is no point in giving the period to a\nhundredth.  A more correct way will be to write\n\n             T = 2.6 ± 0.1 s\n\nNote that the last numeral 6 is unreliable, since\nit may be anything between 5 and 7. We indicate\nthis by saying that the measurement has two\nsignificant figures. In this case, the two\nsignificant figures are 2, which is reliable and\n6, which has an error associated with it.  You\nwill learn more about the significant figures in\nsection 2.7.\n\nFor this example, the relative error or the\npercentage error is\n\nδa = × =\n01\n\n100 4\n.\n\n2.6\n%              \uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf074\n\n2.6.2  Combination of Errors\n\nIf we do an experiment involving several\nmeasurements, we must know how the errors\nin all the measurements combine.  For example,\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS26\n\n\uf074\n\nmass density is obtained by deviding mass by\nthe volume of the substance. If we have errors\nin the measurement of mass and of the sizes or\ndimensions, we must know what the error will\nbe in the density of the substance. To make such\nestimates, we should learn how errors combine\nin various mathematical operations. For this,\nwe use the following procedure.\n\n(a)  Error of a sum or a difference\n\nSuppose two physical quantities A and B have\nmeasured values A ± ∆A, B ± ∆B respectively\nwhere ∆A and ∆B are their absolute errors. We\nwish to find the error ∆Z in the sum\n\nZ = A + B.\nWe have by addition, Z ± ∆Z\n\n= (A ± ∆A) + (B ± ∆B).\nThe maximum possible error in Z\n\n∆Z = ∆A + ∆B\nFor the difference Z = A – B,  we have\n                    Z ± ∆ Z =  (A ± ∆A) – (B ± ∆B)\n                                = (A – B) ± ∆A ± ∆B\n\nor, ± ∆Z =  ± ∆A ± ∆B\nThe maximum value of the error ∆Z  is again\n∆A + ∆B.\n\nHence the rule : When two quantities are\nadded or subtracted, the absolute error in the\n\nfinal result is the sum of the absolute errors\n\nin the individual quantities.\n\nExample 2.8  The temperatures of two\nbodies measured by a thermometer are\nt\n1\n = 20 0C ± 0.5 0C and t\n\n2\n = 50 0C ± 0.5 0C.\n\nCalculate the temperature difference and\nthe error theirin.\n\nAnswer  t′ = t\n2\n–t\n\n1\n = (50 0C±0.5 0C)– (200C±0.5 0C)\n\n t′ = 30 0C ± 1 0C \uf074\n(b)  Error of a product or a quotient\n\nSuppose Z = AB and the measured values of A\nand B are A ± ∆A and B ± ∆B. Then\n\nZ ± ∆Z = (A ± ∆A)  (B ± ∆B)\n                     = AB ± B ∆A ± A ∆B ± ∆A ∆B.\n\nDividing LHS by Z and RHS by AB we have,\n\n1±(∆Z/Z) = 1 ± (∆A/A) ± (∆B/B) ± (∆A/A)(∆B/B).\n\nSince ∆A and ∆B are small, we shall ignore their\nproduct.\n\nHence the maximum relative error\n\n∆Z/ Z = (∆A/A) + (∆B/B).\nYou can easily verify that this is true for division\nalso.\n\nHence the rule : When two quantities are\nmultiplied or divided, the relative error in the\nresult is the sum of the relative errors in the\nmultipliers.\n\nHow will you measure the length of a line?\n\nWhat a naïve question, at this stage, you might\nsay! But what if it is not a straight line? Draw\na zigzag line in your copy, or on the blackboard.\nWell, not too difficult again. You might take a\nthread, place it along the line, open up the\nthread, and measure its length.\n\nNow imagine that you want to measure the\nlength of a national highway, a river, the railway\ntrack between two stations, or the boundary\nbetween two states or two nations. If you take\na string of length 1 metre or 100 metre, keep it\nalong the line, shift its position every time, the\narithmetic of man-hours of labour and expenses\non the project is not commensurate with the\noutcome. Moreover, errors are bound to occur\nin this enormous task. There is an interesting\nfact about this. France and Belgium share a\ncommon international boundary, whose length\nmentioned in the official documents of the two\ncountries differs substantially!\n\nGo one step beyond and imagine the\ncoastline where land meets sea. Roads and rivers\nhave fairly mild bends as compared to a\ncoastline. Even so, all documents, including our\nschool books, contain information on the length\nof the coastline of Gujarat or Andhra Pradesh,\nor the common boundary between two states,\netc. Railway tickets come with the distance\nbetween stations printed on them. We have\n‘milestones’ all along the roads indicating the\ndistances to various towns. So, how is it done?\n\nOne has to decide how much error one can\ntolerate and optimise cost-effectiveness. If you\nwant smaller errors, it will involve high\ntechnology and high costs. Suffice it to say that\nit requires fairly advanced level of physics,\nmathematics, engineering and technology. It\nbelongs to the areas of fractals, which has lately\nbecome popular in theoretical physics. Even\nthen one doesn’t know how much to rely on\nthe figure that props up, as is clear from the\nstory of France and Belgium. Incidentally, this\nstory of the France-Belgium discrepancy\nappears on the first page of an advanced Physics\nbook on the subject of fractals and chaos!\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nUNITS AND MEASUREMENT 27\n\n\uf074\n\n\uf074\n\n\uf074\n\n\uf074\n\nExample 2.9  The resistance R = V/I where\nV = (100 ± 5)V and I = (10 ± 0.2)A.

Thus, the result of\nmeasurement should be reported in a way that\nindicates the precision of measurement.\nNormally, the reported result of measurement\nis a number that includes all digits in the\nnumber that are known reliably plus the first\ndigit that is uncertain. The reliable digits plus\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS28\n\nthe first uncertain digit are known as\nsignificant digits or significant figures. If we\nsay the period of oscillation of a simple\npendulum is 1.62 s, the digits 1 and 6 are\nreliable and certain, while the digit 2 is\nuncertain. Thus, the measured value has three\nsignificant figures. The length of an object\nreported after measurement to be 287.5 cm has\nfour significant figures, the digits 2, 8, 7 are\ncertain while the digit 5 is uncertain. Clearly,\nreporting the result of measurement that\nincludes more digits than the significant digits\nis superfluous and also misleading since it would\ngive a wrong idea about the precision of\nmeasurement.\n\nThe rules for determining the number of\nsignificant figures can be understood from the\nfollowing examples. Significant figures indicate,\nas already mentioned, the precision of\nmeasurement which depends on the least count\nof the measuring instrument. A choice of\nchange of different units does not change the\nnumber of significant digits or figures in a\nmeasurement. This important remark makes\nmost of the following observations clear:\n(1) For example, the length 2.308 cm has four\nsignificant figures. But in different units, the\nsame value can be written as 0.02308 m or 23.08\nmm or 23080 µm.\n\nAll these numbers have the same number of\nsignificant figures (digits 2, 3, 0, 8), namely four.\nThis shows that the location of decimal point is\nof no consequence in determining the number\nof significant figures.\nThe example gives the following rules :\n• All the non-zero digits are significant.\n• All the zeros between two non-zero digits\n\nare significant, no matter where the\ndecimal point is, if at all.\n\n• If the number is less than 1, the zero(s)\non the right of decimal point but to the\nleft of the first non-zero digit are not\nsignificant. [In 0.00 2308, the underlined\nzeroes are not significant].\n\n• The terminal or trailing zero(s) in a\nnumber without a decimal point are not\nsignificant.\n\n[Thus 123 m = 12300 cm = 123000 mm has\nthree significant figures, the trailing zero(s)\nbeing not significant.] However, you can also\nsee the next observation.\n\n• The trailing zero(s) in a number with a\ndecimal point are significant.\n[The numbers 3.500 or 0.06900 have four\nsignificant figures each.]\n\n(2) There can be some confusion regarding the\ntrailing zero(s). Suppose a length is reported to\nbe 4.700 m. It is evident that the zeroes here\nare meant to convey the precision of\nmeasurement and are, therefore, significant. [If\nthese were not, it would be superfluous to write\nthem explicitly, the reported measurement\nwould have been simply 4.7 m]. Now suppose\nwe change units, then\n\n4.700 m = 470.0 cm = 4700 mm = 0.004700 km\n\nSince the last number has trailing zero(s) in a\nnumber with no decimal, we would conclude\nerroneously from observation (1) above that the\nnumber has two significant figures, while in\nfact, it has four significant figures and a mere\nchange of units cannot change the number of\nsignificant figures.\n\n(3) To remove such ambiguities in\ndetermining the number of significant\nfigures, the best way is to report every\nmeasurement in scientific notation (in the\npower of 10). In this notation, every number is\nexpressed as a × 10b, where a is a number\nbetween 1 and 10, and b is any positive or\nnegative exponent (or power) of 10.  In order to\nget an approximate idea of the number, we may\nround off the number a to 1 (for a ≤ 5) and to 10\n(for 5<a ≤ 10). Then the number can be\nexpressed approximately as 10b in which the\nexponent (or power) b of 10 is called order of\nmagnitude of the physical quantity. When only\nan estimate is required, the quantity is of the\norder of 10b. For example, the diameter of the\nearth (1.28×107m) is of the order of 107m with\nthe order of magnitude 7. The diameter of\nhydrogen atom (1.06 ×10–10m) is of the order of\n10–10m, with the order of magnitude\n–10. Thus, the diameter of the earth is 17 orders\nof magnitude larger than the hydrogen atom.\n\nIt is often customary to write the decimal after\nthe first digit. Now the confusion mentioned in\n(a) above disappears :\n\n 4.700 m = 4.700 × 102 cm\n        = 4.700 × 103 mm = 4.700 × 10–3 km\n\nThe power of 10 is irrelevant to the\ndetermination of significant figures. However, all\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nUNITS AND MEASUREMENT 29\n\nzeroes appearing in the base number in the\nscientific notation are significant. Each number\nin this case has four significant figures.\n\nThus, in the scientific notation, no confusion\narises about the trailing zero(s) in the base\nnumber a. They are always significant.\n\n(4) The scientific notation is ideal for reporting\nmeasurement. But if this is not adopted, we use\nthe rules adopted in the preceding example :\n• For a number greater than 1, without any\n\ndecimal, the trailing zero(s) are not\nsignificant.\n\n• For a number with a decimal, the trailing\n\nzero(s) are significant.\n\n(5) The digit 0 conventionally put on the left of a\ndecimal for a number less than 1 (like 0.1250)\nis never significant. However, the zeroes at the\nend of such number are significant in a\nmeasurement.\n\n(6) The multiplying or dividing factors which are\nneither rounded numbers nor numbers\nrepresenting measured values are exact and\nhave infinite number of significant digits. For\n\nexample in \n2\nd\n\nr =  or  s = 2πr, the factor 2 is an\n\nexact number and it can be written as 2.0, 2.00\n\nor 2.0000 as required. Similarly, in \nt\n\nT\nn\n\n= , n is\n\nan exact number.\n\n2.7.1 Rules for Arithmetic Operations with\nSignificant Figures\n\nThe result of a calculation involving approximate\nmeasured values of quantities (i.e. values with\nlimited number of significant figures) must reflect\nthe uncertainties in the original measured values.\nIt cannot be more accurate than the original\nmeasured values themselves on which the result\nis based. In general, the final result should not\nhave more significant figures than the original\ndata from which it was obtained. Thus, if mass of\nan object is measured to be, say, 4.237 g (four\nsignificant figures) and its volume is measured to\nbe 2.51 cm3, then its density, by mere arithmetic\ndivision, is 1.68804780876 g/cm3 upto 11 decimal\nplaces. It would be clearly absurd and irrelevant\nto record the calculated value of density to such a\nprecision when the measurements on which the\nvalue is based, have much less precision. The\n\nfollowing rules for arithmetic operations with\nsignificant figures ensure that the final result of\na calculation is shown with the precision that is\nconsistent with the precision of the input\nmeasured values :\n(1)  In multiplication or division, the final\nresult should retain as many significant\nfigures as are there in the original number\nwith the least significant figures.\n\nThus, in the example above, density should\nbe reported to three significant figures.\n\nDensity\n4.237g\n\n2.51 cm\n1.69 g cm\n\n3\n-3\n\n= =\n\nSimilarly,  if the speed of light is given as\n3 × 108 m s-1 (one significant figure) and one\nyear (1y = 365.25 d) has 3.1557 × 107 s (five\nsignificant figures), the light year is 9.47 × 1015 m\n(three significant figures).\n\n(2) In addition or subtraction, the final result\nshould retain as many decimal places as are\nthere in the number with the least decimal\nplaces.\n\nFor example, the sum of the numbers\n436.32 g, 227.2 g and 0.301 g by mere arithmetic\naddition,  is 663.821 g. But the least precise\nmeasurement (227.2 g) is correct to only one\ndecimal place. The final result should, therefore,\nbe rounded off to 663.8 g.\n\nSimilarly, the difference in length can be\nexpressed as :\n\n0.307 m – 0.304 m = 0.003 m = 3 × 10–3 m.\n\nNote that we should not use the rule (1)\napplicable for multiplication and division and\nwrite 664 g as the result in the example of\naddition and 3.00 × 10–3 m in the example of\nsubtraction. They do not convey the precision\nof measurement properly. For addition and\nsubtraction, the rule is in terms of decimal\nplaces.\n\n2.7.2   Rounding off the Uncertain Digits\n\nThe result of computation with approximate\nnumbers, which contain more than one\nuncertain digit, should be rounded off.  The rules\nfor rounding off numbers to the appropriate\nsignificant figures are obvious in most cases.  A\nnumber 2.746 rounded off to three significant\nfigures is 2.75, while the number 2.743 would\nbe 2.74.  The rule by convention is that the\npreceding digit is raised by 1 if the\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS30\n\n\uf074\n\n\uf074\n\ninsignificant digit to be dropped (the\n\nunderlined digit in this case)  is more than\n\n5, and is left  unchanged if the latter is less\n\nthan 5.  But what if the number is 2.745 in\nwhich the insignificant digit is 5.  Here, the\nconvention is that if the preceding digit is\neven, the insignificant digit is simply\n\ndropped and, if it is odd, the preceding digit\n\nis raised by 1. Then, the number 2.745 rounded\noff to three significant figures becomes 2.74.  On\nthe other hand, the number 2.735 rounded off\nto three significant figures becomes 2.74 since\nthe preceding digit is odd.\n\nIn any involved or complex multi-step\ncalculation, you should retain, in intermediate\nsteps, one digit more than the significant digits\nand round off to proper significant figures at the\nend of the calculation.  Similarly, a number\nknown to be within many significant figures,\nsuch as in 2.99792458  × 108 m/s for the speed\nof light in vacuum, is rounded off to an\napproximate value 3 × 108 m/s , which is often\nemployed in computations.  Finally, remember\nthat exact numbers that appear in formulae like\n\n2 π in T\nL\n\ng\n= 2π ,  have a large (infinite) number\n\nof significant figures. The value of π =\n3.1415926.... is known to a large number of\nsignificant figures. You may take the  value as\n3.142 or 3.14 for π, with limited number of\nsignificant figures as required in specific\ncases.\n\nExample 2.13  Each side of a cube is\nmeasured to be 7.203 m.  What are the\ntotal surface area and the volume of the\ncube to appropriate significant figures?\n\nAnswer   The number of significant figures in\nthe measured length is 4.  The calculated area\nand the volume should therefore be rounded off\nto 4 significant figures.\n\nSurface area of the cube = 6(7.203)2 m2\n\n= 311.299254 m2\n\n= 311.3 m2\n\nVolume of the cube = (7.203)3  m3\n\n= 373.714754 m3\n\n= 373.7 m3 \uf074\n\nExample 2.14  5.74 g of a substance\noccupies 1.2 cm3.  Express its density by\nkeeping the significant figures in view.\n\nAnswer  There are 3 significant figures in the\nmeasured mass whereas there are only 2\nsignificant figures in the measured  volume.\nHence the density should be expressed to only\n2 significant figures.\n\nDensity = −\n5.74\n1.2\n\ng cm 3\n\n                       = 4.8 g cm--3 . \uf020\uf020\uf074\n\n2.7.3 Rules for Determining the Uncertainty\nin the Results of Arithmatic\nCalculations\n\nThe rules for determining the uncertainty or\nerror in the number/measured quantity in\narithmetic operations can be understood from\nthe following examples.\n(1) If the length and breadth of a thin\nrectangular sheet are measured, using a metre\nscale as 16.2 cm and, 10.1 cm respectively, there\nare three significant figures in each\nmeasurement.  It means that the length l may\nbe written as\n\n                       l = 16.2 ± 0.1  cm\n\n      = 16.2 cm ± 0.6 %.\n\nSimilarly, the breadth b may be written as\n\nb = 10.1  ± 0.1 cm\n\n   = 10.1 cm ± 1 %\n\nThen, the error of the product of two (or more)\nexperimental values, using the combination of\nerrors rule, will be\n\n    l b = 163.62 cm2 + 1.6%\n\n         = 163.62 + 2.6 cm2\n\nThis leads us to quote the final result as\n\nl b = 164 + 3 cm2\n\nHere 3 cm2 is the uncertainty or error in the\nestimation of area of rectangular sheet.\n\n(2) If a set of experimental data is specified\nto n significant figures, a result obtained by\ncombining the data will also be valid to n\nsignificant figures.\n\nHowever, if data are subtracted, the number of\nsignificant figures can be reduced.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nUNITS AND MEASUREMENT 31\n\nFor example, 12.9 g – 7.06 g, both specified to three\nsignificant figures, cannot properly be evaluated\nas 5.84 g but only as 5.8 g, as uncertainties in\nsubtraction or addition combine in a different\nfashion (smallest number of decimal places rather\nthan the number of significant figures in any of\nthe number added or subtracted).\n\n(3) The relative error of a value of number\nspecified to significant figures depends not\nonly on n but also on the number itself.\n\nFor example,  the accuracy  in measurement of\nmass 1.02 g is ± 0.01 g  whereas another\nmeasurement 9.89 g is also accurate to  ± 0.01 g.\nThe relative error in 1.02 g is\n\n= (± 0.01/1.02) × 100 %\n= ± 1%\n\nSimilarly, the relative error in 9.89 g  is\n= (± 0.01/9.89) × 100 %\n\n                   = ± 0.1 %\nFinally, remember that intermediate results in\na multi-step computation should be\n\ncalculated to one more significant figure in\n\nevery measurement than the number of\n\ndigits in the least precise measurement.\n\nThese should be justified by the data and then\nthe arithmetic operations may be carried out;\notherwise rounding errors can build up. For\nexample, the reciprocal of 9.58, calculated (after\nrounding off) to the same number of significant\nfigures (three) is 0.104, but the reciprocal of\n0.104 calculated to three significant figures is\n9.62.  However, if we had written 1/9.58 = 0.1044\nand then taken the reciprocal to three significant\nfigures, we would have retrieved the original\nvalue of 9.58.\n\nThis example justifies the idea to retain one\nmore extra digit (than the number of digits in\nthe least precise measurement) in intermediate\nsteps of the complex multi-step calculations in\norder to avoid additional errors in the process\nof rounding off the numbers.\n\n2.8  DIMENSIONS OF PHYSICAL QUANTITIES\n\nThe nature of a physical quantity is described\nby its dimensions. All the physical quantities\nrepresented by derived units can be expressed\nin terms of some combination of seven\nfundamental or base quantities. We shall call\nthese base quantities as the seven dimensions\nof the physical world, which are denoted with\n\nsquare brackets [ ]. Thus, length has the\ndimension [L], mass [M], time [T], electric current\n[A], thermodynamic temperature [K], luminous\nintensity [cd], and amount of substance [mol].\nThe dimensions of a physical quantity are the\npowers (or exponents) to which the base\nquantities are raised to represent that\nquantity. Note that using the square brackets\n[  ] round a quantity means that we are dealing\nwith ‘the dimensions of’ the quantity.\n\nIn mechanics, all the physical quantities can\nbe written in terms of the dimensions [L], [M]\nand [T]. For example, the volume occupied by\nan object is expressed as the product of length,\nbreadth and height, or three lengths. Hence the\ndimensions of volume are [L] × [L] × [L] = [L]3 = [L3].\nAs the volume is independent of mass and time,\nit is said to possess zero dimension in mass [M°],\nzero dimension in time [T°] and three\ndimensions in length.\n\nSimilarly, force, as the product of mass and\nacceleration, can be expressed as\nForce   = mass × acceleration\n\n= mass × (length)/(time)2\n\nThe dimensions of force are [M] [L]/[T]2 =\n[M L T–2]. Thus, the force has one dimension in\nmass, one dimension in length, and –2\ndimensions in time. The dimensions in all other\nbase quantities are zero.\n\nNote that in this type of representation, the\nmagnitudes are not considered. It is the quality\nof the type of the physical quantity that enters.\nThus, a change in velocity, initial velocity,\naverage velocity, final velocity, and speed are\nall equivalent in this context. Since all these\nquantities can be expressed as length/time,\ntheir dimensions are [L]/[T] or [L T–1].\n\n2.9 DIMENSIONAL FORMULAE AND\nDIMENSIONAL EQUATIONS\n\nThe expression which shows how and which of\nthe base quantities represent the dimensions\nof a physical quantity is called the dimensional\nformula of the given physical quantity. For\nexample, the dimensional formula of the volume\nis [M° L3 T°],  and  that of speed or velocity is\n[M° L T-1]. Similarly, [M° L T–2] is the dimensional\nformula of acceleration and [M L–3 T°] that of\nmass density.\n\nAn equation obtained by equating a physical\nquantity with its dimensional formula is called\nthe dimensional equation of the physical\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS32\n\nquantity.  Thus, the dimensional equations are\nthe equations, which represent the dimensions\nof a physical quantity in terms of the base\nquantities. For example, the dimensional\nequations of volume [V ],  speed [v], force [F ] and\nmass density [ρ] may be expressed as\n\n[V] = [M0 L3 T0]\n[v] = [M0 L T–1]\n[F] = [M L T–2]\n[ρ] = [M L–3 T0]\nThe dimensional equation can be obtained\n\nfrom the equation representing the relations\nbetween the physical quantities. The\ndimensional formulae of a large number and\nwide variety of physical quantities, derived from\nthe equations representing the relationships\namong other physical quantities and expressed\nin terms of base quantities are given in\nAppendix 9 for your guidance and ready\nreference.\n\n2.10 DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS AND ITS\nAPPLICATIONS\n\nThe recognition of concepts of dimensions, which\nguide the description of physical behaviour is\nof basic importance as only those physical\nquantities can be added or subtracted which\nhave the same dimensions.  A thorough\nunderstanding of dimensional analysis helps us\nin deducing certain relations among different\nphysical quantities and checking the derivation,\naccuracy and dimensional consistency or\nhomogeneity of various mathematical\nexpressions.  When magnitudes of two or more\nphysical quantities are multiplied, their units\nshould be treated in the same manner as\nordinary algebraic symbols. We can cancel\nidentical units in the numerator and\ndenominator.  The same is true for dimensions\nof a physical quantity.  Similarly, physical\nquantities represented by symbols on both sides\nof a mathematical equation must have the same\ndimensions.\n\n2.10.1 Checking the Dimensional\nConsistency of Equations\n\nThe magnitudes of physical quantities may be\nadded together or subtracted from one another\nonly if they have the same dimensions.  In other\nwords, we can add or subtract similar physical\nquantities. Thus, velocity cannot be added to\nforce, or an electric current cannot be subtracted\n\nfrom the thermodynamic temperature. This\nsimple principle called the principle of\nhomogeneity of dimensions in an equation is\nextremely useful in checking the correctness of\nan equation.  If the dimensions of all the terms\nare not same, the equation is wrong.  Hence, if\nwe derive an expression for the length (or\ndistance) of an object, regardless of the symbols\nappearing in the original mathematical relation,\nwhen all the individual dimensions are\nsimplified, the remaining dimension must be\nthat of length.  Similarly, if we derive an equation\nof speed, the dimensions on both the sides of\nequation, when simplified, must be of length/\ntime, or [L T–1].\n\nDimensions are customarily used as a\npreliminary test of the consistency of an\nequation, when there is some doubt about the\ncorrectness of the equation. However, the\ndimensional consistency does not guarantee\ncorrect equations. It is uncertain to the extent\nof dimensionless quantities or functions. The\narguments of special functions, such as the\ntrigonometric, logarithmic and exponential\nfunctions must be dimensionless. A pure\nnumber, ratio of similar physical quantities,\nsuch as angle as the ratio (length/length),\nrefractive index as the ratio (speed of light in\nvacuum/speed of light in medium) etc., has no\ndimensions.\n\nNow we can test the dimensional consistency\nor homogeneity of the equation\n\n( ) 21/2  0 0x x v  t a t= + +\nfor the distance x travelled by a particle or body\nin time t which starts from the position x\n\n0\n with\n\nan initial velocity v\n0\n at time t = 0 and has uniform\n\nacceleration a along the direction of motion.\nThe dimensions of each term may be written as\n\n                 [x] = [L]\n               [x\n\n0\n ] = [L]\n\n             [v\n0\n t] = [L T–1]  [T]\n\n                     = [L]\n       [(1/2) a t2] = [L T–2] [T2]\n                     = [L]\nAs each term on the right hand side of this\nequation has the same dimension, namely that\nof length, which is same as the dimension of\nleft hand side of the equation, hence this\nequation is a dimensionally correct equation.\n\nIt may be noted that a test of consistency of\ndimensions tells us no more and no less than a\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nUNITS AND MEASUREMENT 33\n\n\uf074\n\n\uf074\n\n\uf074\n\ntest of consistency of units, but has the\nadvantage that we need not commit ourselves\nto a particular choice of units, and we need not\nworry about conversions among multiples and\nsub-multiples of the units.  It may be borne in\nmind that if an equation fails this consistency\ntest, it is proved wrong, but if it passes, it is\nnot proved right.  Thus, a dimensionally correct\nequation need not be actually an exact\n(correct) equation, but a dimensionally wrong\n(incorrect) or inconsistent equation must be\nwrong.\n\nExample 2.15  Let us consider an equation\n\n      \n1\n\n2\nm v m g h\n\n2 =\n\nwhere m is the mass of the body, v its\nvelocity, g  is the acceleration due to\ngravity and h is the height.  Check\nwhether this equation is dimensionally\ncorrect.\n\nAnswer  The dimensions of LHS are\n             [M]  [L T–1 ]2 = [M] [ L2 T–2]\n\n         = [M L2 T–2]\n\nThe dimensions of RHS are\n           [M][L T–2]  [L] = [M][L2 T–2]\n\n         = [M L2 T–2]\n\nThe dimensions of LHS and RHS are the same and\nhence the equation is dimensionally correct. \uf074\n\nExample 2.16   The SI unit of energy is\nJ =  kg m2 s–2; that of speed v is  m s–1 and\nof acceleration a is   m s–2.  Which of the\nformulae for kinetic energy (K) given below\ncan you rule out on the basis of\ndimensional arguments (m stands for the\nmass of the body) :\n(a) K = m2 v3\n\n(b) K = (1/2)mv2\n\n(c) K = ma\n(d) K = (3/16)mv2\n\n(e) K = (1/2)mv2 + ma\n\nAnswer   Every correct formula or equation must\nhave the same dimensions on both sides of the\nequation.  Also, only quantities with the same\nphysical dimensions can be added or\nsubtracted.  The dimensions of the quantity on\nthe right side are [M2 L3 T–3] for (a);  [M L2 T–2] for\n\n(b) and (d); [M L T–2] for (c).  The quantity on the\nright side of (e) has no proper dimensions since\ntwo quantities of different dimensions have been\nadded.  Since the kinetic energy K has the\ndimensions of [M L2 T–2], formulas (a), (c) and (e)\nare ruled out.  Note that dimensional arguments\ncannot tell which of the two, (b) or (d), is the\ncorrect formula.  For this, one must turn to the\nactual definition of kinetic energy (see Chapter\n6).  The correct formula for kinetic energy is given\nby (b). \uf074\n\n2.10.2 Deducing Relation among the\nPhysical Quantities\n\nThe method of dimensions can sometimes be\nused to deduce relation among the physical\nquantities. For this we should know the\ndependence of the physical quantity on other\nquantities (upto three physical quantities or\nlinearly independent variables) and consider it\nas a product type of the dependence. Let us take\nan example.\n\nExample 2.17 Consider a simple\npendulum, having a bob attached to a\nstring, that oscillates under the action of\nthe force of gravity. Suppose that the period\nof oscillation of the simple pendulum\ndepends on its length  (l), mass of the bob\n(m) and acceleration due to gravity (g).\nDerive the expression for its time period\nusing method of dimensions.\n\nAnswer  The dependence of time period T on\nthe  quantities l, g and m as a product may be\nwritten as :\n\nT = k lx gy mz\n\nwhere k is dimensionless constant and x, y\nand z are the exponents.\n\nBy considering dimensions on both sides, we\nhave\n\no o 1 1 1 –2 1[L M T ]=[L ] [L T ] [M ]x y z\n\n= Lx+y T–2y  Mz\n\nOn equating the dimensions on both sides,\nwe have\n\nx + y = 0; –2y = 1; and z = 0\n\nSo that \n1 1\n\n, – , 0\n2 2\n\nx y z= = =\n\nThen, T = k l½ g–½\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS34\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. Physics is a quantitative science, based on measurement of physical quantities.  Certain\nphysical quantities have been chosen as fundamental or base quantities (such as length,\nmass, time, electric current, thermodynamic temperature, amount of substance, and\nluminous intensity).\n\n2. Each base quantity is defined in terms of a certain basic, arbitrarily chosen but properly\nstandardised reference standard called unit (such as metre, kilogram, second, ampere,\nkelvin, mole and candela).  The units for the fundamental or base quantities are called\nfundamental or base units.\n\n3. Other physical quantities, derived from the base quantities, can be expressed as a\ncombination of the base units and are called derived units.  A complete set of units,\nboth fundamental and derived, is called a system of units.\n\n4. The International System of Units (SI) based on seven base units is at present\ninternationally accepted unit system and is widely used throughout the world.\n\n5. The SI units are used in all physical measurements, for both the base quantities and\nthe derived quantities obtained from them.  Certain derived units are expressed by\nmeans of SI units with special names (such as joule, newton, watt, etc).\n\n6. The SI units have well defined and internationally accepted unit symbols (such as m for\nmetre, kg for kilogram, s for second, A for ampere, N for newton etc.).\n\n7. Physical measurements are usually expressed for small and large quantities in scientific\nnotation, with powers of 10.  Scientific notation and the prefixes are used to simplify\nmeasurement notation and numerical computation, giving indication to the precision\nof the numbers.\n\n8. Certain general rules and guidelines must be followed for using notations for physical\nquantities and standard symbols for SI units, some other units and SI prefixes for\nexpressing properly the physical quantities and measurements.\n\n9. In computing any physical quantity, the units for derived quantities involved in the\nrelationship(s) are treated as though they were algebraic quantities till the desired\nunits are obtained.\n\n10. Direct and indirect methods can be used for the measurement of physical quantities.\nIn measured quantities, while expressing the result, the accuracy and precision of\nmeasuring instruments along with errors in measurements should be taken into account.\n\n11. In measured and computed quantities proper significant figures only should be retained.\nRules for determining the number of significant figures, carrying out arithmetic\noperations with them, and ‘rounding off ‘ the uncertain digits must be followed.\n\n12. The dimensions of base quantities and combination of these dimensions describe the\nnature of physical quantities. Dimensional analysis can be used to check the dimensional\nconsistency of equations, deducing relations among the physical quantities, etc. A\ndimensionally consistent equation need not be actually an exact (correct) equation,\nbut a dimensionally wrong or inconsistent equation must be wrong.\n\nor, T = \nl\n\nk\ng\n\nNote that value of constant k can not be obtained\nby the method of dimensions. Here it does not\nmatter if some number multiplies the right side\nof this formula, because that does not affect its\ndimensions.\n\nActually, k = 2π so that T = 2\nl\n\ng\nπ \uf074\n\nDimensional analysis is very useful in deducing\nrelations among the interdependent physical\nquantities. However, dimensionless constants\ncannot be obtained by this method. The method\nof dimensions can only test the dimensional\nvalidity, but not  the exact relationship between\nphysical quantities in any equation. It does not\ndistinguish between the physical quantities\nhaving same dimensions.\n\nA number of exercises at the end of this\nchapter will help you develop skill in\ndimensional analysis.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nUNITS AND MEASUREMENT 35\n\nEXERCISES\n\nNote : In stating numerical answers, take care of significant figures.\n2.1 Fill in the blanks\n\n(a) The volume of a cube of side 1 cm is equal to .....m3\n\n(b) The surface area of a solid cylinder of radius 2.0 cm and height 10.0 cm is equal to\n      ...(mm)2\n\n(c)  A vehicle moving with a speed of 18 km h–1 covers....m in 1 s\n(d) The relative density of lead is 11.3.

Suppose we employ a system of units in which the unit of mass equals α\nkg, the unit of length equals β m, the unit of time is γ s.  Show that a calorie has a\nmagnitude 4.2 α –1 β –2 γ 2 in terms of the new units.\n\n2.4 Explain this statement clearly :\n“To call a dimensional quantity ‘large’ or ‘small’ is meaningless without specifying a\nstandard for comparison”. In view of this, reframe the following statements wherever\nnecessary :\n(a) atoms are very small objects\n(b) a jet plane moves with great speed\n(c) the mass of Jupiter is very large\n(d) the air inside this room contains a large number of molecules\n(e) a proton is much more massive than an electron\n(f) the speed of sound is much smaller than the speed of light.\n\n2.5 A new unit of length is chosen such that the speed of light in vacuum is unity. What\nis the distance between the Sun and the Earth in terms of the new unit if light takes\n8 min and 20 s to cover this distance ?\n\n2.6 Which of the following is the most precise device for measuring length :\n(a) a vernier callipers with 20 divisions on the sliding scale\n(b) a screw gauge of pitch 1 mm and 100 divisions on the circular scale\n(c) an optical instrument that can measure length to within a wavelength of light ?\n\n2.7 A student measures the thickness of a human hair by looking at it through a\nmicroscope of magnification 100. He makes 20 observations and finds that the average\nwidth of the hair in the field of view of the microscope is 3.5 mm. What is the\nestimate on the thickness of hair ?\n\n2.8 Answer the following :\n(a)You are given a thread and a metre scale.  How will you estimate the diameter of\n\nthe thread ?\n(b)A screw gauge has a pitch of 1.0 mm and 200 divisions on the circular scale. Do\n\nyou think it is possible to increase the accuracy of the screw gauge arbitrarily by\nincreasing the number of divisions on the circular scale ?\n\n(c) The mean diameter of a thin brass rod is to be measured by  vernier callipers.  Why\nis a set of 100 measurements of the diameter expected to yield a more reliable\nestimate than a set of 5 measurements only ?\n\n2.9 The photograph of a house occupies an area of 1.75 cm2 on a 35 mm slide.  The slide\nis projected on to a screen, and the area of the house on the screen is 1.55 m2.  What\nis the linear magnification of the projector-screen arrangement.\n\n2.10 State the number of significant figures in the following :\n(a)  0.007 m2\n\n(b)  2.64 × 1024 kg\n(c)  0.2370 g cm–3\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS36\n\n(d)  6.320 J\n(e)  6.032 N m–2\n\n(f)   0.0006032 m2\n\n2.11 The length, breadth and thickness of a rectangular sheet of metal are 4.234 m, 1.005 m,\nand 2.01 cm respectively. Give the area and volume of the sheet to correct significant\nfigures.\n\n2.12 The mass of a box measured by a grocer’s balance is 2.30 kg. Two gold pieces of\nmasses 20.15 g  and 20.17 g are added to the box.  What is (a) the total mass of the\nbox, (b) the difference in the masses of the pieces to correct significant figures ?\n\n2.13 A physical quantity P is related to four observables a, b, c and d as follows :\n\n( )= 3 2P a b / c d\nThe percentage errors of measurement in a, b, c and d are 1%, 3%, 4% and 2%,\nrespectively. What is the percentage error in the quantity P ?  If the value of P calculated\nusing the above relation turns out to be 3.763, to what value should you round off\nthe result ?\n\n2.14 A book with many printing errors contains four different formulas for the displacement\ny of a particle undergoing a certain periodic motion :\n(a) y = a sin 2π t/T\n(b) y = a sin vt\n(c) y = (a/T) sin t/a\n\n(d) y a t T t T= ( )2  (sin 2 / +  cos 2 / )π π\n(a = maximum displacement of the particle, v = speed of the particle.  T = time-period\nof motion). Rule out the wrong formulas on dimensional grounds.\n\n2.15 A famous relation in physics relates ‘moving mass’ m to the ‘rest mass’ m\no\n of a\n\nparticle in terms of its speed v and the speed of light, c.  (This relation first arose as\na consequence of special relativity due to Albert Einstein). A boy recalls the relation\nalmost correctly but forgets where to put the constant c.  He writes :\n\n( )\nm\n\nm\n\n1 v\n\n0=\n−\n\n2 1/2 .\n\nGuess where to put the missing c.\n\n2.16 The unit of length convenient on the atomic scale is known as an angstrom and is\ndenoted by Å: 1 Å = 10–10 m. The size of a hydrogen atom is about 0.5 Å. What is the\ntotal  atomic volume in m3 of a mole of hydrogen atoms ?\n\n2.17 One mole of an ideal gas at standard temperature and pressure occupies 22.4 L\n(molar volume). What is the ratio of molar volume to the atomic volume of a mole of\nhydrogen ?   (Take the size of  hydrogen molecule to be about 1 Å). Why is this ratio\nso large ?\n\n2.18 Explain this common observation clearly : If you look out of the window of a fast\nmoving train, the nearby trees, houses etc. seem to move rapidly in a direction opposite\nto the train’s motion, but the distant objects (hill tops, the Moon, the stars etc.)\nseem to be stationary. (In fact, since you  are aware that you are moving, these\ndistant objects seem to move with you).\n\n2.19 The principle of ‘parallax’ in section 2.3.1 is used in the determination of distances\nof very distant stars. The baseline AB is the line joining the Earth’s two locations six\nmonths apart in its orbit around the Sun.  That is, the baseline is about the diameter\nof the Earth’s orbit  ≈  3 ×  1011m. However, even the nearest stars are so distant that\nwith such a long baseline, they show parallax only of the order of 1” (second) of arc\nor so. A parsec is a convenient unit of length on the astronomical scale.  It is the\ndistance of an object that will show a parallax of 1” (second of arc) from opposite\nends of a baseline equal to the distance from the Earth to the Sun. How much is a\nparsec in terms of metres ?\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nUNITS AND MEASUREMENT 37\n\n2.20 The nearest star to our solar system is 4.29 light years away. How much is this\ndistance  in terms of parsecs?  How much parallax would this star (named Alpha\nCentauri) show when viewed  from two locations of the Earth six months apart in its\norbit around the Sun ?\n\n2.21 Precise measurements of physical quantities are a need of science.  For example, to\nascertain the speed of an aircraft, one must have an accurate method to find its\npositions at closely separated instants of time. This was the actual motivation behind\nthe discovery of radar in World War II. Think of different examples in modern science\nwhere precise measurements of length, time, mass etc. are needed. Also, wherever\nyou can, give a quantitative idea of the precision needed.\n\n2.22 Just as precise measurements are necessary in science, it is equally important to be\nable to make rough estimates of quantities using rudimentary ideas and common\nobservations. Think of ways by which you can estimate the following (where an\nestimate is difficult to obtain, try to get an upper bound on the quantity) :\n(a) the total mass of rain-bearing clouds over India during the Monsoon\n(b) the mass of an elephant\n(c) the wind speed during a storm\n(d) the number  of strands of hair on  your head\n(e) the number of air molecules in your classroom.\n\n2.23 The Sun is a hot plasma (ionized matter) with its inner core at a temperature exceeding\n107 K, and its outer surface at a temperature of about 6000 K. At these high\ntemperatures, no substance remains in a solid or liquid phase. In what range do you\nexpect the mass density of the Sun to be, in the range of densities of solids and\nliquids or gases ?  Check if your guess is correct from the following data : mass of the\nSun = 2.0 × 1030 kg, radius of the Sun = 7.0 ×  108 m.\n\n2.24 When the planet Jupiter is at a distance of 824.7 million kilometers from the Earth,\nits  angular diameter is measured to be 35.72" of arc. Calculate the diameter of\nJupiter.\n\nAdditional Exercises\n\n2.25 A man walking briskly in rain with speed v must slant his umbrella forward making\nan angle θ with the vertical. A student derives the following relation between θ  and\nv :  tan θ  = v and checks that the relation has a correct limit: as v → 0, θ → 0, as\nexpected. (We are assuming there is no strong wind and that the rain falls vertically\nfor a stationary man). Do you think this relation can be correct ? If not, guess the\ncorrect relation.\n\n2.26 It is claimed that two cesium clocks, if allowed to run for 100 years, free from any\ndisturbance, may differ by only about 0.02 s. What does this imply for the accuracy\nof the standard cesium clock in measuring a time-interval of 1 s ?\n\n2.27 Estimate the average mass density of a sodium atom assuming its size to be about\n2.5 Å. (Use the known values of Avogadro’s number and the atomic mass of sodium).\nCompare it with the mass density of sodium in its crystalline phase : 970 kg m–3. Are\nthe two densities of the same order of magnitude ? If so, why ?\n\n2.28 The unit of length convenient on the nuclear scale is a fermi : 1 f = 10–15 m. Nuclear\nsizes obey roughly the following empirical relation :\n\nr = r\n0\n A1/3\n\nwhere r is the radius of the nucleus, A its mass number, and r\no\n is a constant equal to\n\nabout, 1.2 f. Show that the rule implies that nuclear mass density is nearly constant\nfor different nuclei. Estimate the mass density of sodium nucleus. Compare it with\nthe average mass density of a sodium atom obtained in Exercise. 2.27.\n\n2.29 A LASER is a source of very intense, monochromatic, and unidirectional beam of\nlight. These properties of a laser light can be exploited to measure long distances.\nThe distance of the Moon from the Earth has been already determined very precisely\nusing a laser as a source of light.  A laser light beamed at the Moon takes 2.56 s to\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS38\n\nreturn after reflection at the Moon’s surface.  How much is the radius of the lunar\norbit around the Earth ?\n\n2.30 A SONAR (sound navigation and ranging) uses ultrasonic waves to detect and locate\nobjects under water. In a submarine equipped with a  SONAR, the time delay between\ngeneration of a probe wave and the reception of its echo after reflection from an\nenemy submarine is found to be 77.0 s.  What is the distance of the enemy submarine?\n(Speed of sound in water = 1450 m s–1).\n\n2.31 The farthest objects in our Universe discovered by modern astronomers are so distant\nthat light emitted by them takes billions of years to reach the Earth.  These objects\n(known as quasars) have many puzzling features, which have not yet been satisfactorily\nexplained. What is the distance in km of a quasar from which light takes 3.0 billion\nyears to reach us ?\n\n2.32 It is a well known fact that during a total solar eclipse the disk of the moon almost\ncompletely covers the disk of the Sun.  From this fact and from the information you\ncan gather from examples 2.3 and 2.4, determine the approximate diameter of the\nmoon.\n\n2.33 A great physicist of this century (P.A.M. Dirac) loved playing with numerical values of\nFundamental constants of nature. This led him to an interesting observation.  Dirac\nfound that from the basic constants of atomic physics (c, e, mass of electron, mass of\nproton) and the gravitational constant G, he could arrive at a number with the\ndimension of time. Further, it was a very large number, its magnitude being close to\nthe present estimate on the age of the universe (~15 billion years). From the table of\nfundamental constants in this book, try to see if you too can construct this number\n(or any other interesting number you can think of ). If its coincidence with the age of\nthe universe were significant, what would this imply for the constancy of fundamental\nconstants?\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3.pmd\n\n\nCHAPTER THREE\n\nMOTION IN A STRAIGHT LINE\n\n3.1 Introduction\n\n3.2 Position, path length and\ndisplacement\n\n3.3 Average velocity and average\nspeed\n\n3.4 Instantaneous velocity and\nspeed\n\n3.5 Acceleration\n\n3.6 Kinematic equations for\nuniformly accelerated motion\n\n3.7 Relative velocity\n\nSummary\n\nPoints to ponder\n\nExercises\n\nAdditional exercises\n\nAppendix 3.1\n\n3.1  INTRODUCTION\n\nMotion is common to everything in the universe. We walk,\n\nrun and ride a bicycle.  Even when we are sleeping, air moves\n\ninto and out of our lungs and blood flows in arteries and\n\nveins.  We see leaves falling from trees and water flowing\n\ndown a dam.  Automobiles and planes carry people from one\n\nplace to the other. The earth rotates once every twenty-four\n\nhours and revolves round the sun once in a year. The sun\n\nitself is in motion in the Milky Way, which is again moving\n\nwithin its local group of galaxies.\n\nMotion is change in position of an object with time. How\n\ndoes the position change with time ? In this chapter, we shall\n\nlearn how to describe motion. For this, we develop the\n\nconcepts of velocity and acceleration. We shall confine\n\nourselves to the study of motion of objects along a straight\n\nline, also known as rectilinear motion. For the case of\n\nrectilinear motion with uniform acceleration, a set of simple\n\nequations can be obtained. Finally, to understand the relative\n\nnature of motion, we introduce the concept of relative velocity.\n\nIn our discussions, we shall treat the objects in motion as\n\npoint objects. This approximation is valid so far as the size\n\nof the object is much smaller than the distance it moves in a\n\nreasonable duration of time.  In a good number of situations\n\nin real-life, the size of objects can be neglected and they can\n\nbe considered as point-like objects without much error.\n\nIn Kinematics, we study ways to describe motion without\n\ngoing into the causes of motion. What causes motion\n\ndescribed in this chapter and the next chapter forms the\n\nsubject matter of Chapter 5.\n\n3.2  POSITION, PATH LENGTH AND DISPLACEMENT\n\nEarlier you learnt that motion is change in position of an\n\nobject with time. In order to specify position, we need to use\n\na reference point and a set of axes. It is convenient to choose\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS40\n\nwith the path of the car’s motion and origin of\nthe axis as the point from where the car started\nmoving, i.e. the car was at x = 0 at t = 0 (Fig. 3.1).\nLet P, Q and R represent the positions of the car\nat different instants of time.  Consider two cases\nof motion.  In the first case, the car moves from\nO to P.  Then the distance moved by the car is\nOP = +360 m. This distance is called the path\nlength  traversed by the car.   In the second\ncase, the car moves from O to P and then moves\nback from P to Q.   During this course of motion,\nthe path length traversed is OP + PQ = + 360 m\n+ (+120 m) = + 480 m.  Path length is a scalar\nquantity — a quantity that has a magnitude\nonly and no direction (see Chapter 4).\n\nDisplacement\n\nIt is useful to define another quantity\ndisplacement  as  the  change  in position. Let\nx\n\n1\n and x\n\n2\n be the positions of an object at time t\n\n1\n\nand t\n2\n. Then its displacement, denoted by ∆x, in\n\ntime ∆t = (t\n2 \n\n- t\n1\n), is given by the difference\n\nbetween the final and initial positions :\n                       ∆x = x\n\n2 \n– x\n\n1\n\n(We use the Greek letter delta (∆) to denote a\nchange in a quantity.)\n\nIf   x\n2\n > x\n\n1\n, ∆x is positive; and if x\n\n2 \n< x\n\n1\n,\n \n∆x is\n\nnegative.\nDisplacement has both magnitude and\n\ndirection. Such quantities are represented by\nvectors. You will read about vectors in the next\nchapter. Presently, we are dealing with motion\nalong a straight line (also called rectilinear\nmotion) only. In one-dimensional motion, there\nare only two directions (backward and forward,\nupward and downward) in which an object can\nmove, and these two directions can easily be\nspecified by + and – signs. For example,\ndisplacement of the car in moving from O to P is :\n\n∆x = x\n2\n – x\n\n1\n = (+360 m) – 0 m = +360 m\n\nThe displacement has a magnitude of 360 m and\n\nis directed in the positive x direction as indicated\nby the + sign. Similarly, the displacement of the\n\ncar from P to Q is 240 m – 360 m = – 120 m. The\n\nFig. 3.1  x-axis, origin and positions of a car at different times.\n\na rectangular coordinate system consisting of\n\nthree mutually perpenducular axes, labelled  X-,\n\nY-, and Z- axes. The point of intersection of these\n\nthree axes is called origin (O) and serves as the\n\nreference point. The coordinates (x, y. z) of an\n\nobject describe the position of the object with\n\nrespect to this coordinate system. To measure\n\ntime, we position a clock in this system. This\n\ncoordinate system along with a clock constitutes\n\na frame of reference.\n\nIf one or more coordinates of an object change\n\nwith time, we say that the object is in motion.\n\nOtherwise, the object is said to be at rest with\n\nrespect to this frame of reference.\n\nThe choice of a set of axes in a frame of\n\nreference depends upon the situation. For\n\nexample, for describing motion in one dimension,\n\nwe need only one axis. To describe motion in\n\ntwo/three dimensions, we need a set of two/\n\nthree axes.\n\nDescription of an event depends on the frame\n\nof reference chosen for the description. For\n\nexample, when you say that a car is moving on\n\na road, you are describing the car with respect\n\nto a frame of reference attached to you or to the\n\nground. But with respect to a frame of reference\nattached with a person sitting in the car, the\n\ncar is at rest.\n\nTo describe motion along a straight line, we\n\ncan choose an axis, say X-axis, so that it\n\ncoincides with the path of the object. We then\nmeasure the position of the object with reference\nto a conveniently chosen origin, say O, as shown\nin Fig. 3.1. Positions to the right of O are taken\nas positive and to the left of O, as negative.\nFollowing this convention, the position\ncoordinates of point P and Q in Fig. 3.1 are +360\nm and +240 m. Similarly, the position coordinate\nof point R is –120 m.\n\nPath length\n\nConsider the motion of a car along a straight\nline.  We choose the x-axis such that it coincides\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMOTION IN A STRAIGHT LINE 41\n\nnegative sign indicates the direction of\ndisplacement. Thus, it is not necessary to use\nvector notation for discussing motion of objects\nin one-dimension.\n\nThe magnitude of displacement may or may\nnot be equal to the path length traversed by\nan object.  For example, for motion of the car\nfrom O to P, the path length is  +360 m and the\ndisplacement is +360 m. In this case, the\nmagnitude of displacement (360 m) is equal to\nthe path length (360 m). But consider the motion\nof the car from O to P and back to Q. In this\ncase, the path length = (+360 m) + (+120 m) = +\n480 m. However, the displacement = (+240 m) –\n(0 m) =  + 240 m.  Thus, the magnitude of\ndisplacement (240 m) is not equal to the path\nlength (480 m).\n\nThe magnitude of the displacement for a\ncourse of motion may be zero but the\ncorresponding path length is not zero.  For\nexample, if the car starts from O, goes to P and\n\nthen returns to O, the final position coincides\n\nwith the initial position and the displacement\n\nis zero. However, the path length of this journey\n\nis OP + PO = 360 m +  360 m = 720 m.\n\nMotion of an object can be represented by a\n\nposition-time graph as you have already learnt\n\nabout it. Such a graph is a powerful tool to\n\nrepresent and analyse different aspects of\n\nmotion of an object.  For motion along a straight\n\nline, say X-axis, only x-coordinate varies with\n\ntime and we have an x-t graph. Let us first\n\nconsider the simple case in which an object is\n\nstationary, e.g. a car standing still at x = 40 m.\n\nThe position-time graph is a straight line parallel\n\nto the time axis, as shown in Fig. 3.2(a).\n\nIf an object moving along the straight line\n\ncovers equal distances in equal intervals of\n\ntime, it is said to be in uniform motion along a\n\nstraight line. Fig. 3.2(b) shows the position-time\n\ngraph of such a motion.\n\nFig. 3.2  Position-time graph of (a) stationary object, and (b) an object in uniform motion.\n\nFig. 3.3  Position-time graph of a car.\nt (s) \uf09e\n\n\uf023\nx\n\n(m)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS42\n\nNow, let us consider the motion of a car that\nstarts from rest at time t = 0 s from the origin O\nand picks up speed till t = 10 s and thereafter\nmoves with uniform speed till t = 18 s. Then the\nbrakes are applied and the car stops at\nt = 20 s and x = 296 m. The position-time graph\nfor this case is shown in Fig. 3.3. We shall refer\nto this graph in our discussion in the following\nsections.\n\n3.3  AVERAGE VELOCITY AND AVERAGE\nSPEED\n\nWhen an object is in motion, its position\nchanges with time.  But how fast is the position\nchanging with time and in what direction?  To\ndescribe this, we define the quantity average\nvelocity. Average velocity is defined as the\nchange in position or displacement (∆x) divided\nby the time intervals (∆t), in which the\ndisplacement occurs :\n\n     v\nx x\n\nt t\n\nx\n\nt\n\n2 1\n\n2 1\n\n=\n−\n\n−\n=\n\n∆\n\n∆\n(3.1)\n\nwhere x\n2\n  and x\n\n1\n are the positions of the object\n\nat time t\n2\nand  t\n\n1\n, respectively. Here the bar over\n\nthe symbol for velocity is a standard notation\nused to indicate an average quantity.  The SI\nunit for velocity is m/s or m s–1, although km h–1\n\nis used in many everyday applications.\nLike displacement, average velocity is also a\n\nvector quantity. But as explained earlier, for\nmotion in a straight line, the directional aspect\nof the vector can be taken care of by + and –\nsigns and we do not have to use the vector\nnotation for velocity in this chapter.\n\nFig. 3.4 The average velocity is the slope of line P\n1\nP\n\n2\n.\n\nConsider the motion of the car in Fig. 3.3. The\nportion of the x-t graph between t = 0 s and t = 8\ns is blown up and shown in Fig. 3.4.  As seen\nfrom the plot, the average velocity of the car\nbetween time t = 5 s and t = 7 s is :\n\n(((( ))))\n(((( ))))\n\n1–\n\n12\n\n12\nsm  8.7\n\ns 57\n\nm 010427\n====\n\n−−−−\n\n−−−−\n====\n\n−−−−\n\n−−−−\n====\n\n..\n\ntt\n\nxx\nv\n\nGeometrically, this is the slope of the straight\nline P\n\n1\nP\n\n2\n connecting the initial position \n\n1\nP  to\n\nthe final position P\n2\n   \nas\n\n   \nshown in Fig. 3.4.\n\nThe average velocity can be positive or negative\ndepending upon the sign of the displacement. It\nis zero if the displacement is zero. Fig. 3.5 shows\nthe x-t graphs for an object, moving with positive\nvelocity (Fig. 3.5a), moving with negative velocity\n(Fig. 3.5b)  and at rest (Fig. 3.5c).\n\nAverage velocity as defined above involves\nonly the displacement of the object. We have seen\nearlier that the magnitude of displacement may\nbe different from the actual path length. To\ndescribe the rate of motion over the actual path,\nwe introduce another quantity called average\nspeed.\n\nAverage speed  is defined as the total path\nlength travelled divided by the total time\ninterval during which the motion has taken\nplace :\n\nAverage speed\nTotal path length\n\nTotal time interval \n=   (3.2)\n\nAverage speed has obviously the same unit\n(m s–1) as that of velocity.  But it does not tell us\nin what direction an object is moving.  Thus, it\nis always positive (in contrast to the average\nvelocity which can be positive or negative). If the\nmotion of an object is along a straight line and\nin the same direction, the magnitude of\ndisplacement is equal to the total path length.\nIn that case, the magnitude of average velocity\n\nFig. 3.5 Position-time graph for an object (a) moving\nwith positive velocity, (b) moving with\n\nnegative velocity, and (c) at rest.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMOTION IN A STRAIGHT LINE 43\n\n\uf074\n\nis equal to the average speed.  This is not always\nthe case, as you will see in the following example.\n\nExample 3.1 A car is moving along a\nstraight line, say OP in Fig. 3.1.  It moves\nfrom O to P in 18 s and returns from P to Q\nin 6.0 s.  What are the average velocity\nand average speed of the car in going (a)\nfrom O to P ? and (b) from O to P and back\nto Q ?\n\nAnswer    (a)\n\n Average velocity\nDisplacement\n\nTime interval \n=\n\n   1\n+ 360 m \n\n20 m s\n18 s\n\nv\n−= = +\n\n     Average speed  \nPath length\n\nTime interval\n=\n\n                \n1360 m \n\n= 20 m s\n18 s\n\n−=\n\nThus, in this case the average speed is equal to\nthe magnitude of the average velocity.\n(b) In this case,\n\n( )\n240 m\n\n18 6.0  s\n\nDisplacement \nAverage velocity =\n\nTime interval \n\n+\n=\n\n+\n\n                            -1=+10 ms\n\nOP + PQPath length\nAverage speed = =\n\nTime interval t∆\n\n \n( ) -1360+120  m\n\n= = 20 m s\n24 s\n\nThus, in this case the average speed is not equal\nto the magnitude of the average velocity. This\nhappens because the motion here involves\nchange in direction so that the path length is\ngreater than the magnitude of displacement.\nThis shows that speed is, in general, greater\nthan the magnitude of the velocity. \uf074\n\nIf the car in Example 3.1 moves from O to P\n\nand comes back to O in the same time interval,\naverage speed is 20 m/s but the average velocity\nis zero !\n\n3.4  INSTANTANEOUS VELOCITY AND SPEED\n\nThe average velocity tells us how fast an object\nhas been moving over a given time interval but\ndoes not tell us how fast it moves at different\ninstants of time during that interval.  For this,\nwe define instantaneous velocity or simply\nvelocity v at an instant t.\n\nThe velocity at an instant is defined as the\nlimit of the average velocity as the time interval\n∆t becomes infinitesimally small. In other words,\n\nv lim\nx\n\nt\n=\n\nt  0∆ \n\n∆\n\n∆→\n(3.3a)\n\n  =\nd\n\nd\n\nx\n\nt\n\n(3.3b)\n\nwhere the symbol \nlim\n\nt 0∆ →\n stands for the operation\n\nof taking limit as  ∆t\uf0670 of the quantity on its\nright. In the language of calculus, the quantity\non the right hand side of Eq. (3.3a) is the\ndifferential coefficient of x with respect to t and\n\nis denoted by \n \n\nd\n\nd\n\nx\n\nt\n (see Appendix 3.1).  It is the\n\nrate of change of position with respect to time,\n\nat that instant.\n\nWe can use Eq. (3.3a) for obtaining the value\nof velocity at an instant either graphically or\nnumerically. Suppose that we want to obtain\ngraphically the value of velocity at time  t = 4 s\n(point P) for the motion of the car represented\nin Fig. 3.3. The figure has been redrawn in\nFig. 3.6 choosing different scales to facilitate the\n\nFig. 3.6 Determining velocity from position-time\ngraph.  Velocity at t = 4 s is the slope of the\ntangent to the graph at that instant.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS44\n\ncalculation. Let us take ∆t = 2 s centred at\nt = 4 s. Then, by the definition of the average\nvelocity, the slope of line P1P2  ( Fig. 3.6) gives\nthe value of average velocity over the interval\n3 s to 5 s.  Now, we decrease the value of ∆t from\n2 s to 1 s.  Then line P1P2 becomes Q1Q2   and its\nslope gives the value of the average velocity over\nthe interval 3.5 s to 4.5 s. In the limit ∆t → 0,\nthe line P\n\n1\nP\n\n2\n becomes tangent to the position-\n\ntime curve at the point P and the velocity at t =\n4 s is given by the slope of the tangent at that\npoint. It is difficult to show this process\ngraphically. But if we use numerical method\nto obtain the value of the velocity, the\nmeaning of the limiting process becomes\nclear. For the graph shown in\nFig. 3.6, x = 0.08 t3.  Table 3.1 gives the value of\n∆x/∆t calculated for ∆t equal to 2.0 s, 1.0 s, 0.5\ns, 0.1 s and 0.01 s centred at t = 4.0 s. The\nsecond and third columns give the value of t\n\n1\n=\n\nt\nt\n\n2\n−\n\n\uf001\n\n\uf002\n\uf003\n\n\uf004\n\n\uf005\n\uf006\n\n∆\n and t t\n\nt\n\n2\n2 = +\n\n\uf001\n\n\uf002\n\uf003\n\n\uf004\n\n\uf005\n\uf006\n\n∆\n and the fourth and\n\nthe fifth columns give the corresponding values\n\nof x, i.e. x (t\n1\n) = 0.08 t\n\n1\n\n3\n and x (t\n\n2\n) = 0.08 t\n\n2\n\n3. The\nsixth column lists the difference ∆x = x (t\n\n2\n) – x\n\n(t\n1\n) and the last column gives the ratio of ∆x and\n\n∆t, i.e. the average velocity corresponding to the\nvalue of ∆t listed in the first column.\n\nWe see from Table 3.1 that as we decrease\nthe value of ∆t from 2.0 s to 0.010 s, the value of\nthe average velocity approaches the limiting\nvalue 3.84 m s–1 which is the value of velocity at\n\nt = 4.0 s, i.e. the value of  \nd\n\nd\n\nx\n\nt\n at t = 4.0 s. In this\n\nmanner, we can calculate velocity at each\n\ninstant for motion of the car shown in Fig. 3.3.\nFor this case, the variation of velocity with time\nis found to be as shown in Fig. 3.7.\n\nFig. 3.7 Velocity–time graph corresponding to motion\nshown in Fig. 3.3.\n\nThe graphical method for the determination\nof the instantaneous velocity is always not a\nconvenient method.  For this, we must carefully\nplot the position–time graph and calculate the\nvalue of average velocity as ∆t becomes smaller\nand smaller.  It is easier to calculate the value\nof velocity at different instants if we have data\nof positions at different instants or exact\nexpression for the position as a function of time.\nThen, we calculate ∆x/∆t from the data for\ndecreasing the value of ∆t and find the limiting\nvalue as we have done in Table 3.1 or use\ndifferential calculus for the given expression and\n\ncalculate \nd\n\nd\n\nx\n\nt\n at different instants as done in\n\nthe following example.\n\nTable 3.1  Limiting value of \n∆\n\n∆\n\nx\n\nt\n at t = 4 s\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMOTION IN A STRAIGHT LINE 45\n\n\uf074\n\nExample 3.2    The position of an object\nmoving along x-axis is given by   x = a + bt2\n\nwhere  a = 8.5 m, b = 2.5 m s–2 and t is\nmeasured in seconds. What is its velocity at\n\nt = 0 s and t = 2.0 s. What is the average\nvelocity between t = 2.0 s and t = 4.0 s ?\n\nAnswer  In notation of differential calculus, the\nvelocity is\n\n( )v x\nt t\n\na bt 2b t =  \n2\n\n= = + =\nd\n\nd\n\nd\n\nd\n5.0 t m s\n\n-1\n \n\nAt   t = 0 s,      v = 0 m s–1   and at   t = 2.0 s,\nv = 10 m s-1 .\n\n( ) ( )4.0 2.0\n4.0 2.0\n\nx x\nAverage velocity\n\n−\n=\n\n−\n\n        \n16 – – 4\n\n6.0\n2.0\n\na b a b\nb\n\n+\n= = ×\n\n        -16.0 2.5 =15 m s= ×           \uf020\uf020\uf074\nFrom Fig. 3.7, we note that during the period\n\nt =10 s to 18 s the velocity is constant. Between\nperiod t =18 s to t = 20 s, it is uniformly\ndecreasing  and  during  the  period t = 0 s to     t\n= 10 s, it is increasing. Note that for uniform\nmotion, velocity is the same as the average\nvelocity at all instants.\n\nInstantaneous speed or simply speed is the\nmagnitude of velocity. For example, a velocity of\n+ 24.0 m s–1 and a velocity of – 24.0 m s–1 — both\nhave an associated speed of 24.0 m s-1.  It should\nbe noted that though average speed over a finite\ninterval of time is greater or equal to the\nmagnitude of the average velocity,\ninstantaneous speed at an instant is equal to\nthe magnitude of the instantaneous velocity at\nthat instant. Why so ?\n\n3.5  ACCELERATION\n\nThe velocity of an object, in general, changes\nduring its course of motion. How to describe this\nchange? Should it be described as the rate of\nchange in velocity with distance or with time ?\nThis was a problem even in Galileo’s time. It was\nfirst thought that this change could be described\nby the rate of change of velocity with distance.\nBut, through his studies of motion of freely falling\nobjects and motion of objects on an inclined\nplane, Galileo concluded that the rate of change\nof velocity with time is a constant of motion for\nall objects in free fall. On the other hand, the\nchange in velocity with distance is not constant\n– it decreases with the increasing distance of fall.\n\nThis led to the concept of acceleration as the rate\nof change of velocity with time.\n\n The average acceleration a  over a time\n\ninterval is defined as the change of velocity\ndivided by the time interval :\n\n2 1\n\n2 1\n\n–\n\n–\n\nv v v\na\n\nt t t\n\n∆\n= =\n\n∆ (3.4)\n\nwhere v2 and v1 are the instantaneous velocities\nor simply velocities at time  t2\n\n \nand t1\n\n \n. It is the\n\naverage change of velocity per unit time. The SI\nunit of acceleration is m s–2 .\n\nOn a plot of velocity versus time, the average\nacceleration is the slope of the straight line\nconnecting the points corresponding to (v2, t2)\nand (v1, t1). The average acceleration\nfor     velocity-time graph shown in Fig. 3.7 for\ndifferent time intervals 0 s - 10 s, 10 s – 18 s,\nand 18 s – 20 s are :\n\n0 s - 10 s\n( )\n\n( )\n\n–1\n–224 – 0 m s\n\n2.4 m s\n10 – 0 s\n\na = =\n\n10 s - 18 s   \n( )\n\n( )\n\n–1\n–224 – 24 m s\n\n0 m s\n18 – 10 s\n\na = =\n\n18 s - 20 s    \n( )\n\n( )\n\n–1\n–20 – 24 m s\n\n– 12 m s\n20 – 18 s\n\na = =\n\nFig. 3.8 Acceleration as a function of time for motion\n\nrepresented in Fig. 3.3.\n\nInstantaneous acceleration is defined in the same\nway as the instantaneous velocity :\n\nd\n\ndt 0\n\nv v\na lim\n\nt t∆ →\n\n∆\n= =\n\n∆\n(3.5)\n\nThe acceleration at an instant is the slope of\nthe tangent to the v–t curve at that instant.  For\nthe v–t curve shown in  Fig.  3.7, we can obtain\nacceleration at every instant of time. The\nresulting a – t curve is shown in Fig. 3.8. We see\n\n a\n (\nm\n\n s\n–\n2\n)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS46\n\nthat the acceleration is nonuniform over the\nperiod  0 s to 10 s. It is zero between 10 s and\n18 s and is constant with value –12 m s–2\n\nbetween 18 s and 20 s. When the acceleration\nis uniform, obviously, it equals the average\nacceleration over that period.\n\nSince velocity is a quantity having both\nmagnitude and direction, a change in velocity\nmay involve either or both of these factors.\nAcceleration, therefore, may result from a\nchange in speed (magnitude), a change in\ndirection or changes in both.  Like velocity,\nacceleration can also be positive, negative or\nzero.  Position-time graphs for motion with\npositive, negative and zero acceleration are\nshown in Figs. 3.9 (a), (b) and (c), respectively.\nNote that the graph curves upward for positive\nacceleration; downward for negative\nacceleration and it is a straight line for zero\nacceleration. As an exercise, identify in Fig. 3.3,\nthe regions of the curve that correspond to these\nthree cases.\n\nAlthough acceleration can vary with time,\nour study in this chapter will be restricted to\nmotion with constant acceleration. In this case,\nthe average acceleration equals the constant\nvalue of acceleration during the interval. If the\nvelocity of an object is v\n\no\n at t = 0 and v at time t,\n\nwe have\n\n          or\n0\n\n0\n0\n\nv v\na   ,  v v a t\n\nt\n\n−\n= = +\n\n−\n(3.6)\n\nFig. 3.9 Position-time graph for motion with\n(a) positive acceleration; (b) negative\n\nacceleration, and (c) zero acceleration.\n\nLet us see how velocity-time graph looks like\nfor some simple cases. Fig. 3.10 shows     velocity-\ntime graph for motion with constant acceleration\nfor the following cases :\n\n(a) An object is moving in a positive direction\nwith a positive acceleration, for example\nthe motion of the car in  Fig. 3.3 between\nt = 0 s and t = 10 s.\n\n(b) An object is moving in positive direction\nwith a negative acceleration, for example,\nmotion of the car in Fig 3.3 between\nt = 18 s and 20 s.\n\n(c) An object is moving in negative direction\nwith a negative acceleration, for example\nthe motion of a car moving from O in Fig.\n3.1 in negative x-direction with\nincreasing speed.\n\n(d) An object is moving in positive direction\ntill time t1, and then turns back with the\nsame negative acceleration, for example\nthe motion of a car from point O to point\nQ in Fig. 3.1 till time t1 with decreasing\nspeed and turning back and moving with\nthe same negative acceleration.\n\nAn interesting feature of a velocity-time graph\nfor any moving object is that the area under the\ncurve represents the displacement over a\ngiven time interval. A general proof of this\n\nFig. 3.10 Velocity–time graph for motions with\n\nconstant acceleration. (a) Motion in positive\n\ndirection with positive acceleration,\n\n(b) Motion in positive direction with\n\nnegative acceleration, (c) Motion in negative\n\ndirection with negative acceleration,\n\n(d) Motion of an object with negative\n\nacceleration that changes direction at time\n\nt\n1\n.  Between times 0 to t\n\n1\n, its moves in\n\npositive x - direction and between t\n1\n and\n\nt\n2\n it moves in the opposite direction.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMOTION IN A STRAIGHT LINE 47\n\nstatement requires use of calculus. We can,\nhowever, see that it is true for the simple case of\nan object moving with constant velocity u. Its\nvelocity-time graph is as shown in Fig. 3.11.\n\nFig. 3.11 Area under v–t curve equals displacement\n\nof the object over a given time interval.\n\nThe v-t curve is\n \na straight line parallel to the\n\ntime axis and the area under it between t = 0\nand t = T\n\n  \nis the area of the rectangle of height u\n\nand base T. Therefore, area = u × T = uT which\nis the displacement in this time interval.  How\ncome in this case an area is equal to a distance?\nThink!  Note the dimensions of quantities on\nthe two coordinate axes, and you will arrive at\nthe answer.\n\nNote that the x-t, v-t, and a-t graphs shown\nin several figures in this chapter have sharp\nkinks at some points implying that the\nfunctions are not differentiable at these\npoints. In any realistic situation, the\nfunctions will be differentiable at all points\nand the graphs will be smooth.\n\nWhat this means physically is that\nacceleration and velocity cannot change\nvalues abruptly at an instant. Changes are\nalways continuous.\n\n3.6 KINEMATIC EQUATIONS FOR\nUNIFORMLY ACCELERATED MOTION\n\nFor uniformly accelerated motion, we can derive\nsome simple equations that relate displacement\n(x), time taken (t), initial velocity (v\n\n0\n), final\n\nvelocity (v) and acceleration (a). Equation (3.6)\nalready obtained gives a relation between final\nand initial velocities v and  v\n\n0  \nof an object moving\n\nwith uniform acceleration\n \na :\n\n             v = v\n0\n + at (3.6)\n\nThis relation is graphically represented in Fig. 3.12.\nThe area under this curve is :\nArea between instants 0 and t = Area of triangle\nABC + Area of rectangle OACD\n\n \n( )– 0 0\n\n1\nv v t + v t\n\n2\n=\n\nFig. 3.12 Area  under v-t curve for an object with\nuniform acceleration.\n\nAs explained in the previous section, the area\nunder v-t curve represents the displacement.\nTherefore, the displacement x of the object is :\n\n( )\n1\n\n–\n2\n\n0 0x v v t + v t= (3.7)\n\nBut v v a t\n0\n\n− =\n\nTherefore,\n2\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\nx a t + v t=\n\nor,\n2\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\nx v t at= + (3.8)\n\nEquation (3.7) can also be written as\n\n0\n\n2\n\nv + v\nx t v t= = (3.9a)\n\nwhere,\n\n0\n\n2\n\nv v\nv\n\n+\n=   (constant acceleration only)\n\n(3.9b)\n\nEquations (3.9a) and  (3.9b) mean that the object\nhas undergone displacement x with an average\nvelocity equal to the arithmetic average of the\ninitial and final velocities.\nFrom Eq. (3.6), t = (v – v\n\n0\n)/a. Substituting this in\n\nEq. (3.9a), we get\n\n       x v t\nv v v v\n\na\n\nv v\n\na\n= =\n\n+\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n−\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n=\n−0 0\n\n2\n0\n2\n\n2 2\n\n     2 2\n0 2v v ax= + (3.10)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS48\n\n\uf074\n\nThis equation can also be obtained by\nsubstituting the value of t from Eq. (3.6) into\nEq. (3.8). Thus, we have obtained three\nimportant equations :\n\n0v v at= +\n\n         \n2\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\nx v t at= +\n\n2 2\n0 2v v ax= + (3.11a)\n\nconnecting five quantities v\n0\n,  v, a, t and x.  These\n\nare kinematic equations of rectilinear motion\nfor constant acceleration.\n\nThe set of Eq. (3.11a) were obtained by\nassuming that at t = 0, the position of the\nparticle, x is 0.

The\nheight of the point from where the ball is\nthrown is 25.0 m from the ground. (a) How\nhigh will the ball rise ?  and (b) how long\nwill it be before the ball hits the ground?\nTake g = 10 m s–2.\n\nAnswer  (a) Let us take the y-axis in the\n\nvertically upward direction with zero at the\n\nground, as shown in Fig. 3.13.\n\nNow  v\no\n \n= + 20 m s–1,\n\n   a  =  – g = –10 m s–2,\n\n   v  =  0 m s–1\n\nIf the ball rises to height y from the point of\n\nlaunch, then using the equation\n\n( )0   2 20v v 2 a y – y= +\nwe get\n\n0 = (20)2 + 2(–10)(y – y\n0\n)\n\nSolving,  we get, (y – y\n0\n) = 20 m.\n\n(b) We can solve this part of the problem in two\n\nways.  Note carefully the methods used.\n\n\uf074\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMOTION IN A STRAIGHT LINE 49\n\n\uf074\n\nFig. 3.13\n\nFIRST METHOD :  In the first method, we split\nthe path in two parts : the upward motion  (A to\nB) and the downward motion (B to C) and\ncalculate the corresponding time taken t\n\n1\n and\n\nt\n2\n.  Since the velocity  at B is zero, we have :\n                  v  =  v\n\no\n +  at\n\n0 = 20  – 10t\n1\n\nOr,            t\n1 \n= 2 s\n\nThis is the time in going from A to B.  From B, or\nthe point of  the maximum height, the ball falls\nfreely under the acceleration due to gravity.  The\nball is moving in negative y direction.  We use\nequation\n\n          \n2\n\n0 0\n\n1\n\n2\ny y v t at= + +\n\nWe have, y\n0\n = 45 m, y = 0, v\n\n0\n = 0, a = – g  = –10 m s–2\n\n   0  =  45 + (½) (–10) t\n2\n\n2\n\nSolving, we get t\n2\n = 3 s\n\nTherefore, the total time taken by the ball before\nit hits the ground = t\n\n1 \n+\n\n   \nt\n2\n  = \n\n \n2\n\n  \ns\n\n \n+ 3 s = 5 s.\n\nSECOND METHOD : The total time taken can\nalso be calculated by noting the coordinates of\ninitial and final positions of the ball with respect\nto the origin chosen and using equation\n\n2\n0 0\n\n1\n\n2\ny y v t at= + +\n\nNow y\n0  \n\n=\n  \n25 m        y = 0 m\n\nv\no\n = 20 m s-1, a  = –10m s–2,  t  =  ?\n\n0 = 25  +20 t  + (½)  (-10) t2\n\nOr, 5t2 – 20t  – 25  =  0\n\nSolving this quadratic equation for t, we get\n\nt = 5s\n\nNote that the second method is better since we\ndo not have to worry about the path of the motion\nas the motion is under constant acceleration.\n\n\uf020\uf020\uf074\n\nExample 3.5  Free-fall : Discuss the\nmotion of an object under free  fall.  Neglect\nair resistance.\n\nAnswer  An object released near the surface of\nthe Earth is accelerated downward under the\ninfluence of the force of gravity. The magnitude\nof acceleration due to gravity is represented by\ng.  If air resistance is neglected, the object is\nsaid to be in free fall. If the height through\nwhich the object falls is small compared to the\nearth’s radius, g can be taken to be constant,\nequal to   9.8 m s–2. Free fall is thus a case of\nmotion with uniform acceleration.\n\nWe assume that the motion is in y-direction,\nmore correctly in –y-direction because we\nchoose upward direction as positive. Since the\nacceleration due to gravity is always downward,\nit is in the negative direction and we have\n\na = – g  = – 9.8 m s–2\n\nThe object is released from rest at y = 0. Therefore,\nv\n\n0\n = 0 and the equations of motion become:\n\nv =  0 – g t       = –9.8 t      m s–1\n\ny =  0 – ½  g t2   = –4.9 t 2    m\nv2 = 0 – 2 g y     = –19.6 y   m2 s–2\n\nThese equations give the velocity and the\ndistance travelled as a function of time and also\nthe variation of velocity with distance. The\nvariation of acceleration, velocity, and distance,\nwith time have been plotted in Fig.  3.14(a), (b)\nand (c).\n\n(a)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS50\n\n\uf074\n\n(b)\n\n      (c)\n\nFig. 3.14 Motion of an object under free fall.\n(a)  Variation of acceleration with time.\n(b) Variation of velocity with time.\n\n(c) Variation of distance with time \uf074\n\nExample 3.6 Galileo’s law of odd\nnumbers : “The distances traversed, during\nequal intervals    of time, by a body falling\n\nfrom rest, stand to one another in the same\n\nratio as the odd numbers beginning with\n\nunity [namely, 1: 3: 5: 7…...].”  Prove it.\n\nAnswer  Let us divide the time interval of\nmotion of an object under free fall into many\nequal intervals\n\n \nτ   and find out the distances\n\ntraversed during successive intervals of\ntime. Since initial velocity is zero, we have\n\nUsing this equation, we can calculate the\n\nposition of the object after different time\n\nintervals, 0, τ, 2τ,  3τ… which are given in\nsecond column of Table 3.2. If we take\n\n(–1/\n \n2) gτ2 as y\n\n0 \n— the position coordinate after\n\nfirst time interval τ, then third column gives\nthe positions in the unit of y\n\no\n. The fourth\n\ncolumn gives the distances traversed in\n\nsuccessive τs. We find that the distances are\nin the simple ratio 1: 3: 5: 7: 9: 11… as  shown\n\nin the last column. This  law was established\n\nby Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) who was the first\n\nto make quantitative studies of free fall. \uf074\n\nExample 3.7  Stopping distance of\nvehicles : When brakes are applied to a\nmoving vehicle, the distance it travels before\nstopping is called stopping distance.  It is\nan important factor for road safety and\ndepends on the initial velocity (v\n\n0\n) and the\n\nbraking capacity, or deceleration, –a that\nis caused by the braking. Derive an\nexpression for stopping distance of a vehicle\nin terms of v\n\no\n and\n\n \na.\n\nAnswer  Let the distance travelled by the vehicle\nbefore it stops be d\n\ns\n. Then, using equation of\n\nmotion  v2 = v\no\n2 + 2 ax, and noting that  v = 0, we\n\nhave the stopping distance\n\nd\nv\n\na\ns =\n\n– 0\n2\n\n2\n\nThus, the stopping distance is proportional to\nthe square of the initial velocity.

Reaction time is the\ntime a person takes to observe, think\nand act.  For example, if a person is\ndriving and suddenly a boy appears on\nthe road, then the time elapsed before\nhe slams the brakes of the car is the\nreaction time. Reaction time depends\non complexity of the situation and on\nan individual.\n\nYou can measure your reaction time\nby a simple experiment. Take a ruler\nand ask your friend to drop it vertically\nthrough the gap between your thumb\nand forefinger (Fig. 3.15). After you\ncatch it, find the distance d travelled\nby the ruler. In a particular case, d was\nfound to be 21.0 cm. Estimate reaction\ntime.\n\nOr,\n\nGiven d = 21.0 cm and g = 9.8 m s–2  the reaction\ntime is\n\n\uf074\n\n3.7  RELATIVE VELOCITY\n\nYou must be familiar with the experience of\ntravelling in a train and being overtaken by\nanother train moving in the same direction as\nyou are. While that train must be travelling faster\nthan you to be able to pass you, it does seem\nslower to you than it would be to someone\nstanding on the ground and watching both the\ntrains. In case both the trains have the same\nvelocity with respect to the ground, then to you\nthe other train would seem to be not moving at\nall.  To understand such observations, we now\nintroduce the concept of relative velocity.\n\nConsider two objects A and B moving\nuniformly with average velocities v\n\nA\n and v\n\nB\n in\n\none dimension, say along x-axis. (Unless\notherwise specified, the velocities mentioned in\nthis chapter are measured with reference to the\nground). If x\n\nA\n (0) and x\n\nB\n (0) are positions of objects\n\nA and B, respectively at time t = 0, their positions\nx\n\nA\n (t) and x\n\nB\n (t) at time t are given by:\n\nx\nA\n (t )  =  x\n\nA\n (0)  +  v\n\nA\n  t     (3.12a)\n\nx\nB\n (t)   =  x\n\nB\n (0)  +  v\n\nB\n t               (3.12b)\n\nThen, the displacement from object A to object\nB is given by\n\nx\nBA\n\n(t)  =  x\nB\n (t)  –  x\n\nA\n (t)\n\n= [ x\nB\n (0) – x\n\nA\n (0) ] + (v\n\nB\n – v\n\nA\n) t.      (3.13)\n\nEquation (3.13) is easily interpreted. It tells us\nthat as seen from object A, object B has a\nvelocity v\n\nB \n– v\n\nA\n because the displacement from\n\nA to B changes steadily by the amount v\nB \n– v\n\nA\n in\n\neach unit of time. We say that the velocity of\nobject B relative to object A is v\n\nB\n – v\n\nA\n :\n\nv\nBA\n\n  =  v\nB \n – v\n\nA\n(3.14a)\n\nSimilarly, velocity of object A relative to object B\nis:\n\nv\nAB\n\n  =  v\nA\n – v\n\nB\n(3.14b)\n\nFig. 3.15   Measuring the reaction time.\n\nAnswer  The ruler drops under free fall.\nTherefore, v\n\no\n = 0, and a = – g = –9.8 m s–2. The\n\ndistance travelled d and the reaction time t\nr\n are\n\nrelated by\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS52\n\nThis shows: v\nBA \n\n= – v\nAB\n\n(3.14c)\n\nNow we consider some special cases :\n\n(a) If v\nB\n = v\n\nA\n, v\n\nB \n–\n\n \nv\n\nA\n  = 0.  Then, from Eq. (3.13), x\n\nB\n\n(t) – x\nA\n (t) = x\n\nB\n (0) – x\n\nA\n (0).  Therefore, the two\n\nobjects stay at a constant distance (x\nB\n (0) – x\n\nA\n\n(0)) apart, and their position–time graphs are\n\nstraight lines parallel to each other as shown\n\nin Fig. 3.16. The relative velocity v\nAB\n\n or v\nBA\n\n is\n\nzero in this case.\n\n(b) If v\nA\n > v\n\nB\n, v\n\nB\n – v\n\nA\n is negative.  One graph is\n\nsteeper than the other and they meet at a\n\ncommon point.  For example, suppose v\nA \n = 20 m s-1\n\nand x\nA\n (0) = 10 m; and v\n\nB\n = 10 m s-1, x\n\nB\n (0) = 40\n\nm; then the time at which they meet is t = 3 s\n\n(Fig. 3.17). At this instant they are both at a\n\nposition x\nA\n (t) = x\n\nB\n (t) = 70 m. Thus, object A\n\novertakes object B at this time. In this case,v\nBA\n\n= 10 m s–1 – 20 m s–1 = – 10 m s–1=– v\nAB\n\n.\n\n(c) Suppose v\nA\n and v\n\nB\n are of opposite signs. For\n\nexample, if in the above example object A is\n\nmoving with 20 m s–1 starting at  x\nA\n(0) = 10 m\n\nand object B is moving with – 10 m s–1 starting\n\nat x\nB\n (0) = 40 m,  the two objects meet at t = 1 s\n\n(Fig. 3.18).  The velocity of B relative to A,\n\nv\nBA\n\n = [–10 – (20)] m s–1 = –30 m s–1 = – v\nAB\n\n. In this\n\ncase, the magnitude of v\nBA\n\n or v\nAB\n\n ( = 30 m s–1) is\n\ngreater than the magnitude of velocity of A or\n\nthat of B.  If the objects under consideration are\n\ntwo trains, then for a person sitting on either of\n\nthe two, the other train seems to go very fast.\n\nNote that Eq. (3.14) are valid even if v\nA\n and v\n\nB\n\nrepresent instantaneous velocities.\n\nExample 3.9  Two parallel rail tracks run\nnorth-south.

The position of the\nobject can be specified with reference to a conveniently chosen origin.  For motion in\na straight line, position to the right of the origin is taken as positive and to the left as\nnegative.\n\n2. Path length is defined as the total length of the path traversed by an object.\n3. Displacement is the change in position :  ∆x  =  x\n\n2 \n– x\n\n1\n.\n   \nPath length is greater or equal to\n\nthe magnitude of the displacement between the same points.\n4. An object is said to be in uniform motion in a straight line if its displacement is  equal\n\nin equal intervals of time.  Otherwise, the motion is said to be non-uniform.\n5. Average velocity is the displacement divided by the time interval in which the\n\ndisplacement occurs :\n\nv\nx\n\nt\n=\n\n∆\n\n∆\n\nOn an x-t graph, the average velocity over a time interval is the slope of the line\n\nconnecting the initial and final positions corresponding to that interval.\n\n6. Average Speed is the ratio of total path length traversed and the corresponding time\ninterval.\n\nThe average speed of an object is greater or equal to the magnitude of the average\nvelocity over a given time interval.\n\n7. Instantaneous velocity or simply velocity is defined as the limit of the average velocity as\nthe time interval ∆t becomes infinitesimally small :\n\nd\n\ndt 0 t 0\n\nx x\nv lim v lim\n\nt t∆ → ∆ →\n\n∆\n= = =\n\n∆\n\nThe velocity at a particular instant is equal to the slope of the tangent drawn on\nposition-time graph at that instant.\n\n8. Average acceleration is the change in velocity divided by the time interval during which\nthe change occurs :\n\nv\na\n\nt\n\n∆\n=\n\n∆\n\n9. Instantaneous acceleration is defined as the limit of the average acceleration as the time\ninterval ∆t goes to zero :\n\nd\n\ndt 0 t 0\n\nv v\na lim a lim\n\nt t∆ → ∆ →\n\n∆\n= = =\n\n∆\n\nThe acceleration of an object at a particular time is the slope of the velocity-time\ngraph at that instant of time.  For uniform motion, acceleration is zero and the x-t\ngraph is a straight line inclined to the time axis and the v-t graph is a straight line\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS54\n\nparallel to the time axis. For motion with uniform acceleration, x-t graph is a parabola\nwhile the v-t graph is a straight line inclined to the time axis.\n\n10. The area under the velocity-time curve between times t\n1 \nand t\n\n2\n is equal to the displacement\n\nof the object during that interval of time.\n\n11. For objects in uniformly accelerated rectilinear motion, the five quantities, displacement\nx, time taken t, initial velocity v\n\n0\n, final velocity v and acceleration a are related by a set\n\nof simple equations called kinematic equations of motion :\n\n        v = v\n0\n +  at\n\n       x v t\n1\n\n2\nat\n\n0\n\n2\n= +\n\n        v v 2ax\n2\n\n0\n\n2\n= +\n\nif the position of the object at time t = 0 is 0.  If the particle starts at x = x\n0\n , x in above\n\nequations is replaced by (x – x\n0\n).\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMOTION IN A STRAIGHT LINE 55\n\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n\n1. The path length traversed by an object between two points is, in general, not the same\nas the magnitude of displacement.  The displacement depends only on the end points;\nthe path length (as the name implies) depends on the actual path.  In one dimension,\nthe two quantities are equal only if the object does not change its direction during the\ncourse of motion.  In all other cases, the path length is greater than the magnitude of\ndisplacement.\n\n2. In view of point 1 above, the average speed of an object is greater than or equal to the\nmagnitude of the average velocity over a given time interval. The two are equal only if\nthe path length is equal to the magnitude of displacement.\n\n3. The origin and the positive direction of an axis are a matter of choice. You should first\nspecify this choice before you assign signs to quantities like displacement, velocity\nand acceleration.\n\n4. If a particle is speeding up, acceleration is in the direction of velocity; if its speed is\ndecreasing, acceleration is in the direction opposite to that of the velocity.  This\nstatement is independent of the choice of the origin and the axis.\n\n5. The sign of acceleration does not tell us whether the particle’s speed is increasing or\ndecreasing.  The sign of acceleration (as mentioned in point 3) depends on the choice\nof the positive direction of the axis.  For example, if the vertically upward direction is\nchosen to be the positive direction of the axis, the acceleration due to gravity is\nnegative.  If a particle is falling under gravity, this acceleration, though negative,\nresults in increase in speed.  For a particle thrown upward, the same negative\nacceleration (of gravity) results in decrease in speed.\n\n6. The zero velocity of a particle at any instant does not necessarily imply zero acceleration\nat that instant.  A particle may be momentarily at rest and yet have non-zero\nacceleration.  For example, a particle thrown up has zero velocity at its uppermost\npoint but the acceleration at that instant continues to be the acceleration due to\ngravity.\n\n7. In the kinematic equations of motion [Eq. (3.11)], the various quantities are algebraic,\ni.e. they may be positive or negative.  The equations are applicable in all situations\n(for one dimensional motion with constant acceleration) provided the values of different\nquantities are substituted in the equations with proper signs.\n\n8. The definitions of instantaneous velocity and acceleration (Eqs. (3.3) and (3.5)) are\nexact and are always correct while the kinematic equations (Eq. (3.11)) are true only\nfor motion in which the magnitude and the direction of acceleration are constant\nduring the course of motion.\n\nEXERCISES\n\n3.1 In which of the following examples of motion, can the body be considered\napproximately a point object:\n(a) a railway carriage moving without jerks between two stations.\n(b) a monkey sitting on top of a man cycling smoothly on a circular track.\n(c) a spinning cricket ball that turns sharply on hitting the ground.\n(d) a tumbling beaker that has slipped off the edge of a table.\n\n3.2 The position-time (x-t) graphs for two children A and B returning from their school\nO to their homes P and Q respectively are shown in Fig. 3.19.

Though you will learn in detail in mathematics about derivatives, we shall introduce\nthis concept in brief in this Appendix so as to facilitate its use in describing physical quantities\ninvolved in motion.\n\nSuppose we have a quantity y whose value depends upon a single variable x, and is expressed\nby an equation defining y as some specific function of x.  This is represented as:\n\n y = f (x) (1)\n\nThis relationship can be visualised by drawing a graph of function y = f (x) regarding y and x as\nCartesian coordinates, as shown in Fig. 3.30 (a).\n\n                             (a)      (b)\nFig.  3.30\n\nConsider the point P on the curve y = f (x) whose coordinates are (x, y) and another point Q\nwhere coordinates are (x + ∆x, y + ∆y).  The slope of the line joining P and Q is given by:\n\n( )\nx\n\nyyy\n\nx\n\ny\ntan\n\n∆\n−∆+\n\n=\n∆\n∆\n\n=θ (2)\n\nSuppose now that the point Q moves along the curve towards P.  In this process, ∆y and ∆x\n\ndecrease and approach zero; though their ratio \n∆\n\n∆\n\ny\n\nx\n  will not necessarily vanish.  What happens\n\nto the line PQ as ∆y→ 0, ∆x→ 0. You can see that this line becomes a tangent to the curve at\npoint P as shown in Fig. 3.30(b).  This means that tan θ  approaches the slope of  the tangent at\nP, denoted by m:\n\n                                \nx 0 0\n\n( )\nlim lim\n\nx\n\ny y y y\nm\n\nx x∆ → ∆ →\n\n∆ + ∆ −\n= =\n\n∆ ∆\n(3)\n\nThe limit of the ratio ∆y/∆x as  ∆x approaches zero is called the derivative of y with respect to x\nand is written as dy/dx. It represents the slope of the tangent line to the curve y = f (x) at the\npoint (x, y).\n\nSince y = f (x) and y + ∆y = f (x + ∆x), we can write the definition of the derivative as:\n\n                    \uf007\n\uf008\n\uf009\n\n\uf00a\n\uf00b\n\uf00c\n\n∆\n∆+\n\n=\n∆\n∆\n\n==\n→∆→∆ x\n\nxfxxf \n \n\nx\n\ny\n \n\n)(\n\nx\n\n)(–)(\nlimlim\n\ndx\n\nd\n\ndx\n\ndy\n\n00x\n\nxf\n\nGiven below are some elementary formulae for derivatives of functions.

The formulae for areas of simple geometrical figures are\nalso known to you.  For example, the area of a rectangle is length times breadth and that of a\ntriangle is half of the product of base and height.  But how to deal with the problem of determination\nof area of an irregular figure?  The mathematical notion of integral is necessary in connection with\nsuch problems.\n\nLet us take a concrete example.  Suppose a variable force f (x) acts on a particle in its motion\nalong x - axis from x = a to x = b.  The problem is to determine the work done (W) by the force on the\nparticle during the motion.  This problem is discussed in detail in Chapter 6.\n\nFigure 3.31 shows the variation of  F(x)  with x.  If the force were constant, work  would  be  simply\nthe area F (b-a) as shown in Fig. 3.31(i).  But in the general case, force is varying .\n\nFig. 3.31\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMOTION IN A STRAIGHT LINE 63\n\nTo calculate the area under this curve  [Fig. 3.31  (ii)], let us employ the following trick.  Divide the\ninterval on x-axis from a to b into a large number (N) of small intervals: x0(=a) to x1, x1 to x2 ; x2 to x3,\n................................ xN-1 to xN (=b). The area under the curve is thus divided into N strips.  Each strip\nis approximately a rectangle, since the variation of  F(x) over a strip is negligible.  The area of the ith\n\nstrip shown [Fig. 3.31(ii)] is then approximately\n\nxxFxxxFA iiiii ∆==∆ )()–)(( 1–\n\nwhere ∆x is the width of the strip which we have taken to be the same for all the strips.  You may\nwonder whether we should put F(xi-1) or the mean of F(xi)  and  F(xi-1) in the above expression.  If we\ntake N to be very very large (N→∞ ),  it does not really matter, since then the strip will be so thin that\nthe difference between  F(xi) and F(xi-1)  is vanishingly small.  The total area under the curve then is:\n\n\uf00d\uf00d\n==\n\n∆=∆=\nN\n\ni\n\ni\n\nN\n\ni\n\ni xxFAA\n\n11\n\n)(\n\nThe limit of this sum as N→∞  is known as the integral of F(x) over x from a to b.

We\n\nfound that the directional aspect of these quantities can be\n\ntaken care of by + and – signs, as in one dimension only two\n\ndirections are possible. But in order to describe motion of an\n\nobject in two dimensions (a plane) or three dimensions\n\n(space), we need to use vectors to describe the above-\n\nmentioned physical quantities.  Therefore, it is first necessary\n\nto learn the language of vectors. What is a vector ? How to\n\nadd, subtract and multiply vectors ? What is the result of\n\nmultiplying a vector by a real number ? We shall learn this\n\nto enable us to use vectors for defining velocity and\n\nacceleration in a plane. We then discuss motion of an object\n\nin a plane.  As a simple case of motion in a plane, we shall\n\ndiscuss motion with constant acceleration and treat in detail\n\nthe projectile motion. Circular motion is a familiar class of\n\nmotion that has a special significance in daily-life situations.\n\nWe shall discuss uniform circular motion in some detail.\n\nThe equations developed in this chapter for motion in a\n\nplane can be easily extended to the case of three dimensions.\n\n4.2  SCALARS AND VECTORS\n\nIn physics, we can classify quantities as scalars or\n\nvectors.  Basically, the difference is that a direction is\nassociated with a vector but not with a scalar.  A scalar\n\nquantity is a quantity with magnitude only. It is specified\n\ncompletely by a single number, along with the proper\n\nunit. Examples are : the distance between two points,\n\nmass of an object, the temperature of a body and the\n\ntime at which a certain event happened.  The rules for\n\ncombining scalars are the rules of ordinary algebra.\n\nScalars can be added, subtracted, multiplied and divided\n\n4.1 Introduction\n\n4.2 Scalars and vectors\n\n4.3 Multiplication of vectors by\nreal numbers\n\n4.4 Addition and subtraction of\nvectors — graphical method\n\n4.5 Resolution of vectors\n\n4.6 Vector addition — analytical\nmethod\n\n4.7 Motion in a plane\n\n4.8 Motion in a plane with\nconstant acceleration\n\n4.9 Relative velocity in two\ndimensions\n\n4.10 Projectile motion\n\n4.11 Uniform circular motion\n\nSummary\n\nPoints to ponder\n\nExercises\n\nAdditional exercises\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS66\n\njust as the ordinary numbers*. For example,\nif the length and breadth of a rectangle are\n1.0 m and 0.5 m respectively, then its\nperimeter is the sum of the lengths of the\nfour sides, 1.0 m + 0.5 m +1.0 m + 0.5 m =\n3.0 m. The length of each side is a scalar\nand the perimeter is also a scalar. Take\nanother example: the maximum and\nminimum temperatures on a particular day\nare 35.6 °C and 24.2 °C respectively.  Then,\nthe difference between the two temperatures\nis 11.4 °C. Similarly, if a uniform solid cube\nof aluminium of side 10 cm has a mass of\n2.7 kg, then its volume is 10–3 m3 (a scalar)\nand its density is 2.7×103 kg m–3 (a scalar).\n\nA vector quantity is a quantity that has both\n\na magnitude and a direction and obeys the\n\ntriangle law of addition or equivalently the\n\nparallelogram law of addition. So, a vector is\n\nspecified by giving its magnitude by a number\n\nand its direction. Some physical quantities that\n\nare represented by vectors are displacement,\n\nvelocity, acceleration and force.\n\nTo represent a vector, we use a bold face type\nin this book. Thus, a velocity vector can be\nrepresented by a symbol v.  Since bold face is\ndifficult to produce, when written by hand, a\nvector is often represented by an arrow placed\n\nover a letter, say \nr\nv . Thus, both v and \n\nr\nv\n\nrepresent the velocity vector. The magnitude of\na vector is often called its absolute value,\nindicated by |v| = v.  Thus, a vector is\nrepresented by a bold face, e.g. by A, a, p, q, r, ...\nx, y, with respective magnitudes denoted by light\nface A, a, p, q, r, ... x, y.\n\n4.2.1  Position and Displacement Vectors\n\nTo describe the position of an object moving in\na plane, we  need to choose a convenient point,\nsay O as origin. Let P and P′ be the positions of\nthe object at time t and t′, respectively [Fig. 4.1(a)].\nWe join O and P by a straight line.  Then, OP is\nthe position vector of the object at time t.  An\narrow is marked at the head of this line.  It is\nrepresented by a symbol r, i.e. OP = r.  Point P′ is\n\nrepresented by another position vector, OP′\ndenoted by r′. The length of the vector r\nrepresents the magnitude of the vector and its\ndirection is the direction in which P lies as seen\nfrom O. If the object moves from P to P′, the\nvector PP′ (with tail at P and tip at P′) is called\nthe displacement vector corresponding to\nmotion from point P (at time t) to point P′ (at time t′).\n\nFig. 4.1 (a) Position and displacement vectors.\n(b) Displacement vector PQ and different\n\n     courses of motion.\n\nIt is important to note that displacement\n\nvector is the straight line joining the initial and\n\nfinal positions and does not depend on the actual\n\npath undertaken by the object between the two\n\npositions.  For example, in Fig. 4.1(b), given the\n\ninitial and final positions as P and Q, the\n\ndisplacement vector is the same PQ for different\n\npaths of journey, say PABCQ, PDQ, and PBEFQ.\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of displacement is\n\neither less or equal to the path length of an\n\nobject between two points. This fact was\nemphasised in the previous chapter also while\n\ndiscussing motion along a straight line.\n\n4.2.2  Equality of Vectors\n\nTwo vectors A and B are said to be equal if, and\n\nonly if, they have the same magnitude and the\n\nsame direction.**\nFigure 4.2(a) shows two equal vectors A and\n\nB. We can easily check their equality.  Shift B\n\nparallel to itself until its tail Q coincides with that\n\nof A, i.e. Q coincides with O. Then, since  their\n\ntips S and P also coincide, the two vectors are\n\nsaid to be equal.  In general, equality is indicated\n\n* Addition and subtraction of scalars make sense only for quantities with same units. However, you can multiply\nand divide scalars of different units.\n\n** In our study, vectors do not have fixed locations. So displacing a vector parallel to itself leaves the vector\nunchanged. Such vectors are called free vectors. However, in some physical applications, location or line of\napplication of a vector is important. Such vectors are called localised vectors.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMOTION IN A PLANE 67\n\nas A = B. Note that in Fig. 4.2(b), vectors A′  and\nB′  have the same magnitude but they are not\nequal because they have different directions.\nEven if we shift B′  parallel to itself so that its tail\nQ′  coincides with the tail O′  of A′ , the tip S′  of B′\ndoes not coincide with the tip P′  of A′ .\n\n4.3 MULTIPLICATION OF VECTORS BY REAL\nNUMBERS\n\nMultiplying a vector A with a positive number λ\ngives a vector whose magnitude is changed by\nthe factor λ but the direction is the same as that\nof A :\n\n\uf8e6 λ A\uf8e6  = λ \uf8e6 A\uf8e6  if λ > 0.\nFor example, if A is multiplied by 2, the resultant\nvector 2A is in the same direction as A and has\n\na magnitude twice of |A| as shown in Fig. 4.3(a).\n\nMultiplying a vector A by a negative number\n−λ gives another vector whose direction is\nopposite to the direction of A and whose\nmagnitude is λ times |A|.\n\nMultiplying a given vector A by negative\nnumbers, say –1 and –1.5, gives vectors as\nshown in Fig 4.3(b).\n\nThe  factor λ by  which  a vector A is multiplied\ncould be a scalar having its own physical\ndimension. Then, the dimension of λ A is the\nproduct of the dimensions of λ and A. For\nexample, if we multiply a constant velocity vector\nby duration (of time), we get a displacement\nvector.\n\n4.4 ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION OF\nVECTORS — GRAPHICAL METHOD\n\nAs mentioned in section 4.2, vectors, by\ndefinition, obey the triangle law or equivalently,\nthe parallelogram law of addition.  We shall now\ndescribe this law of addition using the graphical\nmethod. Let us consider two vectors A and B that\nlie in a plane as shown in Fig. 4.4(a).  The lengths\nof the line segments representing these vectors\nare proportional to the magnitude of the vectors.\nTo find the sum A + B, we place vector B so that\nits tail is at the head of the vector A, as in\nFig. 4.4(b). Then, we join the tail of A to the head\nof B. This line OQ represents a vector R, that is,\nthe sum of the vectors A and B. Since, in this\nprocedure of vector addition, vectors are\n\nFig. 4.2  (a) Two equal vectors A and B.  (b) Two\n\nvectors A′      and B′  are unequal though they\nare of the same length.\n\nFig. 4.3 (a) Vector A and the resultant vector after\nmultiplying A by a positive number 2.\n(b) Vector A and resultant vectors after\nmultiplying it by a negative number –1\nand –1.5.\n\n(c) (d)\n\nFig. 4.4  (a) Vectors A and B. (b) Vectors A and B\nadded graphically. (c) Vectors B and A\nadded graphically. (d) Illustrating the\nassociative law of vector addition.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS68\n\narranged head to tail, this graphical method is\ncalled the head-to-tail method. The two vectors\nand their resultant form three sides of a triangle,\nso this method is also known as triangle method\nof vector addition. If we find the resultant of\nB + A as in Fig. 4.4(c), the same vector R is\nobtained. Thus, vector addition is commutative:\n\nA + B = B + A (4.1)\n\nThe addition of vectors also obeys the associative\nlaw as illustrated in Fig. 4.4(d). The result of\nadding vectors A and B first and then adding\nvector C is the same as the result of adding B\nand C first and then adding vector A :\n\n(A + B) + C = A + (B + C) (4.2)\n\nWhat is the result of adding two equal and\nopposite vectors ? Consider  two  vectors A and\n–A shown in Fig. 4.3(b). Their sum is A + (–A).\nSince the magnitudes of the two vectors are the\nsame, but the directions are opposite, the\nresultant vector has zero magnitude and is\nrepresented by 0 called a null vector or a zero\nvector :\n\nA – A = 0         |0|= 0 (4.3)\n\nSince the magnitude of a null vector is zero, its\ndirection cannot be specified.\n\nThe null vector also results when we multiply\na vector A by the number zero. The main\nproperties of 0 are :\n\nA + 0 = A\nλ 0 = 0\n0 A = 0        (4.4)\n\nFig. 4.5 (a) Two vectors A and B, – B is also shown. (b) Subtracting vector B from vector A – the result is R\n2\n. For\n\ncomparison, addition of vectors A and B, i.e. R\n1\n is also shown.\n\nWhat is the physical meaning of a zero vector?\nConsider the position and displacement vectors\nin a plane as shown in Fig. 4.1(a). Now suppose\nthat an object which is at P at time t, moves to\nP′ and then comes back to P. Then, what is its\ndisplacement? Since the initial and final\npositions coincide, the displacement is a “null\nvector”.\n\nSubtraction of vectors can be defined in terms\nof addition of vectors. We define the difference\nof two vectors A and B as the sum of two vectors\nA and –B :\n\nA – B = A + (–B) (4.5)\n\nIt is shown in Fig 4.5. The vector –B is added to\nvector A to get R\n\n2 \n= (A – B). The vector R\n\n1 \n= A + B\n\nis also shown in the same figure for comparison.\n\nWe can also use the parallelogram method to\nfind the sum of two vectors. Suppose we have\n\ntwo vectors A and B. To add these vectors, we\nbring their tails to a common origin O as\n\nshown in Fig. 4.6(a). Then we draw a line from\nthe head of A parallel to B and another line from\nthe head of B parallel to A to complete a\nparallelogram OQSP.  Now we join the point of\n\nthe intersection of these two lines to the origin\n\nO. The resultant vector R is directed from the\ncommon origin O along  the diagonal (OS) of the\nparallelogram [Fig. 4.6(b)]. In Fig.4.6(c), the\n\ntriangle law is used to obtain the resultant of A\nand B and we see that the two methods yield the\nsame result. Thus, the two methods are\n\nequivalent.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMOTION IN A PLANE 69\n\n\uf074\n\nExample 4.1 Rain is falling vertically with\na speed of 35 m s–1.  Winds starts blowing\nafter sometime with a speed of 12 m s–1 in\neast to west direction.  In which direction\nshould a boy waiting at a bus stop hold\nhis umbrella ?\n\nFig. 4.7\n\nAnswer  The velocity of the rain and the wind\nare represented by the vectors v\n\nr\n and v\n\nw\n in      Fig.\n\n4.7 and are in the direction specified by the\nproblem.  Using the rule of vector addition, we\nsee that the resultant of v\n\nr\n and v\n\nw\n is R as shown\n\nin the figure.  The magnitude of R is\n\nR v v\nr\n\n2\n\nw\n\n2\n= + = + =\n\n− −\n35 12  m s 37 m s\n\n2 2 1 1\n\nThe direction θ  that R makes with the vertical\nis given by\n\n12\ntan 0.343\n\n35\nw\n\nr\n\nv\n \n\nv\nθ = = =\n\nOr,     ( ) θ = = °tan- .1 0 343 19\nTherefore, the boy should hold his umbrella\n\nin the vertical plane at an angle of about 19o\n\nwith the vertical towards the east.\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf074\n\nFig. 4.6 (a) Two vectors A and B with their tails brought to a common origin. (b) The sum A + B obtained using\nthe parallelogram method. (c) The parallelogram method of vector addition is equivalent to the triangle\nmethod.\n\n4.5  RESOLUTION OF VECTORS\n\nLet a and b be any two non-zero vectors in a\nplane with different directions and let A be\nanother vector in the same plane(Fig. 4.8). A can\nbe expressed as a sum of two vectors — one\nobtained by multiplying a by a real number and\nthe other obtained by multiplying b by another\nreal number. To see this, let O and P be the tail\nand head of the vector A. Then, through O, draw\na straight line parallel to a, and through P, a\nstraight line parallel to b. Let them intersect at\nQ. Then, we have\n\nA = OP  = OQ + QP (4.6)\n\nBut since OQ is parallel to a, and QP is parallel\nto b, we can write :\n\nOQ = λ a, and QP = µ b (4.7)\nwhere  λ and µ are real numbers.\n\nTherefore, A = λ a + µ b (4.8)\n\nFig. 4.8 (a) Two non-colinear vectors a and b.\n(b) Resolving a vector A in terms of vectors\n\na and b.\n\nWe say that A has been resolved into two\ncomponent vectors λ a and µ b along a and b\nrespectively. Using this method one can resolve\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS70\n\nFig. 4.9 (a) Unit vectors  \uf001i  , \uf001j  and \uf001k lie along the x-, y-, and z-axes. (b) A vector A is resolved into its\ncomponents A\n\nx \nand A\n\ny\n along x-, and y- axes. (c) A\n\n1\n and  A\n\n2 \nexpressed in terms of \uf001i  and \uf001j .\n\na given vector into two component vectors along\na set of two vectors – all the three lie in the same\nplane. It is convenient to resolve a general vector\nalong the axes of a rectangular coordinate\nsystem using vectors of unit magnitude. These\nare called unit vectors that we discuss now. A\nunit vector is a vector of unit magnitude and\npoints in a particular direction. It has no\ndimension and unit. It is used to specify a\ndirection only. Unit vectors along the x-, y- and\nz-axes of a rectangular coordinate system are\n\ndenoted by \uf001i , \uf001j  and k̂ , respectively, as shown\nin Fig. 4.9(a).\nSince these are unit vectors, we have\n\n\uf8e6 î  \uf8e6 = \uf8e6 ĵ \uf8e6 = \uf8e6 k̂ \uf8e6=1 (4.9)\nThese unit vectors are perpendicular to each\n\nother. In this text, they are printed in bold face\nwith a cap (^) to distinguish them from other\nvectors. Since we are dealing with motion in two\ndimensions in this chapter, we require use of\nonly two unit vectors. If we multiply a unit vector,\n\nsay n̂ by a scalar, the result is a vector\n\nλλλλλ = λn̂.  In general, a vector A can be written as\n\nA = |A| n̂ (4.10)\n\nwhere n̂ is a unit vector along A.\n\nWe can now resolve a vector A in terms\nof component vectors that lie along unit vectors\n\nî  and \uf001j.  Consider a vector A that lies in x-y\nplane as shown in Fig. 4.9(b). We draw lines from\nthe head of A perpendicular to the coordinate\naxes as in Fig. 4.9(b), and get vectors A\n\n1\n and A\n\n2\n\nsuch that  A\n1\n + A\n\n2 \n= A. Since A\n\n1\n is parallel to  \uf001i\n\nand A\n2\n is parallel to \n\n\uf001j ,  we have :\n\nA\n1\n= A\n\nx\n \uf001i ,  A2 = Ay \n\n\uf001j (4.11)\n\nwhere A\nx \n and  A\n\ny\n are real numbers.\n\nThus,    A = A\nx  \n\n\uf001i+ Ay \n\uf001j              (4.12)\n\nThis is represented in Fig. 4.9(c). The quantities\nA\n\nx  \nand A\n\ny  \nare called x-, and y- components of the\n\nvector A. Note that A\nx\n is itself not a vector, but\n\nA\nx\n \n\uf001i  is a vector, and so is A\n\ny \n\n\uf001j . Using simple\ntrigonometry, we can express A\n\nx   \nand A\n\ny\n in terms\n\nof the magnitude of A and the angle θ it makes\nwith the x-axis :\n\nA\nx \n = A cos θ\n\nA\ny\n = A sin θ (4.13)\n\nAs is clear from Eq. (4.13), a component of a\nvector can be positive, negative or zero\ndepending on the value of θ.\n\nNow, we have two ways to specify a vector A\nin a plane. It can be specified by :\n(i) its magnitude A and the direction θ it makes\n\nwith the x-axis; or\n(ii) its components A\n\nx\n and A\n\ny\n\nIf A and θ  are given,  A\nx \nand A\n\ny  \ncan be obtained\n\nusing Eq. (4.13). If A\nx  \nand A\n\ny  \n are given, A and θ\n\ncan be obtained as follows :\n\nA A A A\nx\n\n2\n\ny\n\n2 2 2 2 2\n+ = +cos sinθ θ\n\n = A2\n\nOr, A A Ax\n2\n\ny\n2= +      (4.14)\n\nAnd tan , tanθ θ= =\n−\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\ny\n\nx\n\ny\n\nx\n\n1\n\n             (4.15)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMOTION IN A PLANE 71\n\n\uf074\n\nB i j= +B Bx y\n\uf001 \uf001\n\nLet R be their sum. We have\n\nR = A + B\n\n   ( ) ( )= + + +A A B Bx y x y\uf001 \uf001 \uf001 \uf001i j i j (4.19a)\nSince vectors obey the commutative and\n\nassociative laws, we can arrange and regroup\nthe vectors in Eq. (4.19a) as convenient to us :\n\n( ) ( )R i j= + + +A B A Bx x y y\uf001 \uf001 (4.19b)\nSinceR i j= +R Rx y\n\n\uf001 \uf001 (4.20)\n\nwe have, x x x y y yR A B ,  R A B  = + = + (4.21)\nThus, each component of the resultant\n\nvector R is the sum of the corresponding\ncomponents of A and B.\n\nIn three dimensions, we have\n\nA i j k= + +A A Ax y z\n\uf001 \uf001 \uf001\n\nB i j k= + +B B Bx y z\n\uf001 \uf001 \uf001\n\nR A B i j k= + = + +R R Rx y z\n\uf001 \uf001 \uf001\n\nwith R A Bx x x= +\n\nR A By y y= +\n\nR A Bz z z= + (4.22)\n\nThis method can be extended to addition and\nsubtraction of any number of vectors. For\nexample, if vectors a, b and c are given as\n\na i j k= + +a a ax y z\n\uf001 \uf001 \uf001\n\nb i j k= + +b b bx y z\n\uf001 \uf001 \uf001\n\nc i j k= + +c c cx y z\n\uf001 \uf001 \uf001 (4.23a)\n\nthen, a vector T = a + b – c has components :\n\nT a b c\nx x x x\n\n= + −\n\nT a b cy y y y= + − (4.23b)\n\nT a b cz z z z= + − .\n\nExample 4.2 Find the magnitude and\ndirection of the resultant of two vectors A\nand B in terms of their magnitudes and\nangle θ between them.\n\nFig. 4.9 (d) A vector A resolved into components along\n\nx-, y-, and z-axes\n\n* Note that angles α, β, and γ are angles in space.

The same procedure can be used\nto resolve a general vector A into three\ncomponents along x-, y-, and z-axes in three\n\ndimensions. If α, β, and γ are the angles*\nbetween A and the x-, y-, and z-axes, respectively\n[Fig. 4.9(d)], we have\n\n(d)\n\nx y zA A cos ,  A A cos ,  A A cos  α β γ= = = (4.16a)\nIn general, we have\n\nˆ ˆ ˆ\nx y zA A A= + +A i j k (4.16b)\n\nThe magnitude of vector A is\n2 22\n\nx y zA A A A= + + (4.16c)\n\nA position vector r can be expressed as\n\nr i j k= + +x y z \uf001 \uf001 \uf001 (4.17)\n\nwhere x, y, and z are the components of r along\n\nx-, y-,  z-axes, respectively.\n\n4.6 VECTOR ADDITION – ANALYTICAL\nMETHOD\n\nAlthough the graphical method of adding vectors\n\nhelps us in visualising the vectors and the\n\nresultant vector, it is sometimes tedious and has\n\nlimited accuracy.

Over an\ninterval of time, the average acceleration will\nequal this constant value.

We follow the method used in the one-\ndimensional case. Let r\n\no\n and r be the position\n\nvectors of the particle at time 0 and t and let the\nvelocities at these instants be v\n\no\n and v. Then,\n\nover this time interval t, the average velocity is\n(v\n\no\n + v)/2.

That is, motion in\na plane (two-dimensions) can be treated as two\nseparate simultaneous one-dimensional\nmotions with constant acceleration along two\nperpendicular directions.  This is an important\nresult and is useful in analysing motion of objects\nin two dimensions. A similar result holds for three\ndimensions. The choice of perpendicular\ndirections is convenient in many physical\nsituations, as we shall see in section 4.10 for\nprojectile motion.\n\nExample 4.5 A particle starts from origin\nat t = 0 with a velocity 5.0 î m/s and moves\nin x-y plane under action of a force which\nproduces a constant acceleration of\n\n(3.0i\uf024\uf024\uf024\uf024\uf024+2.0j\uf024\uf024\uf024\uf024\uf024 ) m/s2.

Suppose that two objects\nA and B are moving with velocities v\n\nA\n and v\n\nB\n\n(each with respect to some common frame of\nreference, say ground.). Then, velocity of object\nA relative to that of B is :\n\nv\nAB \n\n= v\nA \n– v\n\nB\n(4.35a)\n\nand similarly, the velocity of object B relative to\nthat of A is :\n\nv\nBA  \n\n=  v\nB \n\n–\n  \nv\n\nA\n\nTherefore, v\nAB   \n\n= – v\nBA\n\n        (4.35b)\n\nand, v vAB BA= (4.35c)\n\nExample 4.6   Rain is falling vertically with\na speed of 35 m s–1. A woman rides a bicycle\nwith a speed of 12 m s–1  in east to west\ndirection. What is the direction in which\nshe should hold her umbrella ?\n\nAnswer  In  Fig. 4.16 v\nr  \nrepresents the velocity\n\nof rain and v\nb \n, the velocity of  the bicycle, the\n\nwoman is riding. Both these velocities are with\nrespect to the ground. Since the woman is riding\na bicycle, the velocity of rain as  experienced by\n\nFig. 4.16\n\nher is the velocity of rain relative to the velocity\nof the bicycle she is riding. That is  v\n\nrb \n= v\n\nr \n–\n\n  \nv\n\nb\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMOTION IN A PLANE 77\n\nThis relative velocity vector as shown in\nFig. 4.16 makes an angle θ  with the vertical. It is\ngiven by\n\ntan \n12\n\n35\n0.343  θ = = =\n\nv\n\nv\n\nb\n\nr\n\nOr,      θ ≅ 19\n\uf001\n\nTherefore, the woman should hold her\n\numbrella at an angle of about 19° with the\n\nvertical towards the west.\n\nNote carefully the difference between this\n\nExample and the Example 4.1. In Example 4.1,\n\nthe boy experiences the resultant (vector\n\nsum) of two velocities while in this example,\n\nthe woman experiences the velocity of rain\n\nrelative to the bicycle (the vector difference\n\nof the two velocities). \uf074\n\n4.10  PROJECTILE MOTION\n\nAs an application of the ideas developed in the\n\nprevious sections, we consider the motion of a\n\nprojectile. An object that is in flight after being\n\nthrown or projected is called a projectile.  Such\n\na projectile might be a football, a cricket ball, a\n\nbaseball or any other object. The motion of a\n\nprojectile may be thought of as the result of two\n\nseparate, simultaneously occurring components\n\nof motions. One component is along a horizontal\n\ndirection without  any acceleration and the other\n\nalong the vertical direction with constant\n\nacceleration due to the force of gravity. It was\n\nGalileo who first stated this independency of the\n\nhorizontal and the vertical components of\n\nprojectile motion in his Dialogue on the great\n\nworld systems (1632).\n\nIn our discussion, we shall assume that the\n\nair resistance has negligible effect on the motion\n\nof the projectile. Suppose that the projectile is\n\nlaunched with velocity v\no\n that makes an angle\n\nθ\no\n with  the x-axis as shown in Fig. 4.17.\n\nAfter the object has been projected, the\n\nacceleration acting on it is that due to gravity\n\nwhich is directed vertically downward:\n\na j= −g \uf002\n\nOr, a\nx\n = 0, a\n\ny\n = – g (4.36)\n\nThe components of initial velocity v\no\n are :\n\nv\nox \n\n= v\no\n cos θo\n\nv\noy\n\n= v\no\n sin θo       (4.37)\n\nIf we take the initial position to be the origin of\nthe reference frame as shown in Fig. 4.17, we\nhave :\n\nx\no \n= 0, y\n\no\n = 0\n\nThen, Eq.(4.34b) becomes :\n\nx = v\nox \n\nt = (v\no\n cos θ\n\no \n) t\n\nand y = (v\no\n sin θ\n\no\n ) t – ( ½ )g t2       (4.38)\n\nThe components of velocity at time t can be\nobtained using Eq.(4.33b) :\n\nv\nx\n = v\n\nox\n = v\n\no\n cos θ\n\no\n\nv\ny = vo sin θo – g t (4.39)\n\nEquation (4.38) gives the x-, and y-coordinates\n\nof the position of a projectile at time t in terms of\n\ntwo parameters — initial speed v\no\n and projection\n\nangle θ\no\n. Notice that the choice of mutually\n\nperpendicular x-, and y-directions for the\n\nanalysis of the projectile motion has resulted in\n\na simplification. One of the components of\n\nvelocity, i.e. x-component remains constant\n\nthroughout the motion and only the\n\ny- component changes, like an object in free fall\n\nin vertical direction.  This is shown graphically\n\nat few instants in Fig. 4.18. Note that at the point\n\nof maximum height, v\ny\n= 0 and therefore,\n\nθ = =−tan 01\nv\n\nv\n\ny\n\nx\n\nEquation of path of a projectile\n\nWhat is the shape of the path followed by the\nprojectile?  This can be seen by eliminating the\ntime between the expressions for x and y as\ngiven in Eq. (4.38).  We obtain:\n\nFig 4.17   Motion of an object projected with velocity\nv\n\no\n at angle θ\n\n0\n.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS78\n\n\uf074\n\n\uf074\n\n( )\n( )\n\n2\no 2\n\no o\n\ntan \n2 cos\n\ng\ny x x\n\nv\nθ\n\nθ\n= −\n\n(4.40)\n\nNow, since g, θ\no \nand v\n\no\n are constants, Eq. (4.40)\n\nis of the form y = a x + b x2, in which a and b are\nconstants.  This is the equation of a parabola,\ni.e. the path of the projectile is a parabola\n(Fig. 4.18).\n\nFig. 4.18  The path of a projectile is a parabola.\n\nTime of maximum height\n\nHow much time does the projectile take to reach\n\nthe maximum height ?  Let this time be denoted\n\nby t\nm\n.  Since at this point, v\n\ny\n= 0, we have from\n\nEq. (4.39):\n\nv\ny\n = v\n\no\n sinθ\n\no\n – g t\n\nm\n = 0\n\nOr, t\nm\n = v\n\no\n sinθ\n\no \n/g                (4.41a)\n\nThe total time T\nf  \nduring which the projectile is\n\nin flight can be obtained by putting y = 0 in\n\nEq. (4.38). We get :\n\nT\nf\n = 2 (v\n\no\n sin θ\n\no\n )/g                  (4.41b)\n\nT\nf\n  is known as the time of flight of the projectile.\n\nWe note that T\nf\n  = 2 t\n\nm \n, which is expected\n\nbecause of the symmetry of the parabolic path.\n\nMaximum height of a projectile\n\nThe maximum height h\nm\n reached by the\n\nprojectile can be calculated by substituting\n\nt = t\nm\n in Eq.

It is the distance travelled\nduring the time of flight T\n\nf\n  . Therefore, the range\n\nR is\nR  = (v\n\no\n cos θ\n\no\n) (T\n\nf \n)\n\n    =(v\no\n cos θ\n\no\n)  (2 v\n\no\n sin θ\n\no\n)/g\n\nOr, R\nv\n\ng\n\n0\n\n2\n\n=\n sin 2 0θ\n\n(4.43a)\n\nEquation (4.43a) shows that for a given\nprojection velocity v\n\no \n, R is maximum when sin\n\n2θ\n0\n is maximum, i.e., when θ\n\n0\n = 450.\n\nThe maximum horizontal range is, therefore,\n\nR\nv\n\ng\nm\n\n0\n\n2\n\n=     (4.43b)\n\nExample 4.7 Galileo, in his book Two new\nsciences, stated that “for elevations which\nexceed or fall short of 45° by equal\namounts, the ranges are equal”.

The word “uniform”\nrefers to the speed, which is uniform (constant)\nthroughout the motion.  Suppose an object is\nmoving with uniform speed v in a circle of radius\nR as shown in Fig. 4.19. Since the velocity of the\nobject is changing continuously in direction, the\nobject undergoes acceleration. Let us find the\nmagnitude and the direction of this acceleration.\n\nNeglecting air resistance - what does\nthe assumption really mean?\n\nWhile treating the topic of projectile motion,\nwe have stated that we assume that the\nair resistance has no effect on the motion\nof the projectile. You must understand what\nthe statement really means. Friction, force\ndue to viscosity, air resistance are all\ndissipative forces. In the presence of any of\nsuch forces opposing motion, any object will\nlose some part of its initial energy and\nconsequently, momentum too. Thus, a\nprojectile that traverses a parabolic path\nwould certainly show deviation from its\nidealised trajectory in the presence of air\nresistance. It will not hit the ground with\nthe same speed with which it was projected\nfrom it. In the absence of air resistance, the\nx-component of the velocity remains\nconstant and it is only the y-component that\nundergoes a continuous change. However,\nin the presence of air resistance, both of\nthese would get affected. That would mean\nthat the range would be less than the one\ngiven by Eq. (4.43). Maximum height\nattained would also be less than that\npredicted by Eq. (4.42). Can you then,\nanticipate the change in the time of flight?\n\nIn order to avoid air resistance, we will\nhave to perform the experiment in vacuum\nor under low pressure, which is not easy.\nWhen we use a phrase like ‘neglect air\nresistance’, we imply that the change in\nparameters such as range, height etc. is\nmuch smaller than their values without air\nresistance. The calculation without air\nresistance is much simpler than that with\nair resistance.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS80\n\nLet r and r′ be the position vectors and v and\nv′ the velocities of the object when it is at point P\nand P ′ as shown in Fig. 4.19(a).  By definition,\nvelocity at a point is along the tangent at that\npoint in the direction of motion. The velocity\nvectors v and v′ are as shown in Fig. 4.19(a1).\n∆v is obtained in Fig. 4.19 (a2) using the triangle\nlaw of vector addition. Since the path is circular,\nv is perpendicular to r and so is v′ to r′.\nTherefore, ∆v is perpendicular to ∆r. Since\n\naverage acceleration is along ∆v a\nv\n\n=\n\uf001\n\n\uf002\n\uf003\n\n\uf004\n\n\uf005\n\uf006\n\n∆\n\n∆t\n, the\n\naverage acceleration a  is perpendicular to ∆r. If\nwe place ∆v on the line that bisects the angle\nbetween r and r′, we see that it is directed towards\nthe centre of the circle. Figure 4.19(b) shows the\nsame quantities for smaller time interval. ∆v and\nhence a  is again directed towards the centre.\n\nIn Fig. 4.19(c), ∆t\uf08e 0 and the average\nacceleration becomes the instantaneous\nacceleration. It is directed towards the centre*.\nThus, we find that the acceleration of an object\nin uniform circular motion is always directed\ntowards the centre of the circle. Let us now find\nthe magnitude of the acceleration.\n\nThe magnitude of a is, by definition, given by\n\na\nv\n\n=\n→∆\n\n∆\n∆t 0 t\n\nLet the angle between position vectors r and\n\nr′ be ∆θ.   Since the velocity vectors v and v′ are\nalways perpendicular to the position vectors, the\n\nangle between them is also ∆θ . Therefore, the\ntriangle CPP ′ formed by the position vectors and\nthe triangle GHI formed by the velocity vectors\nv, v′ and ∆v are similar (Fig. 4.19a).  Therefore,\nthe ratio of the base-length to side-length for\none of the triangles is equal to that of the other\ntriangle. That is :\n\n∆ ∆v r\n\nv R\n=\n\nOr, ∆\n∆\n\nv\nr\n\n= v\nR\n\nTherefore,\n\n  a\nv r r\n\n=\n→\n\n=\n→\n\n=\n→∆\n\n∆\n\n∆ ∆\n\n∆\n\n∆ ∆\n\n∆\n\n∆t 0 0 R R 0t t\n\nv\n\nt\n\nv\n\nt t\n\nIf ∆t is small, ∆θ will also be small and then arc\nPP′ can be approximately taken to be|∆r|:\n\n∆ ∆r ≅ v t\n\n           \n∆\n∆\nr\n\nt\nv≅\n\nOr,\n∆\n\n∆\n\n∆t 0 t\nv\n\n→\n=\n\nr\n\nTherefore, the centripetal acceleration a\nc\n is :\n\nFig. 4.19 Velocity and acceleration of an object in uniform circular motion.  The time interval ∆t decreases from\n(a) to (c) where it is zero.  The acceleration is directed, at each point of the path, towards the centre of\n\nthe circle.\n\n * In the limit ∆t\uf08e0, ∆r becomes perpendicular to r. In this limit ∆v→ 0 and is consequently also perpendicular\n    to  V. Therefore, the acceleration is directed towards the centre, at each point of the circular path.\n\nlim\n\nlimlim lim\n\nlim\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMOTION IN A PLANE 81\n\n\uf074\n\na\nc\n  =   \n\nv\n\nR\n\n\uf001 \uf004\n\uf003 \uf006\n\uf002 \uf005\n\nv = v2/R (4.44)\n\nThus, the acceleration of an object moving with\n\nspeed v in a circle of radius R has a magnitude\n\nv\n2\n/R and is always directed towards the centre.\n\nThis is why this acceleration is called centripetal\nacceleration (a term proposed by Newton). A\nthorough analysis of centripetal acceleration was\nfirst published in 1673 by the Dutch scientist\nChristiaan Huygens (1629-1695) but it was\nprobably known to Newton also some years earlier.\n“Centripetal” comes from a Greek term which means\n‘centre-seeking’.  Since v and R are constant, the\nmagnitude of the centripetal acceleration is also\nconstant. However, the direction changes —\npointing always towards the centre.  Therefore, a\ncentripetal acceleration is not a constant vector.\n\nWe have another way of describing the\nvelocity and the acceleration of an object  in\nuniform circular motion.  As the object moves\nfrom P to P′ in time ∆t (= t′ – t), the line CP\n(Fig. 4.19) turns through an angle ∆θ  as shown\nin the figure. ∆θ  is called angular distance.  We\ndefine the angular speed ω (Greek letter omega)\nas the time rate of change of angular\ndisplacement :\n\nω\nθ\n\n=\n∆\n\n∆t      (4.45)\n\nNow, if the distance travelled by the object\nduring the time ∆t is ∆s, i.e. PP′ is ∆s, then :\n\nv\ns\n\nt\n=\n\n∆\n∆\n\nbut ∆s = R ∆θ. Therefore :\n\nv R\nt\n\n= =\n∆\n\n∆\n\nθ\nωR \n\nv =  R ω (4.46)\n\nWe can express centripetal acceleration a\nc\n in\n\nterms of angular speed :\n\na\nv\n\nR\n\nR\n\nR\nRc = = =\n\n2 2\n2ω\n\nω\n2\n\na Rc = ω\n2 (4.47)\n\nThe time taken by an object to make one revolution\nis known as its time period T and the number of\nrevolution made in one second is called its\nfrequency ν (=1/T ).  However, during this time the\ndistance moved by the object is s = 2πR.\nTherefore, v = 2πR/T =2πRν (4.48)\nIn terms of frequency ν, we have\n\nω = 2πν\n           v = 2πRν\n\na\nc\n = 4π2 ν2R                                       (4.49)\n\nExample 4.10 An insect trapped in a\ncircular groove of radius 12 cm moves along\nthe groove steadily and completes 7\nrevolutions in 100 s. (a) What is the\nangular speed, and the linear speed of the\nmotion? (b) Is the acceleration vector a\nconstant vector ? What is its magnitude ?\n\nAnswer  This is an example of uniform circular\nmotion. Here R = 12 cm. The angular speed ω is\ngiven by\n\nω = 2π/T = 2π × 7/100 = 0.44 rad/s\nThe linear speed v is :\n\nv =ω R = 0.44 s-1 × 12 cm =  5.3 cm s-1\n\nThe direction of velocity v is along the tangent\nto the circle at every point. The acceleration is\ndirected towards the centre of the circle. Since\nthis direction changes continuously,\nacceleration here is not a constant vector.\nHowever, the magnitude of acceleration is\nconstant:\n\na = ω2 R = (0.44 s–1)2 (12 cm)\n\n         = 2.3 cm s-2 \uf074\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS82\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. Scalar quantities are quantities with magnitudes only.  Examples are distance, speed,\nmass and  temperature.\n\n2. Vector quantities are quantities with magnitude and direction both.  Examples are\ndisplacement, velocity and  acceleration. They obey special rules of vector algebra.\n\n3. A vector A multiplied by a real number λ  is also a vector, whose magnitude is λ times\nthe magnitude of the vector A and whose direction is the same or opposite depending\n\nupon whether λ is positive or negative.\n4. Two vectors A and B may be added graphically using head-to-tail method or parallelogram\n\nmethod.\n5. Vector addition is commutative :\n\nA + B = B + A\nIt also obeys the associative law :\n\n(A + B) + C = A + (B + C)\n6. A null or zero vector is a vector with zero magnitude.  Since the magnitude is zero, we\n\ndon’t have to specify its direction.  It has the properties :\nA + 0 = A\n\n     λ0 = 0\n   0 A = 0\n\n7. The subtraction of vector B from A is defined as the sum of A and –B :\nA – B = A+ (–B)\n\n8. A vector A can be resolved into component along two given vectors a and b lying in the\nsame plane :\n\nA = λ a + µ b\nwhere λ and µ  are real numbers.\n\n9.

A vector A can be expressed as\n\nA i + j= A Ax y\n\uf001 \uf001\n\nwhere A\nx\n, A\n\ny\n are its components along x-, and y -axes.

If an object is\nprojected with initial velocity v\n\no\n making an angle θ\n\no\n with x-axis and if we assume its\n\ninitial position to coincide with the origin of the coordinate system, then the position\nand velocity of the projectile at time t are given by :\n\nx = (v\no\n cos θ\n\no\n) t\n\n                  y = (v\no \nsin θ\n\no\n) t − (1/2) g t2\n\nv\nx\n = v\n\nox\n = v\n\no\n cos θ\n\no\n\nv\ny\n = v\n\no\n sin θ\n\no\n − g t\n\n       The path of a projectile is parabolic and is given by :\n\n( )\n( )\n\n2\n\n0 2\ntan\n\ncoso o\n\ngx\ny x –\n\n2 v\nθ\n\nθ\n=\n\n       The maximum height that a projectile attains is :\n\nlim\n\nlim\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS84\n\nh\nv\n\n2g\nm\n\no o\n=\n\n( ) sin\n2\n\nq\n\nThe time taken to reach this height is :\n\ng\n\nv\nt oom\n\nθsin \n=\n\nThe horizontal distance travelled by a projectile from its initial position to the position\nit passes y = 0 during its fall is called the range, R of the projectile.

The magnitude of its acceleration is   a\n\nc\n = v2 /R. The\n\ndirection of a\nc\n is always towards the centre of the circle.\n\nThe angular speed ω, is the rate of change of angular distance. It is related to velocity\nv by   v = ω R.  The acceleration is a\n\nc\n = ω 2R.\n\nIf T is the time period of revolution of the object in circular motion and ν is its\nfrequency, we have ω = 2π ν, v = 2πνR,  a\n\nc\n = 4π2ν2R\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMOTION IN A PLANE 85\n\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n\n1. The path length traversed by an object between two points is, in general, not the same as\nthe magnitude of displacement. The displacement depends only on the end points; the\npath length (as the name implies) depends on the actual path. The two quantities are\nequal only if the object does not change its direction during the course of motion. In all\nother cases, the path length is greater than the magnitude of displacement.\n\n2. In view of point 1 above, the average speed of an object is greater than or equal to the\nmagnitude of the average velocity over a given time interval. The two are equal only if the\npath length is equal to the magnitude of displacement.\n\n3. The vector equations (4.33a) and (4.34a) do not involve any choice of axes. Of course,\nyou can always resolve them along any two independent axes.\n\n4. The kinematic equations for uniform acceleration do not apply to the case of uniform\ncircular motion since in this case the magnitude of acceleration is constant but its\ndirection is changing.\n\n5. An object subjected to two velocities v\n1\n and v\n\n2\n has a resultant velocity v = v\n\n1\n + v\n\n2\n. Take\n\ncare to distinguish it from velocity of object 1 relative to velocity of object 2 : v\n12\n\n= v\n1\n − v\n\n2\n.\n\nHere v\n1\n and v\n\n2\n are velocities with reference to some common reference frame.\n\n6. The resultant acceleration of an object in circular motion is towards the centre only if\nthe speed is constant.\n\n7. The shape of the trajectory of the motion of an object is not determined by the acceleration\nalone but also depends on the initial conditions of motion ( initial position and initial\nvelocity). For example, the trajectory of an object moving under the same acceleration\ndue to gravity can be a straight line or a parabola depending on the initial conditions.\n\nEXERCISES\n\n4.1 State, for each of the following physical quantities, if it is a scalar or a vector :\nvolume, mass, speed, acceleration, density, number of moles, velocity, angular\nfrequency, displacement, angular velocity.\n\n4.2 Pick out the two scalar quantities in the following list :\nforce, angular momentum, work, current, linear momentum, electric field, average\nvelocity, magnetic moment, relative velocity.\n\n4.3 Pick out the only vector quantity in the following list :\nTemperature, pressure, impulse, time, power, total path length, energy, gravitational\npotential, coefficient of friction, charge.\n\n4.4 State with reasons, whether the following algebraic operations with scalar and vector\nphysical quantities are meaningful :\n(a) adding any two scalars, (b) adding a scalar to a vector of the same dimensions ,\n(c) multiplying any vector by any scalar, (d) multiplying any two scalars, (e) adding any\ntwo vectors, (f) adding a component of a vector to the same vector.\n\n4.5 Read each statement below carefully and state with  reasons, if it is true or false :\n(a) The magnitude of a vector is always a scalar, (b) each component of a vector is\nalways a scalar, (c) the total path length is always equal to the magnitude of the\ndisplacement vector of a particle.

We saw that\nuniform motion needs the concept of velocity alone whereas\nnon-uniform motion requires the concept of acceleration in\naddition.  So far, we have not asked the question as to what\ngoverns the motion of bodies. In this chapter, we turn to this\nbasic question.\n\nLet us first guess the answer based on our common\nexperience. To move a football at rest, someone must kick it.\nTo throw a stone upwards, one has to  give it an upward\npush.  A breeze causes the branches of a tree to swing; a\nstrong wind can even move heavy objects. A boat moves in a\nflowing river without anyone rowing it. Clearly, some external\nagency is needed to provide force to move a body from rest.\nLikewise, an external force is needed also to retard or stop\nmotion.  You can stop a ball rolling down an inclined plane by\napplying a force against the direction of its motion.\n\nIn these examples, the external agency of force (hands,\nwind, stream, etc) is in contact with the object. This is not\nalways necessary. A stone released from the top of a building\naccelerates downward due to the gravitational pull of the\nearth.  A bar magnet can attract an iron nail from a distance.\nThis shows that external agencies (e.g. gravitational and\nmagnetic forces )  can exert  force on a body even from a\ndistance.\n\nIn short, a force is required to put a stationary body in\nmotion or stop a moving body, and some external agency is\nneeded to provide this force. The external agency may or may\nnot be in contact with the body.\n\nSo far so good. But what if a body is moving uniformly (e.g.\na skater moving straight with constant speed on a horizontal\nice slab) ?  Is an external force required to keep a body in\nuniform motion?\n\n5.1 Introduction\n\n5.2 Aristotle’s fallacy\n\n5.3 The law of inertia\n\n5.4 Newton’s first law of motion\n\n5.5 Newton’s second law of\nmotion\n\n5.6 Newton’s third law of motion\n\n5.7 Conservation of momentum\n\n5.8 Equilibrium of a particle\n\n5.9 Common forces in mechanics\n\n5.10 Circular motion\n\n5.11 Solving problems in\nmechanics\n\nSummary\n\nPoints to ponder\n\nExercises\n\nAdditional exercises\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS90\n\n5.2  ARISTOTLE’S  FALLACY\n\nThe question posed above appears to be simple.\nHowever, it took ages to answer it. Indeed, the\ncorrect answer to this question given by Galileo\nin the seventeenth century was the foundation\nof Newtonian mechanics, which signalled the\nbirth of modern science.\n\nThe Greek thinker,  Aristotle (384 B.C– 322\nB.C.), held the view that if a body is moving,\nsomething external is required to keep it moving.\nAccording to this view, for example, an arrow\nshot from a bow keeps flying since the air behind\nthe arrow keeps pushing it. The view was part of\nan elaborate framework of ideas developed by\nAristotle on the motion of bodies in the universe.\nMost of the Aristotelian ideas on motion are now\nknown to be wrong and need not concern us.\nFor our purpose here, the Aristotelian law of\nmotion may be phrased thus: An external force\nis required  to keep a body in motion.\n\nAristotelian law of motion is flawed, as we shall\nsee.  However, it is a natural view that anyone\nwould hold from common experience. Even a\nsmall child playing with a simple (non-electric)\ntoy-car on a floor knows intuitively that it needs\nto constantly drag the string attached to the toy-\ncar with some force to keep it going.  If it releases\nthe string, it comes to rest. This experience is\ncommon to most terrestrial motion. External\nforces seem to be needed to keep bodies in\nmotion. Left to themselves, all bodies eventually\ncome to rest.\n\nWhat is the flaw in Aristotle’s argument? The\nanswer is: a moving toy car comes to rest because\nthe external force of friction on the car by the floor\nopposes its motion. To counter this force, the child\nhas to apply an external force on the car in the\ndirection of motion.  When the car is in uniform\nmotion, there is no net external force acting on it:\nthe force by the child cancels the force ( friction)\nby the floor.  The corollary is: if there were no friction,\nthe child would not be required to apply any force\nto keep the toy car in uniform motion.\n\nThe opposing forces such as friction (solids)\nand viscous forces (for fluids) are always present\nin the natural world.  This explains why forces\nby external agencies are necessary to overcome\nthe frictional forces to keep bodies in uniform\nmotion. Now we understand  where Aristotle\nwent wrong.  He coded this practical experience\nin the form of a basic argument.  To get at the\n\ntrue law of nature for forces and motion, one has\nto imagine a world in which uniform motion is\npossible with no frictional forces opposing. This\nis what Galileo did.\n\n5.3  THE LAW OF INERTIA\n\nGalileo studied motion of objects on an inclined\nplane.  Objects (i) moving down an inclined plane\naccelerate, while those (ii) moving up retard.\n(iii )  Motion on a horizontal plane  is an\nintermediate situation.  Galileo concluded that\nan object moving on a frictionless horizontal\nplane must neither have acceleration nor\nretardation, i.e. it should move with constant\nvelocity (Fig. 5.1(a)).\n\n(i) (ii) (iii)\nFig. 5.1(a)\n\nAnother experiment by Galileo leading to the\nsame conclusion involves a double inclined plane.\nA ball released from rest on one of the planes rolls\ndown and climbs up the other. If the planes are\nsmooth, the final height of the ball is nearly the\nsame as the initial height (a little less but never\ngreater). In the ideal situation, when friction is\nabsent, the final height of the ball is the same\nas its initial height.\n\nIf the slope of the second plane is decreased\nand the experiment repeated, the ball will still\nreach the same height, but in doing so, it will\ntravel a longer distance.  In the limiting case, when\nthe slope of the second plane is zero (i.e. is a\nhorizontal) the ball travels an infinite distance.\nIn other words, its motion never ceases. This is,\nof course, an idealised situation (Fig. 5.1(b)).\n\nFig. 5.1(b) The law of inertia was inferred by Galileo\nfrom observations of motion of a ball on a\n\ndouble inclined plane.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nLAWS OF MOTION 91\n\nIn practice, the ball does come to a stop after\nmoving a finite distance on the horizontal plane,\nbecause of the opposing force of friction which\ncan never be totally eliminated.  However, if there\nwere no friction, the ball would continue  to move\nwith a constant velocity on the horizontal plane.\n\nGalileo thus, arrived at a new insight on\nmotion that had eluded Aristotle and those who\nfollowed him.  The state of rest and the state of\nuniform linear motion (motion with constant\nvelocity) are equivalent. In both cases, there is\n\nno net force acting on the body.  It is incorrect to\nassume that a net force is needed to keep a body\nin uniform motion. To maintain a body in\nuniform motion, we need to apply an external\nforce to ecounter the frictional force, so that\nthe two forces sum up to zero net external\nforce.\n\nTo summarise, if the net external force is zero,\na body at rest continues to remain at rest and a\nbody in motion continues to move with a uniform\nvelocity.  This property of the body is called\ninertia. Inertia means ‘resistance to  change’.\nA body does not change its state of rest or\nuniform motion, unless an external force\ncompels it to change that state.\n\n5.4  NEWTON’S FIRST LAW OF MOTION\n\nGalileo’s simple, but revolutionary ideas\ndethroned Aristotelian mechanics. A new\nmechanics had to be developed. This task was\n\nIdeas on Motion in Ancient Indian Science\n\nAncient Indian thinkers had arrived at an elaborate system of ideas on motion. Force, the cause of\nmotion, was thought to be of different kinds : force due to continuous pressure (nodan), as the force\nof wind on a sailing vessel; impact (abhighat), as when a potter’s rod strikes the wheel; persistent\ntendency (sanskara) to move in a straight line(vega) or restoration of shape in an elastic body;\ntransmitted force by a string, rod, etc. The notion of (vega) in the Vaisesika theory of motion perhaps\ncomes closest to the concept of inertia.  Vega, the tendency to move in a straight line, was thought to\nbe opposed by contact with objects including atmosphere, a parallel to the ideas of friction and air\nresistance.  It was correctly summarised that the different kinds of motion (translational, rotational\nand vibrational) of an extended body arise from only the translational motion of its constituent\nparticles. A falling leaf in the wind may have downward motion as a whole (patan) and also rotational\nand vibrational motion (bhraman, spandan), but each particle of the leaf at an instant only has a\ndefinite (small) displacement. There was considerable focus in Indian thought on measurement of\nmotion and units of length and time.  It was known that the position of a particle in space can be\nindicated by distance measured along three axes.  Bhaskara (1150 A.D.) had introduced the concept\nof ‘instantaneous motion’ (tatkaliki gati), which anticipated the modern notion of instantaneous\nvelocity using Differential Calculus. The difference between a wave and a current (of water) was clearly\nunderstood; a current is a motion of particles of water under gravity and fluidity while a wave results\nfrom the transmission of vibrations of water particles.\n\naccomplished almost single-handedly by Isaac\nNewton, one of the greatest scientists of all times.\n\nNewton built on Galileo’s ideas and laid the\nfoundation of mechanics in terms of three laws\nof  motion that go by his name.  Galileo’s law of\ninertia was his starting point which he\nformulated as the first law of motion:\n\nEvery body continues to be in its state\nof rest or of uniform motion in a straight\nline unless compelled by some external\nforce to act otherwise.\n\nThe state of rest or uniform linear motion both\nimply zero acceleration. The first law of motion  can,\ntherefore, be simply expressed as:\nIf the net external force on a body is zero, its\nacceleration is zero.  Acceleration can be non\nzero only if there is a net external force on\nthe body.\n\nTwo kinds of situations are encountered in the\n\napplication of this law in practice. In some\n\nexamples, we know that the net external force\n\non the object is zero. In that case we can\n\nconclude that the acceleration of the object is\n\nzero.  For example, a spaceship out in\n\ninterstellar space, far from all other objects and\n\nwith all its rockets turned off, has no net\n\nexternal force acting on it.  Its acceleration,\n\naccording to the first law, must be zero.  If it is\n\nin motion, it must continue to move with a\n\nuniform velocity.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS92\n\nMore often, however, we do not know all the\n\nforces to begin with.  In that case, if we know\n\nthat an object is unaccelerated (i.e. it is either\n\nat rest or in uniform linear motion), we can infer\n\nfrom the first law that the net external force on\n\nthe object must be zero. Gravity is everywhere.\n\nFor terrestrial phenomena, in particular, every\n\nobject experiences gravitational force due to the\n\nearth.  Also objects in motion generally experience\n\nfriction, viscous drag, etc. If then, on earth, an\n\nobject is at rest or in uniform linear motion, it is\n\nnot because there are no forces acting on it, but\n\nbecause the various external forces cancel out\n\ni.e. add up to zero net external force.\nConsider a book at rest on a horizontal surface\n\nFig. (5.2(a)).  It is subject to two external forces :\nthe force due to gravity (i.e. its weight W) acting\ndownward and the upward force on the book by\nthe table, the normal force R . R is a self-adjusting\nforce. This is an example of the kind of situation\nmentioned above. The forces are not quite known\nfully but the state of motion is known. We observe\nthe book to be at rest.  Therefore, we conclude\nfrom the first law that the magnitude of R equals\nthat of W. A statement often encountered is :\n“Since W = R, forces cancel and, therefore, the book\nis at rest”. This is incorrect reasoning. The correct\nstatement is : “Since the book is observed to be at\nrest, the net external force on it must be zero,\naccording to the first law. This implies that the\n\nGalileo Galilei, born in Pisa, Italy in 1564 was a key figure in the scientific revolution\nin Europe about four centuries ago.  Galileo proposed the concept of acceleration.\nFrom experiments on motion of bodies on inclined planes or falling freely, he\ncontradicted the Aristotelian notion that a force was required to keep a body in\nmotion, and that heavier bodies fall faster than lighter bodies under gravity.  He\nthus arrived at the law of inertia that was the starting point of the subsequent\nepochal work of Isaac Newton.\n\nGalileo’s discoveries in astronomy were equally revolutionary.  In 1609, he designed\nhis own telescope (invented earlier in Holland) and used it to make a number of\nstartling  observations :  mountains  and depressions on  the  surface of the moon;\ndark spots on the sun; the moons of Jupiter and the phases of Venus.  He concluded\nthat the Milky Way derived its luminosity because of a large number of stars not visible to the naked eye.\nIn his masterpiece of scientific reasoning : Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems, Galileo advocated\nthe heliocentric theory of the solar system proposed by Copernicus, which eventually got universal\nacceptance.\n\nWith Galileo came a turning point in the very method of scientific inquiry. Science was no longer\nmerely observations of nature and inferences from them. Science meant devising and doing experiments\nto verify or refute theories. Science meant measurement of quantities and a search for mathematical\n\nrelations between them. Not undeservedly, many regard Galileo as the father of modern science.\n\nnormal force R  must be equal and opposite to the\nweight W ”.\n\nFig. 5.2 (a) a book at rest on the table, and (b) a car\nmoving with uniform velocity. The net force\n\nis zero in each case.\n\nConsider the motion of a car starting from\n\nrest, picking up speed and then moving on a\n\nsmooth straight road with uniform speed (Fig.\n\n(5.2(b)).  When the car is stationary, there is no\n\nnet force acting on it. During pick-up, it\n\naccelerates. This must happen due to a net\n\nexternal force. Note, it has to be an external force.\n\nThe acceleration of the car cannot be accounted\n\nfor by any internal force.  This might sound\n\nsurprising, but it is true.  The only conceivable\n\nexternal force along the road is the force of\n\nfriction.  It is the frictional force that accelerates\n\nthe car as a whole.  (You will learn about friction\n\nin section 5.9).  When the car moves with\n\nconstant velocity, there is no net external force.\n\nGalileo Galilei (1564 - 1642)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nLAWS OF MOTION 93\n\n\uf074\n\nIt relates the net external force to the\nacceleration of the body.\n\nMomentum\nMomentum of a body is defined to be the product\nof its mass m and velocity v, and is denoted\nby p:\n\np = m v             (5.1)\n\nMomentum is clearly a vector quantity.  The\nfollowing common experiences indicate the\nimportance of this quantity for considering the\neffect of force on motion.\n\n• Suppose a light-weight vehicle (say a small\n\ncar) and a heavy weight vehicle (say a loaded\ntruck) are parked on a horizontal road. We all\nknow that a much greater force is needed to\npush the truck than the car to bring them to\nthe same speed in same time.  Similarly, a\ngreater opposing force is needed to stop a\nheavy body than a light body in the same time,\nif they are moving with the same speed.\n\n• If two stones, one light and the other heavy,\n\nare dropped from the top of a building, a\nperson on the ground will find it easier to catch\nthe light stone than the heavy stone.  The\nmass of a body is thus an important\nparameter that determines the effect of force\non its motion.\n\n• Speed is another important parameter to\nconsider. A bullet fired by a gun can easily\npierce human tissue before it stops, resulting\nin casualty.  The same bullet fired with\nmoderate speed will not cause much damage.\nThus for a given mass, the greater the speed,\nthe greater is the opposing force needed to stop\nthe body in a certain time.  Taken together,\nthe product of mass and velocity, that is\nmomentum, is evidently a relevant variable\nof motion. The greater the change in the\nmomentum in a given time, the greater is the\nforce that needs to be applied.\n\n• A seasoned cricketer catches a cricket ball\ncoming in with great speed far more easily\nthan a novice, who can hurt his hands in the\nact.  One reason is that the cricketer allows a\nlonger time for his hands to stop the ball.  As\nyou may have noticed, he draws in the hands\nbackward in the act of catching the ball (Fig.\n5.3).  The novice, on the other hand, keeps\nhis hands fixed and tries to catch the ball\nalmost instantly. He needs to provide a much\ngreater force to stop the ball instantly, and\n\nThe property of inertia contained in the First\n\nlaw is evident in many situations.  Suppose we\nare standing in a stationary  bus and the driver\n\nstarts the bus suddenly. We get thrown\nbackward with a jerk. Why ? Our feet are in touch\nwith the floor. If there were no friction, we would\n\nremain where we were, while the floor of the bus\nwould simply slip forward under our feet and the\n\nback of the bus would hit us.  However,\nfortunately, there is some friction between the\n\nfeet and the floor.  If the start is not too sudden,\ni.e. if the acceleration is moderate, the frictional\nforce would be enough to accelerate our feet\n\nalong with the bus.  But our body is not strictly\na rigid body. It is deformable, i.e. it allows some\n\nrelative displacement between different parts.\nWhat this means is that while our feet go with\nthe bus, the rest of the body remains where it is\n\ndue to inertia.  Relative to the bus, therefore, we\nare thrown backward.  As soon as that happens,\n\nhowever, the muscular forces on the rest of the\nbody (by the feet) come into play to move the body\n\nalong with the bus. A similar thing happens\nwhen the bus suddenly stops.  Our feet stop due\nto the friction which does not allow relative\n\nmotion between the feet and the floor of the bus.\nBut the rest of the body continues to move\n\nforward due to inertia.  We are thrown forward.\nThe restoring muscular forces again come into\nplay and bring the body to rest.\n\nExample 5.1  An astronaut accidentally\ngets separated out of his small spaceship\naccelerating in inter stellar space at a\nconstant rate of 100 m s–2.  What is the\nacceleration of the astronaut the instant after\nhe is outside the spaceship ? (Assume that\nthere are no nearby stars to exert\ngravitational force on him.)\n\nAnswer  Since there are no nearby stars to exert\ngravitational force on him and the small\nspaceship exerts negligible gravitational\nattraction on him, the net force acting on the\nastronaut, once he is out of the spaceship, is\nzero. By the first law of motion the acceleration\nof the astronaut is zero.\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf074\n\n5.5  NEWTON’S SECOND LAW OF MOTION\n\nThe first law refers to the simple case when the\nnet external force on a body is zero.  The second\nlaw of motion refers to the general situation when\nthere is a net external force acting on the body.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS94\n\nthis hurts. The conclusion is clear: force not\nonly depends on the change in momentum,\nbut also on how fast the change is brought\nabout.  The same change in momentum\nbrought about in a shorter time needs a\ngreater applied force. In short, the greater the\nrate of change of momentum, the greater is\nthe force.\n\nFig. 5.3 Force not only depends on the change in\nmomentum but also on how fast the change\n\nis brought about. A seasoned cricketer draws\n\nin his hands during a catch, allowing greater\n\ntime for the ball to stop and hence requires a\n\nsmaller force.\n\n• Observations confirm that the product of\n\nmass and velocity (i.e. momentum) is basic to\n\nthe effect of force on motion.  Suppose a fixed\n\nforce is applied for a certain interval of time\n\non two bodies of different masses, initially at\n\nrest,  the lighter body picks up a greater speed\n\nthan the heavier body.  However, at the end of\n\nthe time interval, observations show that each\n\nbody acquires the same momentum.  Thus\n\nthe same force for the same time causes\n\nthe same change in momentum for\n\ndifferent bodies.  This is a crucial clue to the\n\nsecond law of motion.\n\n• In the preceding observations, the vector\n\ncharacter of momentum has not been evident.\n\nIn the examples so far, momentum and change\n\nin momentum both have the same direction.\n\nBut this is not always the case.  Suppose a\n\nstone is rotated with uniform speed in a\n\nhorizontal plane by means of a string, the\n\nmagnitude of momentum is fixed, but its\n\ndirection changes (Fig. 5.4). A force is needed\n\nto cause this change in momentum vector.\n\nThis force is provided by our hand through\nthe string.  Experience suggests that our hand\nneeds to exert a greater force if the stone is\nrotated at greater speed or in a circle of\nsmaller radius, or both. This corresponds to\ngreater acceleration or equivalently a greater\nrate of change in momentum vector. This\nsuggests that the greater the rate of change\nin momentum vector the greater is the force\napplied.\n\nFig. 5.4 Force is necessary  for changing the direction\nof momentum, even if its magnitude is\n\nconstant. We can feel this while rotating a\n\nstone in a horizontal circle with uniform speed\n\nby means of a string.\n\nThese qualitative observations lead to the\nsecond law of motion expressed by Newton as\nfollows :\n\nThe rate of change of momentum of a body is\ndirectly proportional to the applied force and\ntakes place in the direction in which the force\nacts.\n\nThus, if under the action of a force F for time\ninterval ∆t, the velocity of a body of mass m\nchanges from v to v + ∆v i.e. its initial momentum\n\np = m v changes by m∆ = ∆p v . According to the\n\nSecond Law,\n\n            or     k\nt t\n\n∆ ∆\n∝ =\n\n∆ ∆\n\np p\nF F\n\nwhere k  is a constant of proportionality.  Taking\n\nthe limit ∆t → 0,  the term \nt∆\n\n∆p\n becomes the\n\nderivative or differential co-efficient of p with\n\nrespect to t, denoted by \nd\n\ndt\n\np\n.  Thus\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nLAWS OF MOTION 95\n\n\uf074\n\n    \nd\n\nd\nk\n\nt\n=\n\np\nF (5.2)\n\nFor a body of fixed mass m,\n\n   ( )\nd d d\n\nd d d\nm m m \n\nt t t\n= = =\n\np v\nv a      (5.3)\n\ni.e the Second Law can also be written as\n             F  =   k m a         (5.4)\n\nwhich shows that force is proportional to the\n\nproduct of mass m and acceleration a.\n\nThe unit of force has not been defined so far.\n\nIn fact, we use Eq. (5.4) to define the unit of force.\n\nWe, therefore, have the liberty to choose any\n\nconstant value for k.  For simplicity, we choose\n\nk = 1. The second law then is\n\na\np\n\nF  m\nt\n\n    \nd\n\nd\n  == (5.5)\n\nIn SI unit force is one that causes an acceleration\n\nof 1 m s-2 to a mass of 1 kg. This unit is known as\n\nnewton : 1 N = 1 kg m s-2.\n\nLet us note at this stage some important points\n\nabout the second law :\n\n1. In the second law, F = 0 implies a = 0. The\n\nsecond law is obviously  consistent with the\n\nfirst law.\n\n2. The second law of motion is a vector law. It is\n\nequivalent to three equations, one for each\n\ncomponent of the vectors :\n\nF\np\n\nt\nmax\n\nx\nx= =\n\nd\n\nd\n\nF\np\n\nt\nmay\n\ny\n\ny= =\nd\n\nd\n\nz\nz\n\nz a m\nt\n\np\nF ==\n\nd\n\nd\n                                  (5.6)\n\nThis means that if a force is not parallel to\nthe velocity of the body, but makes some angle\nwith it, it changes only the component of\nvelocity along the direction of force. The\ncomponent of velocity normal to the force\nremains unchanged. For example, in the\nmotion of a projectile under the vertical\ngravitational force, the horizontal component\nof velocity remains unchanged (Fig. 5.5).\n\n3. The second law of motion given by Eq. (5.5) is\napplicable to a single point particle. The force\n\nF in the law stands for the net external force\n\non the particle and a stands for acceleration\n\nof the particle. It turns out, however, that the\n\nlaw in the same form applies to a rigid body or,\n\neven more generally, to a system of particles.\n\nIn that case, F refers to the total external force\n\non the system and a refers to the acceleration\n\nof the system as a whole.  More precisely, a is\n\nthe acceleration of the centre of mass of the\n\nsystem about which we shall study in detail in\n\nchapter 7. Any internal forces in the system\n\nare not to be included in F.\n\nFig. 5.5 Acceleration at an instant is determined by\nthe force at that instant. The moment after a\n\nstone is dropped out of an accelerated train,\n\nit has no horizontal acceleration or force, if\n\nair resistance is neglected. The stone carries\n\nno memory of its acceleration with the train\n\na moment ago.\n\n4. The second law of motion is a local relation\n\nwhich means that force F at a point in space\n\n(location of the particle) at a certain instant\n\nof time is related to a at that point at that\n\ninstant. Acceleration here and now is\n\ndetermined by the force here and now, not by\n\nany history of the motion of the particle\n\n(See Fig. 5.5).\n\nExample 5.2  A bullet of mass 0.04 kg\n\nmoving with a speed of 90 m s–1 enters a\n\nheavy wooden block and is stopped after a\n\ndistance of 60 cm.

For\nexample, when a ball hits a wall and bounces\nback, the force on the ball by the wall acts for a\nvery short time when the two are in contact, yet\nthe force is large enough to reverse the momentum\nof the ball. Often, in these situations, the force\nand the time duration are difficult to ascertain\nseparately. However, the product of force and time,\nwhich is the change in momentum of the body\nremains a measurable quantity. This product is\ncalled impulse:\n\nImpulse  =  Force × time duration\n          =  Change in momentum        (5.7)\n\nA large force acting for a short time to produce a\nfinite change in momentum is called an impulsive\nforce. In the history of science, impulsive forces\nwere put in a conceptually different category from\n\nordinary forces.  Newtonian mechanics has no\nsuch distinction.  Impulsive force is like any other\nforce – except that it is large and acts for a short\ntime.\n\nExample 5.4  A batsman hits back a ball\nstraight in the direction of the bowler without\nchanging its initial speed of 12 m s–1.\nIf the mass of the ball is 0.15 kg, determine\nthe impulse imparted to the ball.  (Assume\nlinear motion of the ball)\n\nAnswer   Change in momentum\n       =  0.15 × 12–(–0.15×12)\n\n      =  3.6 N s,\n\nImpulse  =  3.6 N s,\nin the direction from the batsman to the bowler.\n\nThis is an example where the force on the ball\nby the batsman and the time of contact of the\nball and the bat are difficult to know, but the\nimpulse is readily calculated.\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf074\n\n5.6  NEWTON’S THIRD LAW OF MOTION\n\nThe second law relates the external force on a\n\nbody to its acceleration. What is the origin of the\n\nexternal force on the body ?  What agency\n\nprovides the external force ?  The simple answer\n\nin Newtonian mechanics is that the external\n\nforce on a body always arises due to some other\n\nbody.  Consider a pair of bodies A and B. B gives\n\nrise to an external force on A.  A natural question\n\nis: Does A in turn give rise to an external force\n\non B ?  In some examples, the answer seems\n\nclear.  If you press a coiled spring, the spring is\n\ncompressed by the force of your hand.  The\n\ncompressed spring in turn exerts a force on your\n\nhand and you can feel it.  But what if the bodies\n\nare not in contact ?  The earth pulls a stone\n\ndownwards due to gravity.  Does the stone exert\n\na force on the earth ?  The answer is not obvious\n\nsince we hardly see the effect of the stone on the\n\nearth. The answer according to Newton is: Yes,\n\nthe stone does exert an equal and opposite force\n\non the earth. We do not notice it since the earth\n\nis very massive and the effect of a small force on\n\nits motion is negligible.\n\nThus, according to Newtonian mechanics,\n\nforce never occurs singly in nature. Force is the\n\nmutual interaction between two bodies.  Forces\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nLAWS OF MOTION 97\n\nalways occur in pairs. Further, the mutual forces\n\nbetween two bodies are always equal and\nopposite.  This idea was expressed by Newton in\nthe form of the third law of motion.\n\nTo every action, there is always an equal and\nopposite reaction.\n\nNewton’s wording of the third law is so crisp and\nbeautiful that it has become a part of common\nlanguage. For the same reason perhaps,\nmisconceptions about the third law abound.  Let\nus note some important points about the third\nlaw, particularly in regard to the usage of the\nterms : action and reaction.\n1. The terms action and reaction in the third law\n\nmean nothing else but ‘force’. Using different\nterms for the same physical concept\ncan sometimes be confusing. A simple\nand clear way of stating the third law is as\nfollows :\n\nForces always occur in pairs.  Force on a\nbody A by B is equal and opposite to the\nforce on the body B by A.\n\n2. The terms action and reaction in the third law\nmay give a wrong impression that action\n\ncomes before reaction i.e action is the cause\nand reaction the effect. There is no cause-\neffect relation implied in the third law.  The\nforce on A by B and the force on B by A act\nat the same instant.  By the same reasoning,\nany one of them may be called action and the\nother reaction.\n\n3. Action and reaction forces act on different\nbodies, not on the same body. Consider a pair\nof bodies A and B.  According to the third law,\n\nF\nAB\n\n  =  – F\nBA  \n\n(5.8)\n\n(force on A by B)  =  – (force on B by A)\n\nThus if we are considering the motion of any\n\none body (A or B), only one of the two forces is\n\nrelevant.  It is an error to add up the two forces\n\nand claim that the net force is zero.\n\nHowever, if you are considering the system\n\nof two bodies as a whole, F\nAB\n\n and F\nBA\n\n are\n\ninternal forces of the system (A + B). They add\n\nup to give a null force. Internal forces in a\n\nbody or a system of particles thus cancel away\n\nin pairs.  This is an important fact that\n\nenables the second law to be applicable to a\n\nbody or a system of particles (See Chapter 7).\n\nIsaac Newton (1642 – 1727)\n\nIsaac Newton was born in Woolsthorpe, England in 1642, the year Galileo died.\n\nHis extraordinary mathematical ability and mechanical aptitude remained hidden\n\nfrom others in his school life.   In 1662, he went to Cambridge for undergraduate\n\nstudies.  A plague epidemic in 1665 forced the university town to close and Newton\n\nhad to return to his mother’s farm. There in two years of solitude, his dormant\n\ncreativity blossomed in a deluge of fundamental discoveries in mathematics and\n\nphysics : binomial theorem for negative and fractional exponents, the beginning of\n\ncalculus, the inverse square law of gravitation, the spectrum of white light, and so\n\non. Returning to Cambridge, he pursued his investigations in optics and devised a\n\nreflecting telescope.\n\nIn 1684, encouraged by his friend Edmund Halley, Newton embarked on writing what was to be one of\n\nthe greatest scientific works ever published : The Principia Mathematica.  In it, he enunciated the three\n\nlaws of motion and the universal law of gravitation, which explained all the three Kepler’s laws of\n\nplanetary motion.  The book was packed with a host of path-breaking achievements : basic principles of\n\nfluid mechanics, mathematics of wave motion, calculation of masses of the earth, the sun and other\n\nplanets, explanation of the precession of equinoxes, theory of tides, etc. In 1704, Newton brought out\n\nanother masterpiece Opticks that summarized his work on light and colour.\n\nThe scientific revolution triggered by Copernicus and steered vigorously ahead by Kepler and Galileo\n\nwas brought to a grand completion by Newton. Newtonian mechanics unified terrestrial and celestial\n\nphenomena. The same mathematical equation governed the fall of an apple to the ground and the\n\nmotion of the moon around the earth.  The age of reason had dawned.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS98\n\n\uf074\n\nExample 5.5  Two identical billiard balls\nstrike a rigid wall with the same speed but\nat different angles, and get reflected without\nany change in speed,  as shown in Fig. 5.6.\nWhat is (i) the direction of the force on the\nwall due to each ball? (ii) the ratio of the\nmagnitudes of impulses imparted to the\nballs by the wall ?\n\n       Fig. 5.6\n\nAnswer  An instinctive answer to (i) might be\nthat the force on the wall in case (a) is normal to\nthe wall, while that in case (b) is inclined at 30°\nto the normal. This answer is wrong.  The force\non the wall is normal to the wall in both cases.\n\nHow to find the force on the wall? The trick is\nto consider the force (or impulse) on  the ball\ndue to  the wall using the second law, and then\nuse the third law to answer (i). Let u be the speed\nof each ball before and after collision with the\nwall, and m the mass of each ball. Choose the x\nand y axes as shown in the figure, and consider\nthe change in momentum of the ball in each\ncase :\n\nCase (a)\n\n( ) ( )initial initial 0x yp mu          p= =\n\n( ) ( )finalfinal 0x yp mu          p= − =\n\nImpulse is the change in momentum vector.\nTherefore,\n\nx-component of impulse  =  – 2 m u\ny-component of impulse  =   0\n\nImpulse and force are in the same direction.\nClearly, from above, the force on the ball due to\nthe wall is normal to the wall, along the negative\nx-direction.  Using Newton’s third law of motion,\nthe force on the wall due to the ball is normal to\nthe wall along the positive x-direction. The\n\nmagnitude of force cannot be ascertained since\nthe small time taken for the collision has not\nbeen specified in the problem.\n\nCase (b)\n\n( )  cos 30initialxp m u =\n\uf001 , ( )    sin 30initialyp m u = − \uf001\n\n( )  – cos 30finalxp m u =\n\uf001 , ( )   sin 30finalyp m u = − \uf001\n\nNote,  while p\nx\n changes sign  after collision,  p\n\ny\n\ndoes not.  Therefore,\n\nx-component of impulse = –2 m u  cos  30°\ny-component of impulse = 0\n\nThe direction of impulse (and force) is the same\nas in (a) and is normal to the wall along the\nnegative x direction.  As before, using Newton’s\nthird law, the force on the wall due to the ball is\nnormal to the wall along the positive x direction.\n\nThe ratio of the magnitudes  of the impulses\nimparted to the balls in (a) and (b) is\n\n( )\n2\n\n2 / 2 cos30 1.2\n3\n\nm u m u = ≈\n\uf001 \uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf020\uf074\n\n5.7  CONSERVATION OF MOMENTUM\n\nThe second and third laws of motion lead to\nan important consequence: the law of\nconservation of momentum.  Take a familiar\nexample. A bullet is fired  from a gun. If the force\non the bullet by the gun is F, the force on the gun\nby the bullet is – F, according to the third law.\nThe two forces act for a common interval of time\n∆t.  According to the second law, F ∆t is the\nchange in momentum of the bullet and – F ∆t is\nthe change in momentum of the gun. Since\ninitially, both are at rest, the change in\nmomentum equals the final momentum for each.\nThus if p\n\nb\n is the momentum of the bullet after\n\nfiring and p\ng \nis the recoil momentum of the gun,\n\np\ng\n = – p\n\nb\n  i.e. p\n\nb\n + p\n\ng\n = 0.  That is, the total\n\nmomentum of the (bullet + gun) system is\nconserved.\n\nThus in an isolated system (i.e. a system with\nno external force), mutual forces between pairs\nof particles in the system can cause momentum\nchange in individual particles, but since the\nmutual forces for each pair are equal and\nopposite, the momentum changes cancel in pairs\nand the total momentum remains unchanged.\nThis fact is known as the law of conservation\nof momentum :\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nLAWS OF MOTION 99\n\n\uf074\n\nThe total momentum of an isolated system\n\nof interacting particles is conserved.\n\nAn important example of the application of the\n\nlaw of conservation of momentum is the collision\n\nof two bodies. Consider two bodies A and B, with\n\ninitial momenta p\nA\n and p\n\nB\n. The bodies collide,\n\nget apart, with final momenta p′\nA\n and p′\n\nB\n\nrespectively. By the Second Law\n\nF p pAB A At∆ = ′ −\n \nand\n\nF p pBA B Bt∆ = ′ −\n\n(where we have taken a common interval of time\n\nfor both forces i.e. the time for which the two\n\nbodies are in contact.)\n\nSince F FAB BA= −  by the third law,\n\n( )′ − = − ′ −p p p pA A B B\ni.e. ′ + ′ = +p p p pA B A B   (5.9)\n\nwhich shows that the total final momentum of\n\nthe isolated system equals its initial momentum.\n\nNotice that this is true whether the collision is\n\nelastic or inelastic. In elastic collisions, there is\n\na second condition that the total initial kinetic\n\nenergy of the system equals the total final kinetic\n\nenergy (See Chapter 6).\n\n5.8  EQUILIBRIUM OF A PARTICLE\n\nEquilibrium of a particle in mechanics refers to\n\nthe situation when the net external force on the\n\nparticle is zero.*  According to the first law, this\nmeans that, the particle is either at rest or in\n\nuniform motion.\n\nIf two forces F\n1\n and F\n\n2\n, act on a particle,\n\nequilibrium requires\n\nF\n1  \n\n= −\n \nF\n\n2\n(5.10)\n\ni.e. the two forces on the particle  must be equal\n\nand opposite. Equilibrium under three\n\nconcurrent forces F\n1\n, F\n\n2\n  and F\n\n3\n requires that\n\nthe vector sum of the three forces is zero.\n\nF\n1\n  + F\n\n2\n  + F\n\n3\n  =  0                                  (5.11)\n\n* Equilibrium of a body requires not only translational equilibrium (zero net external force) but also rotational\nequilibrium (zero net external torque), as we shall see in Chapter 7.\n\nFig. 5.7  Equilibrium under concurrent forces.\n\nIn other words, the resultant of any two forces\nsay F\n\n1\n and F\n\n2\n, obtained by the parallelogram\n\nlaw of forces must be equal and opposite to the\nthird force, F\n\n3\n.  As seen in Fig. 5.7, the three\n\nforces in equilibrium can be represented by the\nsides of a triangle with the vector arrows taken\nin the same sense. The result can be\ngeneralised to any number of forces. A particle\nis in equilibrium under the action of forces F\n\n1\n,\n\nF\n2\n,... F\n\nn\n if they can be represented by the sides\n\nof a closed n-sided polygon with arrows directed\nin the same sense.\n\nEquation (5.11) implies that\n\nF\n1x \n\n+ F\n2x \n\n+ F\n3x\n\n = 0\n\nF\n1y\n\n + F\n2y\n\n + F\n3y\n\n = 0\n\nF\n1z\n\n + F\n2z\n\n + F\n3z\n\n = 0       (5.12)\n\nwhere F\n1x\n\n, F\n1y\n\n and F\n1z\n\n are the components of F\n1\n\nalong x, y and z directions respectively.\n\nExample 5.6   See Fig. 5.8. A mass of 6 kg\nis suspended by a  rope  of  length 2 m\nfrom the ceiling.  A force of 50 N in the\nhorizontal direction is  applied  at  the mid-\npoint P of the rope, as shown. What is the\nangle the rope makes with the vertical in\nequilibrium ?  (Take g = 10 m s-2).

The gravitational force is, of course,\npervasive.  Every object on the earth experiences\nthe force of gravity due to the earth. Gravity also\ngoverns the motion of celestial bodies.  The\ngravitational force can act at a distance without\nthe need of any intervening medium.\n\nAll the other forces common in mechanics are\ncontact forces.* As the name suggests, a contact\nforce on an object arises due to contact with some\nother object: solid or fluid. When bodies are in\ncontact (e.g.  a book resting on a table, a system\nof rigid bodies connected by rods, hinges and\n\nother types of supports), there are mutual\ncontact forces (for each pair of bodies) satisfying\nthe third law.  The component of contact force\nnormal to the surfaces in contact is called\nnormal reaction.  The component parallel to the\nsurfaces in contact is called friction.  Contact\nforces arise also when solids are in contact with\nfluids.  For example, for a solid immersed in a\nfluid, there is an upward bouyant force equal to\nthe weight of the fluid displaced. The viscous\nforce, air resistance, etc are also examples of\ncontact forces (Fig. 5.9).\n\nTwo other common forces are tension in a\nstring and the force due to spring. When a spring\nis compressed or extended by an external force,\na restoring force is generated. This force is\nusually proportional to the compression or\nelongation (for small displacements). The spring\nforce F is written as F = – k x where x is the\ndisplacement and k is the force constant. The\nnegative sign denotes that the force is opposite\nto the displacement from the unstretched state.\nFor an inextensible string, the force constant is\nvery high. The restoring force in a string is called\ntension. It is customary to use a constant tension\nT throughout the string. This assumption is true\nfor a string of negligible mass.\n\nIn Chapter 1, we learnt that there are four\nfundamental forces in nature.  Of these, the weak\nand strong forces appear in domains that do not\nconcern us here. Only the gravitational and\nelectrical forces are relevant in the context of\nmechanics. The different contact forces of\nmechanics mentioned above fundamentally arise\nfrom electrical forces.  This may seem surprising\n\n* We are not considering,  for simplicity, charged and magnetic bodies. For these, besides gravity, there are\nelectrical and magnetic non-contact forces.\n\nFig. 5.9  Some examples of contact forces in mechanics.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nLAWS OF MOTION 101\n\nsince we are talking of uncharged and non-\nmagnetic bodies in mechanics. At the microscopic\nlevel, all bodies are made of charged constituents\n(nuclei and electrons) and the various contact\nforces arising due to elasticity of bodies, molecular\ncollisions and impacts, etc. can ultimately be\ntraced to the electrical forces between the charged\nconstituents of different bodies. The detailed\nmicroscopic origin of these forces is, however,\ncomplex and not useful for handling problems in\nmechanics at the macroscopic scale.  This is why\nthey are treated as different types of forces with\ntheir characteristic properties determined\nempirically.\n\n5.9.1  Friction\n\nLet us return to the example of a body of mass m\nat rest on a horizontal table. The force of gravity\n(mg)  is cancelled by the normal reaction force\n(N) of the table. Now suppose a force F is applied\nhorizontally to the body.  We know from\nexperience that a small  applied force may not\nbe enough to move the body.  But if the applied\nforce F were the only external force on the body,\nit must move with acceleration F/m, however\nsmall. Clearly, the body remains at rest because\nsome other force comes into play in the\nhorizontal direction and opposes the applied\nforce F, resulting in zero net force on the body.\nThis force f\n\ns\n parallel to the surface of the body in\n\ncontact with the table is known as frictional\nforce, or simply friction (Fig. 5.10(a)).  The\nsubscript stands for static friction to distinguish\nit from kinetic friction f\n\nk\n that we consider later\n\n(Fig. 5.10(b)).  Note that  static friction does not\n\nFig. 5.10 Static and sliding friction: (a)  Impending\nmotion of the body is opposed by static\n\nfriction. When external force exceeds the\n\nmaximum limit of static friction, the body\n\nbegins to move.  (b) Once the body is in\n\nmotion, it is subject to sliding or kinetic friction\n\nwhich opposes relative motion between the\n\ntwo surfaces in contact. Kinetic friction is\n\nusually less than the maximum value of static\n\nexist by itself.  When there is no applied force,\nthere is no static friction. It comes into play the\nmoment there is an applied force. As the applied\nforce F increases, f\n\ns\n also increases, remaining\n\nequal and opposite to the applied force (up to a\ncertain limit), keeping the body at rest. Hence, it\nis called static friction.  Static friction opposes\nimpending motion. The term impending motion\nmeans motion that would take place (but does\nnot actually take place) under the applied force,\nif friction were absent.\n\nWe know from experience that as the applied\nforce exceeds a certain limit, the body begins to\nmove.  It is found experimentally that the limiting\n\nvalue of static friction ( )\nmaxs\n\nf  is independent of\n\nthe area of contact and varies with the normal\nforce(N)  approximately as :\n\n( )\nmax\n\ns sf N= µ (5.13)\n\nwhere µ\ns \n\nis a constant of proportionality\ndepending only on the nature of the surfaces in\ncontact. The constant µ\n\ns \n is called the coefficient\n\nof static friction.  The law of static friction may\nthus be written as\n\nf\ns\n  ≤  µ\n\ns \n N (5.14)\n\nIf the applied force F exceeds ( )\nmaxs\n\nf  the body\n\nbegins to slide on the surface. It is found\nexperimentally that when relative motion has\nstarted, the frictional force decreases from the\n\nstatic maximum value ( )\nmaxs\n\nf . Frictional force\n\nthat opposes relative motion between surfaces\nin contact is called kinetic or sliding friction and\nis denoted by f\n\nk \n.\n  \nKinetic friction, like static\n\nfriction, is found to be independent of the area\nof contact.  Further, it is nearly independent of\nthe velocity. It satisfies a law similar to that for\nstatic friction:\n\nk k\n=f Nµ (5.15)\n\nwhere µ\nk′\n the coefficient of kinetic friction,\n\ndepends only on the surfaces in contact. As\nmentioned above, experiments show that µ\n\nk\n is\n\nless than µ\ns\n. When relative motion has begun,\n\nthe acceleration of the body according to the\nsecond law is ( F – f\n\nk\n)/m.  For a body moving with\n\nconstant velocity, F = f\nk\n. If the applied force on\n\nthe body is removed, its acceleration is – f\nk \n/m\n\nand it eventually comes to a stop.\n       The laws of friction given above do not have\nthe status of fundamental laws like those for\ngravitational, electric and magnetic forces. They\nare empirical relations that are only\n\nfriction.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS102\n\n\uf074\n\n\uf074\n\napproximately true.  Yet they are very useful in\npractical calculations in mechanics.\n\nThus, when two bodies are in contact, each\nexperiences a contact force by the other. Friction,\nby definition, is the component of the contact force\nparallel to the surfaces in contact, which opposes\nimpending or actual relative motion between the\ntwo surfaces. Note that it is not motion, but\nrelative motion that the frictional force opposes.\nConsider a box lying in the compartment of a train\nthat is accelerating.  If the box is stationary\nrelative to the train, it is in fact accelerating along\nwith the train. What forces cause the acceleration\nof the box?  Clearly, the only conceivable force in\nthe horizontal direction is the force of friction. If\nthere were no friction, the floor of the train would\nslip by and the box would remain at its initial\nposition due to inertia (and hit the back side of\nthe train). This impending relative motion is\nopposed by the static friction f\n\ns\n. Static friction\n\nprovides the same acceleration to the box as that\nof the train, keeping it stationary relative to the\ntrain.\n\nExample 5.7 Determine the maximum\nacceleration of the train in which a box\nlying on its floor will remain stationary,\ngiven that the co-efficient of static friction\nbetween the box and the train’s floor is\n0.15.\n\nAnswer  Since the acceleration of the box is due\nto the static friction,\n\nma  =  f\ns\n ≤ µ\n\ns\n N  =  µ\n\ns\n  m g\n\ni.e.   a  ≤  µ\ns\n g\n\n∴ a\nmax\n\n =  µ\ns \ng  = 0.15  x 10 m s–2\n\n= 1.5  m s–2  \uf074\n\nExample 5.8  See Fig. 5.11. A mass of 4 kg\nrests on a horizontal plane. The plane is\ngradually inclined until at an angle θ  =  15°\nwith the horizontal, the mass just begins to\nslide. What is the coefficient of static friction\nbetween the block and the surface ?\n\nFig. 5.11\n\nAnswer  The forces acting on a block of mass m\nat rest on an inclined plane are (i) the weight\nmg acting vertically downwards (ii) the normal\nforce N of the plane on the block, and (iii) the\nstatic frictional force f\n\ns\n opposing the impending\n\nmotion. In equilibrium, the resultant of these\nforces must be zero.  Resolving the weight mg\nalong the two directions shown, we have\n\nm g sin θ  =  f\ns\n   ,     m g  cos θ    =  N\n\nAs θ  increases, the self-adjusting frictional force\nf\ns\n increases until at θ = θ\n\nmax\n,  f\n\ns\n achieves its\n\nmaximum value, ( )\nmaxs\n\nf = µ\ns\n N.\n\nTherefore,\n\ntan θ\nmax\n\n  =  µ\ns\n  or  θ\n\nmax\n  =  tan–1  µ\n\ns\n\nWhen  θ  becomes just a little more than  θ\nmax\n\n ,\nthere is a small net force on the block and it\nbegins to slide.  Note that  θ\n\nmax\n depends only on\n\nµ\ns\n and is  independent of the mass of the block.\n\nFor θ\nmax\n\n   =  15°,\nµ\n\ns\n      =  tan 15°\n\n =  0.27 \uf074\n\nExample 5.9  What is the acceleration of\nthe block  and  trolley system shown in a\nFig. 5.12(a), if the coefficient of kinetic friction\nbetween the trolley and the surface is 0.04?\nWhat is the tension in the string? (Take g =\n10 m s-2).  Neglect the mass of the string.\n\n(a)\n\n(b) (c)\n\nFig. 5.12\n\n\uf074\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nLAWS OF MOTION 103\n\nis the reason why discovery of the wheel has\nbeen a major milestone in human history.\n\nRolling friction again has a complex origin,\nthough somewhat different from that of static\nand sliding friction. During rolling, the surfaces\nin contact get momentarily deformed a little, and\nthis results in a finite area (not a point) of the\nbody being in contact with the surface.  The net\neffect is that the component of the contact force\nparallel to the surface opposes motion.\n\nWe often regard friction as something\nundesirable. In many situations, like in a\nmachine with different moving parts, friction\ndoes have a negative role. It opposes relative\nmotion and thereby dissipates power in the form\nof heat, etc. Lubricants are a way of reducing\nkinetic friction in a machine. Another way is to\nuse ball bearings between two moving parts of a\nmachine [Fig. 5.13(a)]. Since the rolling friction\nbetween ball bearings and the surfaces in\ncontact is very small, power dissipation is\nreduced. A thin cushion of air maintained\nbetween solid surfaces in relative motion is\nanother effective way of reducing friction (Fig.\n5.13(a)).\n\nIn many practical situations, however, friction\nis critically needed. Kinetic friction that\ndissipates power is nevertheless important for\nquickly stopping relative motion. It is made use\nof by brakes in machines and automobiles.\nSimilarly, static friction is important in daily\nlife.  We are able to walk because of friction.  It\nis impossible for a car to move on a very slippery\nroad. On an ordinary road, the friction between\nthe tyres and the road provides the necessary\nexternal force to accelerate the car.\n\nAnswer  As the string is inextensible, and the\npully is smooth, the 3 kg block and the 20 kg\ntrolley both have same magnitude of\nacceleration.  Applying second law to motion of\nthe block (Fig. 5.12(b)),\n\n30 – T  = 3a\nApply the second law to motion of the trolley (Fig.\n5.12(c)),\n\nT – f\nk\n  =  20 a.\n\nNow      f\nk\n\n= µ\nk\n N,\n\nHere        µ\nk\n\n= 0.04,\n     N   =  20 x 10\n\n= 200 N.\nThus the equation for the motion of the trolley is\n\nT – 0.04 x 200 = 20 a Or  T – 8 = 20a.\n\nThese equations give a = \n22\n\n23\n\n m s –2 = 0.96 m s-2\n\nand T  = 27.1 N.                                                 \uf074\n\nRolling friction\n\nA body like a ring or a sphere rolling without\nslipping over a horizontal plane will suffer no\nfriction, in principle. At every instant, there is\njust one point of contact between the body and\nthe plane and this point has no motion relative\nto the plane. In this ideal situation, kinetic or\nstatic friction is zero and the body should\ncontinue to roll with constant velocity.  We know,\nin practice, this will not happen and some\nresistance to motion (rolling friction) does occur,\ni.e. to keep the body rolling, some applied force\nis needed. For the same weight, rolling friction\nis much smaller (even by 2 or 3 orders of\nmagnitude) than static or sliding friction.  This\n\nFig. 5.13 Some ways of reducing friction.

This force\ndirected forwards the centre is called the\ncentripetal force. For a stone rotated in a circle\nby a string, the centripetal force is provided by\nthe tension in the string.  The centripetal force\nfor motion of a planet around the sun is the\n\nis the static friction that provides the centripetal\nacceleration. Static friction opposes the\nimpending motion of the car moving away from\nthe circle.

This\nby definition is the frictional force. Note that it\n\nMotion of a car on a banked road\n\nWe can reduce the contribution of friction to the\ncircular motion of the car if the road is banked\n(Fig. 5.14(b)). Since there is no acceleration along\nthe vertical direction, the net force along this\ndirection must be zero. Hence,\n\nN cos θ  = mg + f sin θ         (5.19a)\n\nThe centripetal force is provided by the horizontal\ncomponents of N and f.\n\nN sin θ  + f cos θ  = \n2\n\nmv\n\nR\n                (5.19b)\n\nBut f sNµ≤\n\nThus to obtain v\nmax \n\n we put\n\ns\nf Nµ= .\n\nThen Eqs.

The co-efficient of static friction\nbetween the tyres and the road is 0.1. Will\nthe cyclist slip while taking the turn?\n\nAnswer   On an unbanked road, frictional force\nalone can provide the centripetal force needed\nto keep the cyclist moving on a circular turn\nwithout  slipping. If the speed is too large, or if\nthe turn is too sharp (i.e. of too small a radius)\nor both, the frictional force is not sufficient to\nprovide the necessary centripetal force, and the\ncyclist slips. The condition for the cyclist not to\nslip is given by Eq. (5.18) :\n\nv2  ≤  µ\ns\n R g\n\nNow, R = 3 m,  g = 9.8 m s-2,  µ\ns\n = 0.1.  That is,\n\nµ\ns\n R g = 2.94 m2 s-2. v = 18  km/h = 5  m s-1; i.e.,\n\nv2 = 25  m2 s-2.  The condition is not obeyed.\nThe cyclist will slip while taking the circular\nturn. \uf074\n\nExample 5.11 A circular racetrack of\nradius 300 m is banked at an angle of 15°.\nIf the coefficient of friction between the\nwheels of a race-car and the road is 0.2,\nwhat is the (a) optimum speed of the race-\ncar to avoid wear and tear on its tyres, and\n(b) maximum permissible speed to avoid\nslipping ?\n\nAnswer  On a banked road, the horizontal\ncomponent of the normal force and the frictional\nforce contribute to provide centripetal force to\nkeep the car moving on a circular turn without\nslipping.  At the optimum speed, the normal\nreaction’s component is enough to provide the\nneeded centripetal force, and the frictional force\nis not needed.  The optimum speed v\n\no\n is given by\n\nEq.

A typical problem in\nmechanics usually does not merely involve a\nsingle body under the action of given forces.\nMore often, we will need to consider an assembly\nof different bodies exerting forces on each other.\nBesides, each body in the assembly experiences\nthe force of gravity.  When trying to solve a\nproblem of this type, it is useful to remember\nthe fact that we can choose any part of the\nassembly and apply the laws of motion to that\npart provided  we include all forces on the chosen\npart due to the  remaining parts of the assembly.\nWe may call the chosen part of the assembly as\nthe system and the remaining part of the\nassembly (plus any other agencies of forces) as\nthe environment. We have followed the same\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS106\n\n\uf074\n\nmethod in solved examples. To handle a typical\nproblem in mechanics systematically, one\nshould use the following steps :\n(i) Draw a diagram showing schematically the\n\nvarious parts of the assembly of bodies, the\nlinks, supports, etc.\n\n(ii) Choose a convenient part of the assembly\nas one system.\n\n(iii) Draw a separate diagram which shows this\nsystem and all the forces on the system by\nthe remaining part of the assembly.  Include\nalso the forces on the system by other\nagencies. Do not include the forces on the\nenvironment by the system.  A diagram of\nthis type is known as ‘a free-body diagram’.\n(Note this does not imply that the system\nunder consideration is without a net force).\n\n(iv) In a free-body diagram, include information\nabout forces (their magnitudes and\ndirections) that are either given or you are\nsure of (e.g., the direction of tension in a\nstring along its length).  The rest should be\ntreated as unknowns to be determined using\nlaws of motion.\n\n(v) If necessary, follow the same procedure for\nanother choice of the system.  In doing so,\nemploy Newton’s third law.  That is, if in the\nfree-body diagram of A, the force on A due to\nB is shown as F, then in the free-body\ndiagram of B, the force on B due to A should\nbe shown as –F.\n\nThe following example illustrates the above\nprocedure :\n\nExample 5.12 See Fig. 5.15. A wooden\nblock of mass 2 kg rests on a soft horizontal\nfloor.  When an iron cylinder of mass 25 kg\nis placed on top of the block, the floor yields\nsteadily and the block and the cylinder\ntogether go down with an acceleration of\n0.1 m s–2.  What is the action of the block\non the floor (a) before and (b) after the floor\nyields ? Take g = 10 m s–2. Identify the\naction-reaction pairs in the problem.\n\nAnswer\n\n(a) The block is at rest on the floor. Its free-body\ndiagram shows two forces on the block, the\nforce of gravitational attraction by the earth\nequal to 2 × 10 = 20 N; and the normal force\nR of the floor on the block. By the First Law,\n\nthe net force on the block must be zero i.e.,\nR = 20 N.  Using third law the action of the\nblock (i.e. the force exerted on the floor by\nthe block) is equal to 20 N and directed\nvertically downwards.\n\n(b) The system (block + cylinder) accelerates\ndownwards with 0.1 m s-2. The free-body\ndiagram of the system shows two forces on\nthe system : the force of gravity due to the\nearth (270 N); and the normal force R ′ by the\nfloor.  Note, the free-body diagram of the\nsystem does not show the internal forces\nbetween the block and the cylinder.  Applying\nthe second law to the system,\n\n270 – R′   =  27 × 0.1N\n                 ie. R′   =  267.3 N\n\nFig. 5.15\n\nBy the third law, the  action  of the system on\nthe floor is equal to 267.3 N vertically downward.\n\nAction-reaction pairs\n\nFor (a): (i) the force of gravity (20 N) on the block\nby the earth (say, action); the force of\ngravity on the earth by the block\n(reaction) equal to 20 N directed\nupwards (not shown in the figure).\n(ii) the force on the floor by the block\n(action); the force on the block by the\nfloor (reaction).\n\nFor (b): (i) the force of gravity (270 N) on the\nsystem by the earth (say, action); the\nforce of gravity on the earth by the\nsystem (reaction), equal to 270 N,\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nLAWS OF MOTION 107\n\ndirected upwards (not shown in the\nfigure).\n(ii) the force on the floor by the system\n(action); the force on the system by the\nfloor (reaction).  In addition, for (b), the\nforce on the block by the cylinder and\nthe force on the cylinder by the block\nalso constitute an action-reaction pair.\n\nThe important thing to remember is that an\naction-reaction pair consists of mutual forces\nwhich are always equal and opposite between\ntwo bodies.  Two forces on the same body which\nhappen to be equal and opposite can never\nconstitute an action-reaction pair. The force of\n\ngravity on the mass in (a) or (b) and the normal\nforce on the mass by the floor are not action-\nreaction pairs. These forces happen to be equal\nand opposite for (a) since the mass is at rest.\nThey are not so for case (b), as seen already.\nThe weight of the system is 270 N, while the\nnormal force R′ is 267.3 N. \uf074\n\nThe practice of drawing free-body diagrams is\nof great help in solving problems in mechanics.\nIt allows you to clearly define your system and\nconsider all forces on the system due to objects\nthat are not part of the system itself.  A number\nof exercises in this and subsequent chapters will\nhelp you cultivate this practice.\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. Aristotle’s view that a force is necessary to keep a body in uniform motion is wrong.  A\nforce is necessary in practice to counter the opposing force of friction.\n\n2. Galileo extrapolated simple observations on motion of bodies on inclined planes, and\narrived at the law of inertia.  Newton’s first law of motion is the same law rephrased\nthus: “Everybody continues to be in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line,\nunless compelled by some external force to act otherwise”.  In simple terms, the First Law\nis “If external force on a body is zero, its acceleration is zero”.\n\n3. Momentum (p ) of a body is the product of its mass (m) and velocity (v) :\np  =  m v\n\n4. Newton’s second law of motion :\nThe rate of change of momentum of a body is proportional to the applied force and takes\n\nplace in the direction in which the force acts.  Thus\n\nd\n\nd\nk k m \n\nt\n= =\n\np\nF a\n\nwhere F is the net external force on the body and a its acceleration. We set the constant\nof proportionality k = 1 in SI units.  Then\n\nd\n\nd\nm\n\nt\n= =\n\np\nF a\n\nThe SI unit of force is newton : 1 N = 1 kg m s-2.\n(a) The second law is consistent with the First Law (F = 0 implies a = 0)\n(b) It is a vector equation\n(c) It is applicable to a particle, and also to a body or a system of particles, provided  F\n\nis the total external force on the system and a  is the acceleration of the system as\na whole.\n\n(d) F at a point at a certain instant determines a at the same point at that instant.\nThat is the Second Law is a local law; a at an instant does not depend on the\nhistory of motion.\n\n5. Impulse is the product of force and time which equals change in momentum.\nThe notion of impulse is useful when a large force acts for a short time to produce a\nmeasurable change in momentum. Since the time of action of the force is very short,\none can assume that there is no appreciable change in the position of the body during\nthe action of the impulsive force.\n\n6. Newton’s third law of motion:\nTo every action, there is always an equal and opposite reaction\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS108\n\nIn simple terms, the law can be stated thus :\nForces in nature always occur between pairs of bodies.  Force on a body A by body\n\nB is equal and opposite to the force on the body B by A.\n\nAction and reaction forces are simultaneous forces.  There is no cause-effect\nrelation between action and reaction.  Any of the two mutual forces can be\ncalled action and the other reaction.  Action and reaction act on different\nbodies and so they cannot be cancelled out.  The internal action and reaction\nforces between different parts of a body do, however, sum to zero.\n\n7. Law of Conservation of Momentum\nThe total momentum of an isolated system of particles is conserved.  The law\nfollows from the second and third law of motion.\n\n8. Friction\nFrictional force opposes (impending or actual) relative motion between two\nsurfaces in contact.  It is the component of the contact force along the common\ntangent to the surface in contact.  Static friction f\n\ns\n opposes impending relative\n\nmotion; kinetic friction f\nk\n opposes actual relative motion. They are independent\n\nof the area of contact and satisfy the following approximate laws :\n\n( )\nmax\n\nf f Rs s s≤ = µ\n\nk\nf R\n\nk\n= µ\n\nµ\ns\n (co-efficient of static friction) and µ\n\nk\n (co-efficient of kinetic friction) are\n\nconstants characteristic of the pair of surfaces in contact.  It is found\nexperimentally that µ\n\nk \nis less than µ\n\ns \n.\n\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n\n1. Force is not always in the direction of motion.  Depending on the situation, F\nmay be along v, opposite to v, normal to v or may make some other angle with\nv.  In every case, it is parallel to acceleration.\n\n2. If v = 0 at an instant, i.e. if a body is momentarily at rest, it does not mean that\nforce or acceleration are necessarily zero at that instant.  For example, when a\nball thrown upward reaches its maximum height, v = 0 but the force continues\nto be its weight mg and the acceleration is not zero but g.\n\n3. Force on a body at a given time is determined by the situation at the location of\nthe body at that time.  Force is not ‘carried’ by the body from its earlier history of\nmotion.  The moment after a stone is released out of an accelerated train, there is\nno horizontal force (or acceleration) on the stone, if the effects of the surrounding\nair are neglected.  The stone then has only the vertical force of gravity.\n\n4. In the second law of motion F = m a, F stands for the net force due to all\nmaterial agencies external to the body.  a is the effect of the force.  ma should\nnot be regarded as yet another force, besides F.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nLAWS OF MOTION 109\n\n5. The centripetal force should not be regarded as yet another kind of force. It is\nsimply a name given to the force that provides inward radial acceleration to a\nbody in circular motion. We should always look for some material force like\ntension, gravitational force, electrical force, friction, etc as the centripetal force\nin any circular motion.\n\n6. Static friction is a self-adjusting force up to its limit µ\ns\n N (f\n\ns \n≤ µ\n\ns\n N).  Do not put\n\nf\ns\n= µ\n\ns \nN\n\n \n without being sure that the maximum value of static friction is coming\n\ninto play.\n7. The familiar equation mg = R for a body on a table is true only if the body is in\n\nequilibrium.  The two forces mg and R can be different (e.g. a body in an\naccelerated lift). The equality of mg and R has no connection with the third\nlaw.\n\n8. The terms ‘action’ and ‘reaction’ in the third Law of Motion simply stand for\nsimultaneous mutual forces between a pair of bodies. Unlike their meaning in\nordinary language, action does not precede or cause reaction.  Action and reaction\nact on different bodies.\n\n9. The different terms like ‘friction’, ‘normal reaction’ ‘tension’, ‘air resistance’,\n‘viscous drag’, ‘thrust’, ‘buoyancy’, ‘weight’, ‘centripetal force’ all stand for ‘force’\nin different contexts.  For clarity, every force and its equivalent terms\nencountered in mechanics should be reduced to the phrase ‘force on A by B’.\n\n10. For applying the second law of motion, there is no conceptual distinction between\ninanimate and animate objects.  An animate object such as a human also\nrequires an external  force to accelerate.  For example, without the external\nforce of friction, we cannot walk on the ground.\n\n11. The objective concept of force in physics should not be confused with the\nsubjective concept of the ‘feeling of force’.  On a merry-go-around, all parts of\nour body are subject to an  inward force,  but we have a feeling of being pushed\noutward – the direction of impending motion.\n\nEXERCISES\n\n(For simplicity in numerical calculations, take g = 10 m s-2)\n5.1 Give the magnitude and direction of the net force acting on\n\n(a) a drop of rain falling down with a constant speed,\n(b) a cork of mass 10 g floating  on water,\n(c) a kite skillfully held stationary in the sky,\n(d) a car moving with a constant velocity of 30 km/h on a rough road,\n(e) a high-speed electron in space far from all material objects, and free of\n\nelectric and magnetic fields.\n\n5.2 A  pebble of mass 0.05 kg is thrown vertically upwards.

A farmer ploughing the field, a\nconstruction worker carrying bricks, a student studying for\na competitive examination, an artist painting a beautiful\nlandscape, all are said to be working. In physics, however,\nthe word ‘Work’ covers a definite and precise meaning.\nSomebody who has the capacity to work for 14-16 hours a\nday is said to have a large stamina or energy. We admire a\nlong distance runner for her stamina or energy. Energy is\nthus our capacity to do work. In Physics too, the term ‘energy’\nis related to work in this sense, but as said above the term\n‘work’ itself is defined much more precisely. The word ‘power’\nis used in everyday life with different shades of meaning. In\nkarate or boxing we talk of ‘powerful’ punches. These are\ndelivered at a great speed. This shade of meaning is close to\nthe meaning of the word ‘power’ used in physics. We shall\nfind that there is at best a loose correlation between the\nphysical definitions and the physiological pictures these\nterms generate in our minds. The aim of this chapter is to\ndevelop an understanding of these three physical quantities.\nBefore we proceed to this task, we need to develop a\nmathematical prerequisite, namely the scalar product of two\nvectors.\n\n6.1.1 The Scalar Product\n\nWe have learnt about vectors and their use in Chapter 4.\nPhysical quantities like displacement, velocity, acceleration,\nforce etc. are vectors. We have also learnt how vectors are\nadded or subtracted. We now need to know how vectors are\nmultiplied. There are two ways of multiplying vectors which\nwe shall come across : one way known as the scalar product\ngives a scalar from two vectors and the other known as the\nvector product produces a new vector from two vectors. We\nshall look at the vector product in Chapter 7. Here we take\nup the scalar product of two vectors. The scalar product or\ndot product of any two vectors A and B, denoted as A.B (read\n\n6.1 Introduction\n\n6.2 Notions of work and kinetic\nenergy : The work-energy\ntheorem\n\n6.3 Work\n\n6.4 Kinetic energy\n\n6.5 Work done by a variable\nforce\n\n6.6 The work-energy theorem for\na variable force\n\n6.7 The concept of potential\nenergy\n\n6.8 The conservation of\nmechanical energy\n\n6.9 The potential energy of a\nspring\n\n6.10 Various forms of energy : the\nlaw of conservation of energy\n\n6.11 Power\n\n6.12 Collisions\n\nSummary\n\nPoints to ponder\n\nExercises\n\nAdditional exercises\n\nAppendix 6.1\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nA dot B) is defined as\n\nA.B = A B cos θ (6.1a)\n\nwhere θ  is the angle between the two vectors as\nshown in Fig. 6.1(a). Since A, B and cos θ are\nscalars, the dot product of A and B is a scalar\nquantity. Each vector, A and B, has a direction\nbut their scalar product does not have a\ndirection.\n\nFrom Eq. (6.1a), we have\n\nA.B  = A (B cos θ )\n\n       = B (A cos θ )\n\nGeometrically, B cos θ is the projection of B onto\nA in Fig.6.1 (b) and A cos θ  is the projection of A\nonto B in Fig. 6.1 (c). So, A.B is the product of\nthe magnitude of A and the component of B along\nA. Alternatively, it is the product of the\nmagnitude of B and the component of A along B.\n\nEquation (6.1a) shows that the scalar product\nfollows the commutative law :\n\nA.B = B.A\n\nScalar product obeys the distributive\nlaw:\n\nA. (B + C) = A.B + A.C\n\nFurther, A.

Consider a\nconstant force F acting on an object of mass m.\nThe object undergoes a displacement d in the\npositive x-direction as shown in Fig. 6.2.\n\nFig. 6.2 An object undergoes a displacement d\n\nunder the influence of the force F.\n\n6.2 NOTIONS OF WORK AND KINETIC\nENERGY: THE WORK-ENERGY THEOREM\n\nThe following relation for rectilinear motion under\nconstant acceleration a has been encountered\nin Chapter 3,\n\n      v2 − u2 = 2 as (6.2)\n\nwhere u and v  are the initial and final speeds\nand s the distance traversed.  Multiplying both\nsides by m/2, we have\n\n2 21 1\n\n2 2\nmv mu mas Fs− = = (6.2a)\n\nwhere the last step follows from Newton’s Second\nLaw. We can generalise Eq. (6.2) to three\ndimensions by employing vectors\n\nv2 − u2 = 2 a.d\n\nHere a and d are acceleration and displacement\nvectors of the object respectively.\nOnce again multiplying both sides by m/2 , we obtain\n\n2 21 1\n\n2 2\nmv mu m − = =a.d F.d (6.2b)\n\nThe above equation provides a motivation for\nthe definitions of work and kinetic energy. The\nleft side of the equation is the difference in the\nquantity ‘half the mass times the square of the\nspeed’ from its initial value to its final value. We\ncall each of these quantities the ‘kinetic energy’,\ndenoted by K. The right side is a product of the\ndisplacement and the component of the force\nalong the displacement.  This quantity is called\n‘work’ and is denoted by W.  Eq. (6.2b) is then\n\nK\nf \n−  K\n\ni \n= W (6.3)\n\nwhere K\ni\n  and K\n\nf\n  are respectively the initial and\n\nfinal kinetic energies of the object. Work refers\nto the force and the displacement over which it\nacts. Work is done by a force on the body over\na certain displacement.\n\nEquation (6.2) is also a special case of the\nwork-energy (WE) theorem : The change in\nkinetic energy of a particle is equal to the\nwork done on it by the net force. We shall\ngeneralise the above derivation to a varying force\nin a later section.\n\nExample 6.2  It is well known that a\nraindrop falls under the influence of the\ndownward gravitational force and the\nopposing resistive force.

(a) How\nmuch work does the road do on the cycle ?\n(b) How much work does the cycle do on\nthe road ?\n\nAnswer  Work done on the cycle by the road is\n\nthe work done by the stopping (frictional) force\n\non the cycle due to the road.\n\n(a) The stopping force and the displacement make\n\nan angle of 180o  (π rad) with each other.\nThus, work done by the road,\n\nW\nr\n =  Fd cosθ\n\n     =  200 × 10 × cos π\n\n      = – 2000 J\nIt is this negative work that brings the cycle\n\nto a halt in accordance with WE theorem.\n\n(b) From Newton’s Third Law an equal and\n\nopposite force acts on the road due to the\n\ncycle. Its magnitude is 200 N. However, the\n\nroad undergoes no displacement.  Thus,\n\nwork done by cycle on the road is zero.            \uf074\n\nThe lesson of Example 6.3 is that though the\n\nforce on a body A exerted by the body B is always\n\nequal and opposite to that on B by A (Newton’s\n\nThird Law); the work done on A by B is not\n\nnecessarily equal and opposite to the work done\n\non B by A.\n\n6.4  KINETIC ENERGY\n\nAs noted earlier, if an object of mass m has\n\nvelocity v, its kinetic energy K  is\n\n2\nK m mv\n\n1 1\n= =\n\n2 2\nv v.                        (6.5)\n\nKinetic energy is a scalar quantity. The kinetic\n\nenergy of an object is a measure of the work an\n\nThe work done by the force is defined to be\n\nthe product of component of the force in the\n\ndirection of the displacement and the\n\nmagnitude of this displacement.  Thus\n\nW = (F cos θ )d = F.d (6.4)\n\nWe see that if there is no displacement, there\n\nis no work done even if the force is large.  Thus,\n\nwhen you push hard against a rigid brick wall,\n\nthe force you exert on the wall does no work.  Yet\n\nyour muscles are alternatively contracting and\n\nrelaxing and internal energy is being used up\n\nand you do get tired.  Thus, the meaning of work\n\nin physics is different from its usage in everyday\n\nlanguage.\n\nNo work is done if :\n\n(i) the displacement is zero as seen in the\n\nexample above. A weightlifter holding a 150\n\nkg mass steadily on his shoulder for 30 s\n\ndoes no work on the load during this time.\n\n(ii) the force is zero.  A block moving on a smooth\n\nhorizontal table is not acted upon by a\n\nhorizontal force (since there is no friction), but\n\nmay undergo a large displacement.\n\n(iii) the force and displacement are mutually\n\nperpendicular. This is so since, for θ = π/2 rad\n(= 90o), cos (π/2) = 0.  For the block moving on\na smooth horizontal table, the gravitational\n\nforce mg  does no work since it acts at right\n\nangles to the displacement. If we assume that\n\nthe moon’s orbits around the earth is\n\nperfectly circular then the earth’s\n\ngravitational force does no work.  The moon’s\n\ninstantaneous displacement is tangential\n\nwhile the earth’s force is radially inwards and\n\nθ  = π/2.\nWork can be both positive and negative.  If θ  is\n\nbetween 0o and 90o, cos θ  in Eq. (6.4) is positive.\nIf  θ  is  between 90o and 180o,   cos θ  is negative.\nIn many examples the frictional force opposes\n\ndisplacement and θ  = 180o. Then the work done\nby friction is negative (cos 180o = –1).\n\nFrom Eq. (6.4) it is clear that  work and energy\n\nhave the same dimensions,  [ML2T–2]. The SI unit\n\nof these is joule (J), named after the famous British\n\nphysicist James Prescott Joule  (1811-1869). Since\n\nwork and energy are so widely used as physical\n\nconcepts, alternative units abound and some of\n\nthese are listed in Table 6.1.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS118\n\n\uf074\n\nobject can do by the virtue of its motion. This\n\nnotion has been intuitively known for a long time.\n\nThe kinetic energy of a fast flowing stream\n\nhas been used to grind corn. Sailing\n\nships employ the kinetic energy of the wind. Table\n\n6.2 lists the kinetic energies for various\n\nobjects.\n\nExample 6.4  In a ballistics demonstration\na police officer fires a bullet of mass 50.0 g\nwith speed 200 m s-1 (see Table 6.2) on soft\nplywood of thickness 2.00 cm.  The bullet\nemerges with only 10% of its initial kinetic\nenergy.  What is the emergent speed of the\nbullet ?\n\nAnswer  The initial kinetic energy of the bullet\nis mv2/2 = 1000 J.  It has a final kinetic energy\nof 0.1×1000 = 100 J.

It is the variable force,\nwhich is more commonly encountered.  Fig. 6.3\nis a plot of a varying force in one dimension.\n\nIf the displacement ∆x is small, we can take\nthe force F (x)  as approximately constant and\nthe work done is then\n\n∆W =F (x) ∆x\n\nTable 6.2  Typical kinetic energies (K)\n\nThis is illustrated in Fig. 6.3(a).  Adding\nsuccessive rectangular areas in Fig. 6.3(a) we\nget the total work done as\n\n( )\uf001 ∆≅\nf\n\ni\n\nx\n\nx\n\nxxFW (6.6)\n\nwhere the summation is from the initial position\nx\n\ni\n \n \nto the final position x\n\nf\n.\n\nIf the displacements are allowed to approach\nzero, then the number of terms in the sum\nincreases without limit, but the sum approaches\na definite value equal to the area under the curve\nin Fig. 6.3(b). Then the work done is\n\n          = ( )∫ F x x\nx\n\nx\n\ni\n\nf\n\nd (6.7)\n\nwhere ‘lim’ stands for the limit of the sum when\n∆x  tends to zero.  Thus, for a varying force\nthe work done can be expressed as a definite\nintegral of force over displacement (see also\nAppendix 3.1).\n\nlimW =\nlim\n\nx∆ →\n( )\uf001 ∆\n\nf\n\ni\n\nx\n\nx\n\nxxF\n0\n\nFig. 6.3(a)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nWORK, ENERGY AND POWER 119\n\n\uf074\n\nFig. 6.3 (a) The shaded rectangle represents the\nwork done by the varying force F(x), over\nthe small displacement ∆x,  ∆W = F(x) ∆x.\n(b) adding the areas of all the rectangles we\n\nfind that for ∆x → 0, the area under the curve\nis exactly equal to the work done by F(x).\n\nExample 6.5  A woman pushes a trunk on\na railway platform which has a rough\nsurface.  She applies a force of 100 N over a\ndistance of 10 m.  Thereafter, she gets\nprogressively tired and her applied force\nreduces linearly with distance to 50 N.  The\ntotal distance through which the trunk has\nbeen moved is 20 m.  Plot the force applied\nby the woman and the frictional force, which\nis 50 N versus displacement.

We confine\nourselves to one dimension. The time rate of\nchange of kinetic energy is\n\nd\n\nd\n\nd\n\nd\n\nK\n\nt t\nm v=\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n1\n\n2\n2\n\n      \nd\n\nd\n\nv\nm v\n\nt\n=\n\n      v F=  (from Newton’s Second Law)\n\n      \nd\n\nd\n\nx\nF\n\nt\n=\n\nThus\n             dK = Fdx\nIntegrating from the initial position  (x \n\ni\n ) to final\n\nposition ( x \nf\n ), we have\n\nd dK F x\nK\n\nK\n\nx\n\nx\n\ni\n\nf\n\ni\n\nf\n\n∫ ∫=\n\nwhere,  K\ni\n  and K \n\nf\n  are the initial and final kinetic\n\nenergies corresponding to x\n i \n and\n\n \n x \n\nf\n.\n\nor K K F xf i\nx\n\nx\n\ni\n\nf\n\n− = ∫ d  (6.8a)\n\nFrom Eq. (6.7), it follows that\n\n           K\nf\n −  K\n\ni  \n= W (6.8b)\n\nThus, the WE theorem is proved for a variable\n\nforce.\n\nWhile the WE theorem is useful in a variety of\n\nproblems, it does not, in general, incorporate the\n\ncomplete dynamical information of Newton’s\n\nsecond law. It is an integral form of Newton’s\n\nsecond law. Newton’s second law is a relation\n\nbetween acceleration and force at any instant of\n\ntime. Work-energy theorem involves an integral\n\nover an interval of time. In this sense, the temporal\n\n(time) information contained in the statement of\n\nNewton’s second law is ‘integrated over’ and is\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS120\n\n\uf074\n\nnot available explicitly. Another observation is that\nNewton’s second law for two or three dimensions\nis in vector form whereas the work-energy\ntheorem is in scalar form. In the scalar form,\ninformation with respect to directions contained\nin Newton’s second law is not present.\n\nExample 6.6  A block of mass m  = 1 kg,\nmoving on a horizontal surface with speed\nv\n\ni\n = 2 m s–1 enters a rough patch ranging\n\nfrom x = 0.10 m to x = 2.01 m.

The term potential energy\nbrings to one’s mind ‘stored’ energy. A stretched\nbow-string possesses potential energy. When it\nis released, the arrow flies off at a great speed.\nThe earth’s crust is not uniform, but has\ndiscontinuities and dislocations that are called\nfault lines. These fault lines in the earth’s crust\n\nare like ‘compressed springs’. They possess a\nlarge amount of potential energy. An earthquake\nresults when these fault lines readjust. Thus,\npotential energy is the ‘stored energy’ by virtue\nof the position or configuration of a body. The\nbody left to itself releases this stored energy in\nthe form of kinetic energy. Let us make our notion\nof potential energy more concrete.\n\nThe gravitational force on a ball of mass m is\nmg . g may be treated as a constant near the earth\nsurface. By ‘near’ we imply that the height h  of\nthe ball above the earth’s surface is very small\ncompared to the earth’s radius R\n\nE \n(h <<R\n\nE\n) so that\n\nwe can ignore the variation of g near the earth’s\n\nsurface*. In what follows we have taken the\nupward direction to be positive. Let us raise the\nball up to a height h. The work done by the external\nagency against the gravitational force is mgh. This\nwork gets stored as potential energy.\nGravitational potential energy of an object, as a\nfunction of the height h, is denoted by V(h) and it\nis the negative of work done by the gravitational\nforce in raising the object to that height.\n\nV (h) = mgh\nIf h is taken as a variable, it is easily seen that\nthe gravitational force F equals the negative of\nthe derivative of V(h) with respect to h. Thus,\n\nd\n\nd\nF V(h) m g\n\nh\n= − = −\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the\ngravitational force is downward. When released,\nthe ball comes down with an increasing speed.\nJust before it hits the ground, its speed is given\nby the kinematic relation,\n\nv2 = 2gh\nThis equation can be written as\n\n2\n\n1\nm v2 = m g h\n\nwhich shows that the gravitational potential\nenergy of the object at height h, when the object\nis released, manifests itself as kinetic energy of\nthe object on reaching the ground.\n\nPhysically, the notion of potential energy is\napplicable only to the class of forces where work\ndone against the force gets ‘stored up’ as energy.\nWhen external constraints are removed, it\nmanifests itself as kinetic energy. Mathematically,\n(for simplicity, in one dimension) the potential\n\n* The variation of g with height is discussed in Chapter 8 on Gravitation.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nWORK, ENERGY AND POWER 121\n\nenergy V(x) is defined if the force F(x) can be\nwritten as\n\n( )\nd\n\nd\n\nV\nF x\n\nx\n= −\n\nThis implies that\n\nF(x) x V V V\nx\n\nx\n\ni f\n\nV\n\nV\n\ni\n\nf\n\ni\n\nf\n\nd d∫ ∫= − = −\n\nThe work done by a conservative force such as\n\ngravity depends on the initial and final positions\n\nonly. In the previous chapter we have worked\n\non examples dealing with inclined planes. If an\n\nobject of mass m is released from rest, from the\n\ntop of a smooth (frictionless) inclined plane of\n\nheight h, its speed at the bottom\n\nis gh2 irrespective of the angle of inclination.\n\nThus, at the bottom of the inclined plane it\n\nacquires a kinetic energy, mgh. If the work done\n\nor the kinetic energy did depend on other factors\n\nsuch as the velocity or the particular path taken\n\nby the object, the force would be called non-\n\nconservative.\nThe  dimensions  of  potential  energy are\n\n[ML2T –2] and the unit is joule (J), the same as\nkinetic energy or work. To reiterate, the change\nin potential energy, for a conservative force,\n∆V  is equal to the negative of the work done by\nthe force\n\n∆V = − F(x) ∆x (6.9)\nIn the example of the falling ball considered in\n\nthis section we saw how potential energy was\n\nconverted to kinetic energy. This hints at an\n\nimportant principle of conservation in mechanics,\n\nwhich we now proceed to examine.\n\n6.8 THE CONSERVATION OF MECHANICAL\nENERGY\n\nFor simplicity we demonstrate this important\n\nprinciple for one-dimensional motion. Suppose\n\nthat a body undergoes displacement ∆x under\nthe action of a conservative force F. Then from\n\nthe WE theorem we have,\n\n∆K =  F(x) ∆x\nIf the force is conservative, the potential energy\nfunction V(x) can be defined such that\n\n− ∆V  =  F(x) ∆x\nThe above equations imply that\n\n∆K + ∆V = 0\n∆(K + V ) = 0 (6.10)\n\nwhich means that K + V, the sum of the kinetic\n\nand potential energies of the body is a constant.\n\nOver the whole path, x\ni \nto x\n\nf\n, this means that\n\nK\ni\n + V(x\n\ni\n) = K\n\nf\n  + V(x\n\nf\n) (6.11)\n\nThe quantity K +V(x), is called the total\n\nmechanical energy of the system.  Individually\n\nthe kinetic energy K  and the potential energy\n\nV(x) may vary from point to point,  but the sum\n\nis a constant. The aptness of the term\n\n‘conservative force’ is now clear.\n\nLet us consider some of  the definitions of a\n\nconservative force.\n\n\uf06c A force F(x) is conservative if it can be derived\n\nfrom a scalar quantity V(x) by the relation\ngiven by Eq. (6.9). The three-dimensional\ngeneralisation requires the use of a vector\nderivative, which is outside the scope of this\nbook.\n\n\uf06c The work done by the conservative force\ndepends only on the end points. This can be\nseen from the relation,\n\nW = K\nf\n – K\n\ni\n = V (x\n\ni\n) – V(x\n\nf\n)\n\nwhich depends on the end points.\n\uf06c A third definition states that the work done\n\nby this force in a closed path is zero.  This is\nonce  again apparent from Eq. (6.11) since\nx\n\ni\n  = x\n\nf .\n\nThus, the principle of conservation of total\nmechanical energy can be stated as\n\nThe total mechanical energy of a system is\nconserved if the forces, doing work on it, are\nconservative.\n\nThe above discussion can be made more\nconcrete by considering the example of the\ngravitational force once again and that of the\nspring force in the next section. Fig. 6.5 depicts\na ball of mass m being dropped from a cliff of\nheight H.\n\nFig. 6.5 The conversion of potential energy to kinetic\nenergy for a ball of mass m dropped from a\n\nheight H.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS122\n\n\uf074\n\nThe total mechanical energies E\n0\n, E\n\nh\n, and E\n\nH\n\nof the ball at the indicated heights zero (ground\nlevel), h and H, are\n\nE\nH\n   = mgH                           (6.11 a)\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\nh hE mgh mv= + (6.11 b)\n\nE\n0     \n\n= (1/2) mv\nf\n2 (6.11 c)\n\nThe constant force is a special case of a spatially\ndependent force F(x). Hence, the mechanical\nenergy is conserved.

This illustrates\nthe conservation of mechanical energy.\n\nExample 6.7  A bob of mass m is suspended\nby a light string of length L .  It is imparted a\nhorizontal velocity v\n\no\n at the lowest point A\n\nsuch that it completes a semi-circular\ntrajectory in the vertical plane with the string\nbecoming slack only on reaching the topmost\npoint, C.  This is shown in Fig. 6.6. Obtain an\nexpression for (i) v\n\no\n; (ii)  the speeds at points\n\nB and C; (iii) the ratio  of  the kinetic energies\n(K\n\nB\n/K\n\nC\n) at B and C. Comment on the nature\n\nof the trajectory of the bob after it reaches\nthe point C.\n\nFig. 6.6\n\nAnswer  (i)  There are two external forces on\nthe bob : gravity and the tension (T ) in the\n\nstring. The latter does no work since the\n\ndisplacement of the bob is always normal to the\n\nstring. The potential energy of the bob is thus\n\nassociated with the gravitational force only. The\n\ntotal mechanical energy E  of the system is\n\nconserved.  We take the potential energy of the\n\nsystem to be zero at the lowest point A.

Fig. 6.7 shows a block\nattached to a spring and resting on a smooth\nhorizontal surface.  The other end of the spring\nis attached to a rigid wall. The spring is light\nand may be treated as massless.  In an ideal\nspring, the spring force F\n\ns\n  is proportional to\n\nx where x  is the displacement of the block from\nthe equilibrium position. The displacement could\nbe either positive [Fig. 6.7(b)] or negative\n[Fig. 6.7(c)].  This force law for the spring is called\nHooke’s law and is mathematically stated as\n\nF\ns\n =  − kx\n\nThe constant k is called the spring constant.  Its\nunit is N m-1.  The spring is said to be stiff if k is\nlarge and soft if k is small.\n\nSuppose that we pull the block outwards as in\nFig. 6.7(b). If the extension is x\n\nm\n, the work done by\n\nthe spring force is\n\nW F  xs s\n0\n\nxm\n\n= ∫ d     = − ∫ kx x\n0\n\nxm\n\nd\n\n2\n\n2\nmx k−=          (6.15)\n\nThis expression may also be obtained by\nconsidering the area of the triangle as in\nFig. 6.7(d).

We have explicitly demonstrated\nthat the spring force (i) is position dependent\nonly as first stated by Hooke, (F\n\ns\n = − kx); (ii)\n\ndoes work which only depends on the initial and\nfinal positions, e.g. Eq. (6.17).  Thus, the spring\nforce is a conservative force.\n\nWe define the potential energy V(x) of the spring\nto be zero when block and spring system is in the\nequilibrium position.  For an extension (or\ncompression) x  the above analysis suggests that\n\nV(x)\nkx\n\n2\n\n=\n2\n\n(6.19)\n\nYou may easily verify that − dV/dx = − k x, the\nspring force.

The\nkinetic energy gets converted to potential energy\n\nand vice versa, however, the total mechanical\nenergy remains constant. This is graphically\ndepicted in Fig. 6.8.\n\nExample 6.8  To simulate car accidents, auto\nmanufacturers study the collisions of moving\ncars with mounted springs of different spring\nconstants.  Consider a typical simulation with\na car of mass 1000 kg moving with a speed\n18.0 km/h on a smooth road and colliding\nwith a horizontally mounted spring of spring\nconstant 6.25 × 103 N m–1. What is the\nmaximum compression of the spring ?\n\nAnswer   At maximum compression the kinetic\nenergy of the car is converted entirely into the\npotential energy of the spring.\n\nThe kinetic energy of the moving car is\n\nK mv\n2=\n\n1\n\n2\n\n    \n5510\n\n2\n\n1 3 ×××=\n\n            K  = 1.25 × 104 J\n\nwhere we have converted 18 km h–1 to 5 m s–1  [It is\nuseful to remember that 36 km h–1 = 10 m s–1].\nAt maximum compression x\n\nm\n, the potential\n\nenergy V of the spring is equal to the kinetic\nenergy K of the moving car from the principle of\nconservation of mechanical energy.\n\n2\nmx k  V\n\n2\n\n1\n=\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nWORK, ENERGY AND POWER 125\n\n\uf074\n\n                = 1.25 × 104 J\nWe obtain\n\nx\nm\n = 2.00 m\n\nWe note that we have idealised the situation.\nThe spring is considered to be massless. The\nsurface has been considered to possess\nnegligible friction. \uf074\n\nWe conclude this section by making a few\nremarks on conservative forces.\n\n(i) Information on time is absent from the above\n\ndiscussions. In the example considered\n\nabove, we can calculate the compression, but\n\nnot the time over which the compression\n\noccurs.  A solution of Newton’s Second Law\n\nfor this system is required for temporal\n\ninformation.\n\n(ii) Not all forces are conservative. Friction, for\n\nexample, is a non-conservative force. The\n\nprinciple of conservation of energy will have\n\nto be modified in this case. This is illustrated\n\nin Example 6.9.\n\n(iii) The zero of the potential energy is arbitrary.\n\nIt is set according to convenience.  For the\n\nspring force we took V(x) = 0, at x = 0, i.e. the\n\nunstretched spring had zero potential\n\nenergy.  For the constant gravitational force\n\nmg, we took V = 0  on the earth’s surface.  In\n\na later chapter we shall see that for the force\n\ndue to the universal law of gravitation, the\n\nzero is best defined at an infinite distance\n\nfrom the gravitational source. However, once\n\nthe zero of the potential energy is fixed in a\n\ngiven discussion, it must be consistently\n\nadhered to throughout the discussion. You\n\ncannot change horses in midstream !\n\nExample 6.9   Consider Example 6.8 taking\nthe coefficient of friction, µ, to be 0.5 and\ncalculate the  maximum compression of the\nspring.\n\nAnswer  In presence of friction, both the spring\n\nforce and the frictional force act so as to oppose\n\nthe compression of the spring as shown in\n\nFig. 6.9.\n\nWe invoke the work-energy theorem, rather\n\nthan the conservation of mechanical energy.\n\nThe change in kinetic energy is\n\nFig. 6.9  The forces acting on the car.\n\n∆K  = K\nf\n − K\n\ni \n\n2\nv m   \n\n2\n\n1\n0 −=\n\nThe work done by the net force is\n\n1\n\n2\n2\nm mW   kx   m g x= − − \uf001\n\nEquating we have\n\n1 1\n\n2 2\n2 2\n\nm mm v   k x  m g x= + \uf001\n\nNow  µmg  = 0.5 × 103 × 10 = 5 × 103 N (taking\ng =10.0 m s-2). After rearranging the above\nequation we obtain the following quadratic\nequation in the unknown x\n\nm\n.\n\n2\n2 2\nm mk x m g x m v 0+ − =\uf001\n\nwhere we take the positive square root since\nx\n\nm\n is positive. Putting in numerical values we\n\nobtain\n\nx\nm\n  = 1.35 m\n\nwhich, as expected, is less than the result in\nExample 6.8.\n\nIf the two forces on the body consist of a\nconservative force F\n\nc\n and a non-conservative\n\nforce  F\nnc\n , the conservation of mechanical energy\n\nformula will have to be modified. By the WE\ntheorem\n\n(F\nc\n+ F\n\nnc\n) ∆x = ∆K\n\nBut     F\nc\n ∆x = − ∆V\n\nHence,             ∆(K + V) = F\nnc \n\n∆x\n                       ∆E    = F\n\nnc \n∆x\n\nwhere E  is the total mechanical energy. Over\nthe path this assumes the form\n\nE\nf\n −−−−− E\n\ni\n  = W\n\nnc\n\nwhere W\nnc\n\n  is the total work done by the\nnon-conservative forces over the path. Note that\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS126\n\nunlike the conservative force, W\nnc  \n\ndepends on\nthe particular path i  to  f. \uf074\n\n6.10 VARIOUS FORMS OF ENERGY : THE LAW\nOF CONSERVATION OF ENERGY\n\nIn the previous section we have discussed\nmechanical energy.  We have seen that it can be\nclassified into two distinct categories : one based\non motion, namely kinetic energy; the other on\nconfiguration (position), namely potential energy.\nEnergy comes in many a forms which transform\ninto one another in ways which may not often\nbe clear to us.\n\n6.10.1  Heat\n\nWe have seen that the frictional force is not a\nconservative force. However, work is associated\nwith the force of friction, Example 6.5. A block of\nmass m sliding on a rough horizontal surface\nwith speed v\n\n0\n comes to a halt over a distance x\n\n0\n.\n\nThe work done by the force of kinetic friction f\nover x\n\n0 \nis –f x\n\n0\n.\n \nBy the work-energy theorem\n\n2\no 0m v /2  f  x .=  If we confine our scope to\n\nmechanics, we would say that the kinetic energy\nof the block is ‘lost’ due to the frictional force.\nOn examination of the block and the table we\nwould detect a slight increase in their\ntemperatures. The work done by friction is not\n‘lost’, but is transferred as heat energy. This\nraises the internal energy of the block and the\ntable. In winter, in order to feel warm, we\ngenerate heat by vigorously rubbing our palms\ntogether. We shall see later that the internal\nenergy is associated with the ceaseless, often\nrandom, motion of molecules. A quantitative idea\nof the transfer of heat energy is obtained by\nnoting that 1 kg of water releases about 42000 J\nof energy when it cools by10 °C.\n\n6.10.2   Chemical Energy\n\nOne of the greatest technical achievements of\nhumankind occurred when we discovered how\nto ignite and control fire. We learnt to rub two\nflint stones together (mechanical energy), got\nthem to heat up and to ignite a heap of dry leaves\n(chemical energy), which then provided\nsustained warmth.  A matchstick ignites into a\nbright flame when struck against a specially\nprepared chemical surface. The lighted\nmatchstick, when applied to a firecracker,\nresults in a spectacular display of sound and\nlight.\n\nChemical energy arises from the fact that the\nmolecules participating in the chemical reaction\nhave different binding energies. A stable chemical\ncompound has less energy than the separated parts.\nA chemical reaction is basically a rearrangement\nof atoms. If the total energy of the reactants is more\nthan the products of the reaction, heat is released\nand the reaction is said to be an exothermic\nreaction. If the reverse is true, heat is absorbed and\nthe reaction is endothermic. Coal consists of\ncarbon and a kilogram of it when burnt releases\nabout 3 × 107 J of energy.\n\nChemical energy is associated with the forces\nthat give rise to the stability of substances. These\n\nforces bind atoms into molecules, molecules into\n\npolymeric chains, etc. The chemical energy\n\narising from the combustion of coal, cooking gas,\n\nwood and petroleum is indispensable to our daily\n\nexistence.\n\n6.10.3  Electrical Energy\n\nThe flow of electrical current causes bulbs to\n\nglow, fans to rotate and bells to ring.  There are\n\nlaws governing the attraction and repulsion of\n\ncharges and currents, which we shall learn\n\nlater. Energy is associated with an electric\n\ncurrent. An urban Indian  household consumes\n\nabout 200 J of energy per second on an average.\n\n6.10.4  The Equivalence of Mass and Energy\n\nTill the end of the nineteenth century, physicists\n\nbelieved that in every physical and chemical\n\nprocess, the mass of an isolated system is\n\nconserved. Matter might change its phase, e.g.\n\nglacial ice could melt into a gushing stream, but\n\nmatter is neither created nor destroyed; Albert\n\nEinstein (1879-1955) however, showed that mass\n\nand energy are equivalent and are related by\n\nthe relation\n\nE = m c2 (6.20)\nwhere c, the speed of light in vacuum is\napproximately 3 ×108 m s–1.  Thus, a staggering\namount of energy is associated with a mere\nkilogram of matter\n\nE = 1× (3 ×108)2 J = 9 ×1016 J.\nThis is equivalent to the annual electrical output\nof a large (3000 MW) power generating station.\n\n6.10.5  Nuclear Energy\n\nThe most destructive weapons made by man, the\nfission and fusion bombs are manifestations of\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nWORK, ENERGY AND POWER 127\n\nthe above equivalence of mass and energy [Eq.\n\n(6.20)]. On the other hand the explanation of the\n\nlife-nourishing energy output of the sun is also\n\nbased on the above equation.  In this case\n\neffectively four light hydrogen nuclei fuse to form\n\na helium nucleus whose mass is less than the\n\nsum of the masses of the reactants. This mass\n\ndifference, called the mass defect ∆m  is the\nsource of energy (∆m)c2.  In fission, a heavy\n\nnucleus like uranium U\n235\n92 \n\n, is split by a neutron\n\ninto lighter nuclei.  Once again the final mass is\n\nless than the initial mass and the mass difference\n\ntranslates into energy, which can be tapped to\n\nprovide electrical energy as in nuclear power\n\nplants (controlled nuclear fission) or can be\n\nemployed in making nuclear weapons\n\n(uncontrolled nuclear fission). Strictly, the energy\n\n∆E released in a chemical reaction can also be\nrelated to the mass defect ∆m = ∆E/c2. However,\nfor a chemical reaction, this mass defect is much\n\nsmaller than for a nuclear reaction. Table 6.3\n\nlists the total energies for a variety of events and\n\nphenomena.\n\nTable 6.3   Approximate energy associated with various phenomena\n\nExample 6.10  Examine Tables 6.1-6.3\nand express (a) The energy required to\nbreak one bond in DNA in eV; (b) The\nkinetic energy of an air molecule (10—21 J)\nin eV; (c) The daily intake of a human adult\nin kilocalories.\n\nAnswer  (a) Energy required to break one bond\nof DNA is\n\n \n\n20\n\n19\n\n10 J\n~ 0.06 eV\n\n1.6 10 J/eV\n\n−\n\n−×\n\nNote 0.1 eV = 100 meV (100 millielectron volt).\n\n(b) The kinetic energy of an air molecule is\n\n \n\n21\n\n19\n\n10 J\n~ 0.0062 eV\n\n1.6 10 J/eV\n\n−\n\n−×\n\nThis is the same as 6.2 meV.\n\n(c) The average human consumption in a day is\n\n7\n\n \n3\n\n10 J\n~ 2400 kcal\n\n4.2×10 J/kcal\n\n\uf074\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS128\n\nWe point out a common misconception created\n\nby newspapers and magazines. They mention\n\nfood values in calories and urge us to restrict\n\ndiet intake to below 2400 calories. What they\n\nshould be saying is kilocalories (kcal) and not\n\ncalories. A person consuming 2400 calories a\n\nday will soon starve to death! 1 food calorie is\n\n1 kcal. \uf074\n\n6.10.6 The Principle of Conservation of\nEnergy\n\nWe have seen that the total mechanical energy\n\nof the system is conserved if the forces doing work\n\non it are conservative. If some of the forces\n\ninvolved are non-conservative, part of the\n\nmechanical energy may get transformed into\n\nother forms such as heat, light and sound.\n\nHowever, the total energy of an isolated system\n\ndoes not change, as long as one accounts for all\n\nforms of energy.  Energy may be transformed from\n\none form to another but the total energy of an\n\nisolated system remains constant. Energy can\n\nneither be created, nor destroyed.\n\nSince the universe as a whole may be viewed\n\nas an isolated system, the total energy of the\n\nuniverse is constant. If one part of the universe\n\nloses energy, another part must gain an equal\n\namount of energy.\n\nThe principle of conservation of energy cannot\n\nbe proved. However, no violation of this principle\n\nhas been observed.  The concept of conservation\n\nand transformation of energy into various forms\n\nlinks together various branches of physics,\n\nchemistry and life sciences. It provides a\n\nunifying, enduring element in our scientific\n\npursuits. From engineering point of view all\n\nelectronic, communication and mechanical\n\ndevices rely on some forms of energy\n\ntransformation.\n\n6.11  POWER\n\nOften it is interesting to know not only the work\ndone on an object, but also the rate at which\nthis work is done. We say a person is physically\nfit if he not only climbs four floors of a building\nbut climbs them fast. Power is defined as the\ntime rate at which work is done or energy is\ntransferred.\n\nThe average power of a force is defined as the\nratio of the work, W, to the total time t taken\n\nP\nW\n\nt\nav\n\n=\n\nThe instantaneous power is defined as the\nlimiting value of the average power as time\ninterval approaches zero,\n\nd\n\nd\n\nW\nP\n\nt\n= (6.21)\n\nThe work dW done by a force F for a displacement\ndr is dW = F.dr.  The instantaneous power can\nalso be expressed as\n\nd\n\nd\nP\n\nt\n= F.\n\nr\n\n= F.v (6.22)\n\nwhere v is the instantaneous velocity when the\nforce is F.\n\nPower, like work and energy, is a scalar\nquantity.  Its dimensions are [ML2T–3]. In the SI,\nits unit is called a watt (W).  The watt is 1 J s–1.\nThe unit of power is named after James Watt,\none of the innovators of the steam engine in the\neighteenth century.\n\nThere is another unit of power, namely the\nhorse-power (hp)\n\n1 hp = 746 W\nThis unit is still used to describe the output of\nautomobiles, motorbikes, etc.\n\nWe encounter the unit watt when we buy\nelectrical goods such as bulbs, heaters and\nrefrigerators.  A 100 watt bulb which is on for 10\nhours uses 1 kilowatt hour (kWh) of energy.\n\n100 (watt) × 10 (hour)\n= 1000 watt hour\n=1 kilowatt hour (kWh)\n= 103 (W) × 3600 (s)\n= 3.6 × 106 J\n\nOur electricity bills carry the energy\nconsumption in units of kWh.  Note that kWh is\na unit of energy and not of power.\n\nExample 6.11  An elevator can carry a\nmaximum load of 1800 kg (elevator +\npassengers) is moving up with a constant\nspeed of 2 m s–1. The frictional force opposing\nthe motion is 4000 N. Determine the\nminimum power delivered by the motor to\nthe elevator in watts as well as in horse\npower.\n\n\uf075\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nWORK, ENERGY AND POWER 129\n\nAnswer  The downward force on the elevator is\n\nF = m g + F\nf\n = (1800 × 10) + 4000 = 22000 N\n\nThe motor must supply enough power to balance\nthis force.  Hence,\n\nP = F. v = 22000 × 2 = 44000 W = 59 hp        \uf020\uf074\n\n6.12  COLLISIONS\n\nIn physics we study motion (change in position).\nAt the same time, we try to discover physical\nquantities, which do not change in a physical\nprocess. The laws of momentum and energy\nconservation are typical examples. In this\nsection we shall apply these laws to a commonly\nencountered phenomena, namely collisions.\nSeveral games such as billiards, marbles or\ncarrom involve collisions.We shall study the\ncollision of two masses in an idealised form.\n\nConsider two masses m\n1\n and m\n\n2\n.  The particle\n\nm\n1\n is moving with speed v\n\n1i \n, the subscript ‘i’\n\nimplying initial. We can cosider m\n2\n  to be at rest.\n\nNo loss of generality is involved in making such\na selection. In this situation the  mass m\n\n1\n\ncollides  with  the stationary  mass m\n2\n  and  this\n\nis depicted in  Fig. 6.10.\n\nFig. 6.10 Collision of mass m\n1\n, with a stationary mass m\n\n2\n.\n\nThe masses m\n1\n and m\n\n2\n fly-off in different\n\ndirections.  We shall see that there are\nrelationships, which connect the masses, the\nvelocities and the angles.\n\n6.12.1  Elastic and  Inelastic Collisions\n\nIn all collisions the total linear momentum is\nconserved; the initial momentum of the system\nis equal to the final momentum of the system.\nOne can argue this as follows.  When two objects\ncollide, the mutual impulsive forces acting over\nthe collision time ∆t cause a change in their\nrespective momenta :\n\n∆p\n1 \n= F\n\n12  \n∆t\n\n∆p\n2 \n= F\n\n21  \n∆t\n\nwhere F\n12\n\n is  the force exerted on the first particle\n\nby the second particle. F\n21 \n\nis likewise the force\nexerted on the second particle by the first particle.\nNow from Newton’s third law, F\n\n12\n = − F\n\n21\n.  This\n\nimplies\n\n∆p\n1 \n+ ∆p\n\n2 \n=  0\n\nThe above conclusion is true even though the\nforces vary in a complex fashion during the\ncollision time ∆t. Since the third law is true at\nevery instant, the total impulse on the first object\nis equal and opposite to that on the second.\n\nOn the other hand, the total kinetic energy of\nthe system is not necessarily conserved. The\nimpact and deformation during collision may\ngenerate heat and sound. Part of the initial kinetic\nenergy is transformed into other forms of energy.\nA useful way to visualise the deformation during\ncollision is in terms of a ‘compressed spring’. If\nthe ‘spring’ connecting the two masses regains\nits original shape without loss in energy, then\nthe initial kinetic energy is equal to the final\nkinetic energy but the kinetic energy during the\ncollision time ∆t is not constant. Such a collision\nis called an elastic collision. On the other hand\nthe deformation may not be relieved and the two\nbodies could move together after the collision. A\ncollision in which the two particles move together\nafter the collision is called a completely inelastic\ncollision. The intermediate case where the\ndeformation is partly relieved and some of the\ninitial kinetic energy is lost is more common and\nis appropriately called an inelastic collision.\n\n6.12.2  Collisions in One Dimension\n\nConsider first a completely inelastic collision\nin one dimension.

Two, if two bodies\nof different sizes collide on a table, it would be difficult to arrange them for a head-on collision\nunless their centres of mass are at the same height above the surface. Three, it will be fairly\ndifficult to measure velocities of the two bodies just before and just after collision.\n\nBy performing this experiment in a vertical direction, all the three difficulties vanish. Take\ntwo balls, one of which is heavier (basketball/football/volleyball) and the other lighter (tennis\nball/rubber ball/table tennis ball). First take only the heavier ball and drop it vertically from\nsome height, say 1 m. Note to which it rises. This gives the velocities near the floor or ground,\n\njust before and just after the bounce (by using 2 2v gh= ). Hence you\n\nwill get the coefficient of restitution.\nNow take the big ball and a small ball and hold them in your\n\nhands one over the other, with the heavier ball below the lighter\none, as shown here. Drop them together, taking care that they remain\ntogether while falling, and see what happens. You will find that the\nheavier ball rises less than when it was dropped alone, while the\nlighter one shoots up to about 3 m. With practice, you will be able to\nhold the ball properly so that the lighter ball rises vertically up and\ndoes not fly sideways. This is head-on collision.\n\nYou can try to find the best combination of balls which gives you\nthe best effect. You can measure the masses on a standard balance.\nWe leave it to you to think how you can determine the initial and\nfinal velocities of the balls.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nWORK, ENERGY AND POWER 131\n\n\uf074\n\nto 103 m s–1 so that it can have a high\n\nprobability of interacting with isotope \n92\n\n235\nU\n\nand causing it to fission.

In practice,\n\nhowever, this number is smaller since head-on\ncollisions are rare. \uf074\n\nIf the initial velocities and final velocities of\nboth the bodies are along the same straight line,\nthen it is called a one-dimensional collision, or\nhead-on collision. In the case of small spherical\nbodies, this is possible if the direction of travel\nof body 1 passes through the centre of body 2\nwhich is at rest. In general, the collision is two-\ndimensional, where the initial velocities and the\nfinal velocities lie in a plane.\n\n6.12.3  Collisions in Two Dimensions\n\nFig. 6.10 also depicts the collision of a moving\n\nmass m\n1\n with the stationary mass m\n\n2\n. Linear\n\nmomentum is conserved in such a collision.\n\nSince momentum is a vector this implies three\n\nequations for the three directions {x, y, z}.\n\nConsider the plane determined by the final\n\nvelocity directions of m\n1 \nand m\n\n2 \nand choose it to\n\nbe the x-y plane. The conservation of the\n\nz-component of the linear momentum implies\n\nthat the entire collision is in the x-y plane. The\n\nx- and y-component equations are\n\nm\n1\nv\n\n1i\n = m\n\n1\nv\n\n1f\n cos θ \n\n1\n + m\n\n2\nv\n\n2f\n cos θ \n\n2\n     (6.29)\n\n0  = m\n1\nv\n\n1f\n  sin θ\n\n1\n −  m\n\n2\nv\n\n2f\n sin θ\n\n2\n        (6.30)\n\nOne knows {m\n1\n, m\n\n2\n, v\n\n1i\n} in most situations.  There\n\nare thus four unknowns {v\n1f\n\n, v\n2f\n\n, θ\n1 \nand θ\n\n2\n}, and\n\nonly two equations. If θ \n1 \n\n=\n \nθ \n\n2 \n= 0, we regain\n\nEq.

That still\nleaves us one equation short.  At least one of\nthe four unknowns, say θ \n\n1\n, must be made known\n\nfor the problem to be solvable. For example, θ\n1\n\ncan be determined by moving a detector in an\nangular fashion from the x  to the y  axis. Given\n{m\n\n1\n, m\n\n2\n, v\n\n1i\n, θ\n\n1\n} we can determine {v\n\n1f\n, v\n\n2f\n, θ\n\n2\n}\n\nfrom Eqs. (6.29)-(6.31).\n\nExample 6.13  Consider the collision\ndepicted in Fig. 6.10 to be between two\nbilliard balls with equal masses m\n\n1\n = m\n\n2\n.\n\nThe first  ball  is  called the cue while the\nsecond ball is called the target. The\nbilliard player wants to ‘sink’ the target\nball in a corner pocket, which is at an\nangle θ\n\n2\n = 37°. Assume that the collision\n\nis elastic and that friction and rotational\nmotion are not important.

(6.32) and (6.33), we get\n\ncos (θ\n1\n + 37°) = 0\n\nor θ\n1\n + 37° = 90°\n\nThus,    θ\n1\n = 53°\n\nThis proves the following result :  when two equal\nmasses undergo a glancing elastic collision with\none of them at rest, after the collision, they will\nmove at right angles to each other.               \uf020\uf074\n\nThe matter simplifies greatly if we consider\n\nspherical masses with smooth surfaces, and\n\nassume that collision takes place only when the\n\nbodies touch each other. This is what happens\n\nin the games of marbles, carrom and billiards.\n\nIn our everyday world, collisions take place only\n\nwhen two bodies touch each other. But consider\n\na comet coming from far distances to the sun, or\n\nalpha particle coming towards a nucleus and\n\ngoing away in some direction. Here we have to\n\ndeal with forces involving action at a distance.\n\nSuch an event is called scattering. The velocities\n\nand directions in which the two particles go away\n\ndepend on their initial velocities as well as the\n\ntype of interaction between them, their masses,\n\nshapes and sizes.\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. The work-energy theorem states  that  the change in kinetic energy of a body is the work\ndone by the net force on the body.\n\nK\nf\n - K\n\ni\n = W\n\nnet\n\n2. A  force is conservative if (i) work done by it on an object is path  independent and\ndepends only on the end points {x\n\ni\n, x\n\nj\n}, or (ii) the work done by the force is zero for an\n\narbitrary closed path taken by the object such that it returns to its initial position.\n3. For a conservative force in one dimension, we may define a potential energy function V(x)\n\nsuch that\n\nF x\nV x\n\nx\n( ) = −\n\n( )d\nd\n\nor V V = F x  xi f\nx\n\nx\n\ni\n\nf\n\n− ( )∫ d\n\n4. The principle of conservation of mechanical energy states that the total mechanical\nenergy of a body remains constant if the only forces that act on the body are conservative.\n\n5. The gravitational potential energy of a particle of mass m at a height x  about the earth’s\nsurface is\n\nV(x) = m g x\nwhere the variation of g with height is ignored.\n\n6. The elastic potential energy of a spring of force constant k  and extension x is\n\nV x    k x( ) =\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n7. The scalar or dot product of two vectors A and B is written as A.B  and is a scalar\nquantity given by : A.B = AB cos θ,  where θ  is the angle between A and B.  It can be\npositive, negative or zero depending upon the value of θ. The scalar product of two\nvectors can be interpreted as the product of magnitude of one vector and component\nof the other vector along the first vector. For unit vectors :\n\nˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆi i j j k k⋅ = ⋅ = ⋅ = 1 and ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆi j j k k i⋅ = ⋅ = ⋅ = 0\nScalar products obey the commutative and  the distributive laws.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nWORK, ENERGY AND POWER 133\n\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n\n1. The phrase ‘calculate the work done’ is incomplete. We should refer (or imply\nclearly by context) to the work done by a specific force or a group of forces on a\ngiven  body over a certain displacement.\n\n2. Work done is a scalar quantity. It can be positive or negative unlike mass and\nkinetic energy which are positive scalar quantities. The work done by the friction\nor viscous force on a moving body is negative.\n\n3. For two bodies, the sum of the mutual forces exerted between them is zero from\nNewton’s Third Law,\n\nF\n12  \n\n+  F\n21 \n\n =  0\n\nBut the sum of the work done by the two forces need not always cancel, i.e.\n\nW\n12  \n\n+ W\n21  \n\n≠  0\n\nHowever, it may sometimes be true.\n4. The work done by a force can be calculated sometimes even if the exact nature of\n\nthe force is not known. This is clear from Example 6.2 where the WE theorem is\nused in such a situation.\n\n5. The WE theorem is not independent of Newton’s Second Law. The WE theorem\nmay be viewed as a scalar form of the Second Law. The principle of conservation\nof mechanical energy may be viewed as a consequence of the  WE theorem for\nconservative forces.\n\n6. The WE theorem holds in all inertial frames. It can also be extended to non-\ninertial frames provided we include the pseudoforces in the calculation of the\nnet force acting on the body under consideration.\n\n7. The potential energy of a body subjected to a conservative force is always\nundetermined upto a constant. For example, the point where the potential\nenergy is zero is a matter of choice. For the gravitational  potential energy mgh,\nthe zero of the potential energy is chosen to be the ground. For the spring\npotential energy kx2/2 , the zero of the potential energy is the equilibrium position\nof the oscillating mass.\n\n8. Every force encountered in mechanics does not have an associated potential\nenergy. For example, work done by friction over a closed path is not zero and no\npotential energy can be associated with friction.\n\n9. During a collision : (a) the total linear momentum is conserved at each instant of\nthe collision ; (b) the kinetic energy conservation (even if the collision is  elastic)\napplies after the collision is over and does not hold at every instant of the collision.\nIn fact the two colliding objects are deformed and may be momentarily at rest\nwith respect to each other.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS134\n\nEXERCISES\n\n6.1 The sign of work done by a force on a body is important to understand.

A woman standing with a very heavy load on\nher head may get very tired.  But no mechanical work is involved.\nThat is not to say that mechanical work cannot be estimated in\nordinary human activity.\n\nConsider a person walking with constant speed v\n0\n. The mechanical work he does may be estimated simply\n\nwith the help of the work-energy theorem. Assume :\n(a) The major work done in walking is due to the acceleration and deceleration of the legs with each stride\n\n(See Fig. 6.20).\n(b) Neglect air resistance.\n(c) Neglect the small work done in lifting the legs against gravity.\n(d) Neglect the swinging of hands etc. as is common in walking.\n\nAs we can see in Fig. 6.20, in each stride the leg is brought from rest to a speed, approximately equal to the\nspeed of walking, and then brought to rest again.\n\nFig. 6.20 An illustration of a single stride in walking. While the first leg is maximally off the round, the second leg\nis on the ground and vice-versa\n\nThe work done by one leg in each stride is 2\n0l v m   by the work-energy theorem. Here ml  is the mass of the leg.\n\nNote 2/\n2\n0l v m  energy is expended by one set of leg muscles to bring the foot from rest to speed v0 while an\n\nadditional 2/\n2\n0l v m   is expended by a complementary set of leg muscles to bring the foot to rest from speed v0.\n\nHence work done by both legs in one stride is (study Fig. 6.20 carefully)\n\n2\n0ls v mW 2= (6.34)\n\nAssuming mass of the leg m\nl \n= 10 kg and slow running with a speed of 10 km in a hour which translates to\n\napproximately 3 m s-1, we obtain\n\nW\ns\n\n= 180 J /stride\n\nIf we take a stride to be 2 m long, the person covers 1.5 strides per second at his speed of  3 m s-1.  Thus the\npower expended\n\n     \n\n        =  270 W\n\nWe must bear in mind that this is a lower estimate since several avenues of power loss (e.g. swinging of hands,\nair resistance etc.) have been ignored.  The interesting point is that we did not worry about the forces involved.\nThe forces, mainly friction and those exerted on the leg by the muscles of the rest of the body, are hard to\nestimate. Static friction does no work and we bypassed the impossible task of estimating the work done by the\nmuscles by taking recourse to the work-energy theorem. We can also see the advantage of a wheel. The wheel\npermits smooth locomotion without the continual starting and stopping in mammalian locomotion.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 7.pmd\n\n\nCHAPTER SEVEN\n\nSYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROTATIONAL MOTION\n\n7.1 INTRODUCTION\n\nIn the earlier chapters we primarily considered the motion\nof a single particle. (A particle is ideally represented as a\npoint mass having no size.)  We applied the results of our\nstudy even to the motion of bodies of finite size, assuming\nthat motion of such bodies can be described in terms of the\nmotion of a particle.\n\nAny real body which we encounter in daily life has a\nfinite size.  In dealing with the motion of extended bodies\n(bodies of finite size) often the idealised model of a particle is\ninadequate.  In this chapter we shall try to go beyond this\ninadequacy.  We shall attempt to build an understanding of\nthe motion of extended bodies.  An extended body, in the\nfirst place, is a system of particles.  We shall begin with the\nconsideration of motion of the system as a whole.  The centre\nof mass of a system of particles will be a key concept here.\nWe shall discuss the motion of the centre of mass of a system\nof particles and usefulness of this concept in understanding\nthe motion of extended bodies.\n\nA large class of problems with extended bodies can be\nsolved by considering them to be rigid bodies.  Ideally a\nrigid body is a body with a perfectly definite and\nunchanging shape.  The distances between all pairs of\nparticles of such a body do not change. It is evident from\nthis definition of a rigid body that no real body is truly rigid,\nsince real bodies deform under the influence of forces. But in\nmany situations the deformations are negligible.  In a number\nof situations involving bodies such as wheels, tops, steel\nbeams, molecules and planets on the other hand, we can ignore\nthat they warp (twist out of shape), bend or vibrate and treat\nthem as rigid.\n\n7.1.1 What kind of motion can a rigid body have?\n\nLet us try to explore this question by taking some examples\nof the motion of rigid bodies.  Let us begin with a rectangular\n\n7.1 Introduction\n\n7.2 Centre of mass\n\n7.3 Motion of centre of mass\n\n7.4 Linear momentum of a\nsystem of particles\n\n7.5 Vector product of two\nvectors\n\n7.6 Angular velocity and its\nrelation with linear velocity\n\n7.7 Torque and angular\nmomentum\n\n7.8 Equilibrium of a rigid body\n\n7.9 Moment of inertia\n\n7.10 Theorems of perpendicular\nand parallel axes\n\n7.11 Kinematics of rotational\nmotion about a fixed axis\n\n7.12 Dynamics of rotational\nmotion about a fixed axis\n\n7.13 Angular momentum in case\nof rotation about a fixed axis\n\n7.14 Rolling motion\n\nSummary\n\nPoints to Ponder\n\nExercises\n\nAdditional exercises\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n142 PHYSICS\n\nblock sliding down an inclined plane without any\nsidewise movement.  The block is taken as a rigid\nbody.  Its motion down the plane is such that all\nthe particles of the body are moving together,\ni.e. they have the same velocity at any instant\nof time. The rigid body here is in pure\ntranslational motion (Fig. 7.1).\n\nIn pure translational motion at any\ninstant of time, all particles of the body have\nthe same velocity.\n\nConsider now the rolling motion of a solid\nmetallic or wooden cylinder down the same\ninclined plane (Fig. 7.2). The rigid body in this\nproblem, namely the cylinder, shifts from the\ntop to the bottom of the inclined plane, and thus,\nseems to have translational motion.  But as Fig.\n7.2 shows, all its particles are not moving with\nthe same velocity at any instant. The body,\ntherefore, is not in pure translational motion.\nIts motion is translational plus ‘something else.’\n\nIn order to understand what this ‘something\nelse’ is, let us take a rigid body so constrained\nthat it cannot have translational motion.  The\n\nmost common way to constrain a rigid body so\nthat it does not have translational motion is to\nfix it along a straight line. The only possible\nmotion of such a rigid body is rotation. The line\nor fixed axis about which the body is rotating is\nits axis of rotation. If you look around, you will\ncome across many examples of rotation about\nan axis, a ceiling fan, a potter’s wheel, a giant\nwheel in a fair, a merry-go-round and so on (Fig\n7.3(a) and (b)).\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\nFig. 7.3 Rotation about a fixed axis\n\n(a) A ceiling fan\n\n(b) A potter’s wheel.\n\nLet us try to understand what rotation is,\nwhat characterises rotation.  You may notice that\nin rotation of a rigid body about a fixed axis,\n\nFig 7.1 Translational (sliding) motion of a block down\nan inclined plane.\n\n(Any point like P\n1\n or P\n\n2 \nof the block moves\n\nwith the same velocity at any instant of time.)\n\nFig. 7.2 Rolling motion of a cylinder. It is not pure\ntranslational motion. Points P\n\n1\n, P\n\n2\n,\n \nP\n\n3\n and P\n\n4\n\nhave different velocities (shown by arrows)\n\nat any instant of time. In fact, the velocity of\n\nthe point of contact P\n3 \nis zero at any instant,\n\nif the cylinder rolls without slipping.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROTATIONAL MOTION 143\n\nevery particle of the body moves in a circle,\nwhich lies in a plane perpendicular to the axis\n\nand has its centre on the axis.  Fig. 7.4 shows\n\nthe rotational motion of a rigid body about a fixed\n\naxis (the z-axis of the frame of reference).  Let P\n1\n\nbe a particle of the rigid body, arbitrarily chosen\n\nand at a distance r\n1\n from fixed axis.  The particle\n\nP\n1\n describes a circle of radius  r\n\n1 \nwith its centre\n\nC\n1\n on the fixed axis.  The circle lies in a plane\n\nperpendicular to the axis. The figure also shows\n\nanother particle P\n2\n of the rigid body, P\n\n2 \nis at a\n\ndistance r\n2 \nfrom the fixed axis. The particle P\n\n2\n\nmoves in a circle of radius r\n2 \nand with centre C\n\n2\n\non the axis. This circle, too, lies in a plane\n\nperpendicular to the axis.  Note that the circles\n\ndescribed by P\n1\n and P\n\n2\n may lie in different planes;\n\nboth these planes, however, are perpendicular\n\nto the fixed axis.  For any particle on the axis\n\nlike P\n3\n, r = 0. Any such particle remains\n\nstationary while the body rotates.  This is\n\nexpected since the axis of rotation is fixed.\n\nFig. 7.5 (a) A spinning top\n(The point of contact of the top with the\n\nground, its tip O, is fixed.)\n\nFig. 7.5 (b) An oscillating table fan with rotating\nblades. The pivot of the fan, point O, is\n\nfixed. The blades of the fan are under\n\nrotational motion, whereas, the axis of\n\nrotation of  the fan blades is oscillating.\n\nFig. 7.4 A rigid body rotation about the z-axis (Each\npoint of the body such as P\n\n1\n or\n\nP\n2\n describes a circle with its centre (C\n\n1\n\nor C\n2\n) on the axis of rotation.  The radius of\n\nthe circle (r\n1\nor r\n\n2\n) is the perpendicular\n\ndistance of the point (P\n1\n or P\n\n2\n) from the\n\naxis. A point on the axis like P\n3 \n\nremains\n\nstationary).\n\nAxis of oscillation\n\nAxis of\nrotation\n\nfrom blades\n\nIn some examples of rotation, however, the\naxis may not be fixed.  A prominent example of\nthis kind of rotation is a top spinning in place\n[Fig. 7.5(a)].  (We assume that the top does not\nslip from place to place and so does not have\ntranslational motion.)  We know from experience\nthat the axis of such a spinning top moves\naround the vertical through its point of contact\nwith the ground, sweeping out a cone as shown\nin Fig. 7.5(a).  (This movement of the axis of the\ntop around the vertical is termed precession.)\nNote, the point of contact of the top with\nground is fixed. The axis of rotation of the top\nat any instant passes through the point of\ncontact. Another simple example of this kind of\nrotation is the oscillating table fan or a pedestal\nfan [Fig.7.5(b)]. You may have observed that the\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n144 PHYSICS\n\naxis of rotation of such a fan has an oscillating\n(sidewise) movement in a horizontal plane about\nthe vertical through the point at which the axis\nis pivoted (point O in Fig. 7.5(b)).\n\nWhile the fan rotates and its axis moves\nsidewise, this point is fixed.  Thus, in more\ngeneral cases of rotation, such as the rotation\nof a top or a pedestal fan, one point and not\none line, of the rigid body is fixed. In this case\nthe axis is not fixed, though it always passes\nthrough the fixed point. In our study, however,\nwe mostly deal with the simpler and special case\nof rotation in which one line (i.e. the axis) is fixed.\n\nThus, for us rotation will be about a fixed axis\nonly unless stated otherwise.\n\nThe rolling motion of a cylinder down an\ninclined plane is a combination of rotation about\na fixed axis and translation.  Thus, the\n‘something else’ in the case of rolling motion\nwhich we referred to earlier is rotational motion.\nYou will find Fig. 7.6(a) and (b) instructive from\nthis point of view. Both these figures show\nmotion of the same body along identical\ntranslational trajectory. In one case, Fig. 7.6(a),\nthe motion is a pure translation; in the other\ncase [Fig. 7.6(b)] it is a combination of\ntranslation and rotation. (You may try to\nreproduce the two types of motion shown, using\na rigid object like a heavy book.)\n\nWe now recapitulate the most important\nobservations of the present section: The motion\nof a rigid body which is not pivoted or fixed in\nsome way is either a pure translation or a\ncombination of translation and rotation. The\nmotion of a rigid body which is pivoted or fixed\nin some way is rotation.  The rotation may be\nabout an axis that is fixed (e.g. a ceiling fan) or\nmoving (e.g. an oscillating table fan [Fig.7.5(b)]).\nWe shall, in the present chapter, consider\nrotational motion about a fixed axis only.\n\n7.2  CENTRE OF MASS\n\nWe shall first see what the centre of mass of a\nsystem of particles is and then discuss its\nsignificance. For simplicity we shall start with\na two particle system. We shall take the line\njoining the two particles to be the x- axis.\n\nFig. 7.7\n\nLet the distances of the two particles be x\n1\n\nand x\n2\n respectively from some origin O. Let m\n\n1\n\nand m\n2\n be respectively the masses of the two\n\nFig. 7.6(a) Motion of a rigid body which is pure\n\ntranslation.\n\nFig. 7.6(b) Motion of a rigid body which is a\ncombination of translation and\n\nrotation.\n\nFig 7.6 (a) and 7.6 (b) illustrate different motions of\n\nthe same body. Note P is an arbitrary point of the\n\nbody; O is the centre of mass of the body, which is\n\ndefined in the next section. Suffice to say here that\n\nthe trajectories of O are the translational trajectories\n\nTr\n1\n and Tr\n\n2 \nof the body. The positions O and P at\n\nthree different instants of time are shown by O\n1\n, O\n\n2\n,\n\nand O\n3\n, and P\n\n1\n, P\n\n2\n and P\n\n3\n, respectively, in both\n\nFigs. 7.6 (a) and (b) . As seen from Fig. 7.6(a), at any\n\ninstant the velocities of any particles like O and P of\n\nthe body are the same in pure translation. Notice, in\n\nthis case the orientation of OP, i.e. the angle OP makes\n\nwith a fixed direction, say the horizontal, remains\n\nthe same, i.e. α\n1 \n\n= α\n2\n = α\n\n3\n. Fig. 7.6 (b) illustrates a\n\ncase of combination of translation and rotation. In\n\nthis case, at any instants the velocities of O and P\n\ndiffer. Also, α\n1\n, α\n\n2\n and α\n\n3\n may all be different.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROTATIONAL MOTION 145\n\nparticles. The centre of mass of the system is\nthat   point C which is at a distance X from O,\nwhere X is given by\n\n1 1 2 2\n\n1 2\n\nm x m x\nX\n\nm m\n\n+\n=\n\n+ (7.1)\n\nIn Eq. (7.1), X can be regarded as the mass-\nweighted mean of  x\n\n1 \nand x\n\n2\n. If the two particles\n\nhave the same mass m\n1\n = m\n\n2\n = m\n\n, \nthen\n\n1 2 1 2\n\n2 2\n\nmx mx x x\nX\n\nm\n\n+ +\n= =\n\nThus, for two particles of equal mass the\ncentre of mass lies exactly midway between\nthem.\n\n       If we have n particles of masses m\n1\n, m\n\n2\n,\n\n...m\nn\n respectively, along a straight line taken as\n\nthe x- axis, then by definition the position of the\ncentre of the mass of the system of particles is\ngiven by.\n\nX\nm x m x m x\n\nm m m\n\nm x\n\nm\n\nm x\n\nm\nn n\n\nn\n\ni i\n\ni\n\nn\n\ni\n\ni\n\nn\n\ni i\n\ni\n\n= = =\n=\n\n=\n\n∑\n\n∑\n\n∑\n∑\n\n1 1 2 2\n\n1 2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n+ + ... +\n\n+ +... +\n  (7.2)\n\nwhere  x\n1\n, x\n\n2\n,...x\n\nn\n are the distances of the\n\nparticles from the origin; X is also measured from\n\nthe same origin. The symbol \uf001 (the Greek letter\nsigma) denotes summation, in this case over n\nparticles. The sum\n\nim M=\uf001\nis the total mass of the system.\n\nSuppose that we have three particles, not\nlying in a straight line. We may define x– and y–\naxes in the plane in which the particles lie and\nrepresent the positions of the three particles by\ncoordinates (x\n\n1\n,y\n\n1\n), (x\n\n2\n,y\n\n2\n) and (x\n\n3\n,y\n\n3\n) respectively.\n\nLet the masses of the three particles be m\n1\n, m\n\n2\n\nand m\n3 \nrespectively. The centre of mass C of\n\nthe system of the three particles is defined and\nlocated by the coordinates (X, Y) given by\n\n1 1 2 2 3 3\n\n1 2 3\n\nm x m x m x\nX\n\nm m m\n\n+ +\n=\n\n+ + (7.3a)\n\n1 1 2 2 3 3\n\n1 2 3\n\nm y m y m y\nY\n\nm m m\n\n+ +\n=\n\n+ + (7.3b)\n\nFor the particles of equal mass m = m\n1\n = m\n\n2\n\n= m\n3\n,\n\n1 2 3 1 2 3( )\n\n3 3\n\nm x x x x x x\nX\n\nm\n\n+ + + +\n= =\n\n1 2 3 1 2 3( )\n\n3 3\n\nm y y y y y y\nY\n\nm\n\n+ + + +\n= =\n\nThus, for three particles of equal mass, the\ncentre of mass coincides with the centroid of the\ntriangle formed by the particles.\n\nResults of Eqs. (7.3a) and (7.3b) are\ngeneralised easily to a system of n particles, not\nnecessarily lying in a plane, but distributed in\nspace. The centre of mass of such a system is\nat (X, Y, Z ), where\n\ni im x\nX\n\nM\n= \uf001 (7.4a)\n\ni im y\nY\n\nM\n= \uf001 (7.4b)\n\nand  \ni im z\n\nZ\nM\n\n= \uf001 (7.4c)\n\nHere M = im\uf001 is the total mass of the\nsystem. The index i runs from 1 to n; m\n\ni\n is the\n\nmass of the ith particle and the position of the\nith particle is given by (x\n\ni\n, y\n\ni\n, z\n\ni\n).\n\nEqs. (7.4a), (7.4b) and (7.4c) can be\ncombined into one equation using the notation\n\nof position vectors. Let  ir  be the position vector\n\nof the ith particle and R be the position vector of\nthe centre of mass:\n\n \uf001\ni i i ix y z= + +r i j k\n\n\uf002 \uf002\n\nand \uf001X Y Z= + +R i j k\uf002 \uf002\n\nThen  \ni im\n\nM\n= \uf001 rR (7.4d)\n\nThe sum on the right hand side is a vector\nsum.\n\nNote the economy of expressions we achieve\nby use of vectors. If the origin of the frame of\nreference (the coordinate system) is chosen to\n\nbe the centre of mass then  0i im =\uf001 r for the\ngiven system of particles.\n\nA rigid body, such as a metre stick or a\nflywheel, is a system of closely packed particles;\nEqs. (7.4a), (7.4b), (7.4c) and (7.4d) are\ntherefore, applicable to a rigid body. The number\nof particles (atoms or molecules) in such a body\nis so large that it is impossible to carry out the\nsummations over individual particles in these\nequations. Since the spacing of the particles is\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n146 PHYSICS\n\nsmall, we can treat the body as a continuous\ndistribution of mass. We subdivide the body into\nn small elements of mass;  ∆m\n\n1\n, ∆m\n\n2\n... ∆m\n\nn\n; the\n\nith element  ∆m\ni \nis taken to be located about the\n\npoint  (x\ni\n, y\n\ni\n, z\n\ni\n). The coordinates of the centre of\n\nmass are then approximately given by\n\n( ) ( ) ( )\n, ,\n\ni i i i i i\n\ni i i\n\nm x m y m z\nX Y Z\n\nm m m\n\n∆ ∆ ∆\n= = =\n\n∆ ∆ ∆\n\uf001 \uf001 \uf001\n\uf001 \uf001 \uf001\n\nAs we make n bigger and bigger and each\n∆m\n\ni\n smaller and smaller, these expressions\n\nbecome exact. In that case, we denote the sums\nover i by integrals. Thus,\n\n∆m m Mi → =∫∑ d ,\n\n( ) ,∆m x x mi i → ∫∑ d\n\n( ) ,∆m y y mi i → ∫∑ d\n\n and (∆m z z mi i) → ∫∑ d\nHere M is the total mass of the body. The\n\ncoordinates of the centre of mass now are\n\nX\nM\n\nx m Y\nM\n\ny m Z\nM\n\nz m= = =∫∫ ∫\n1 1 1\n\nd d d, and   (7.5a)\n\nThe vector expression equivalent to these\nthree scalar expressions is\n\nR r= ∫\n1\n\nM\nmd (7.5b)\n\nIf we choose, the centre of mass as the origin\nof our coordinate system,\n\n=R 0\n\ni.e., r 0dm =∫\nor x m y m z md d d= = =∫ ∫∫ 0 (7.6)\n\nOften we have to calculate the centre of mass\nof homogeneous bodies of regular shapes like\nrings, discs, spheres, rods etc. (By a\nhomogeneous body we mean a body with\nuniformly distributed mass.) By using symmetry\nconsideration, we can easily show that the\ncentres of mass of these bodies lie at their\ngeometric centres.\n\nLet us consider a thin rod, whose width and\nbreath (in case the cross section of the rod is\nrectangular) or radius (in case the cross section\nof the rod is cylindrical) is much smaller than\nits length. Taking the origin to be at the\ngeometric centre of the rod and x-axis to be\nalong the length of the rod, we can say that on\naccount of reflection symmetry, for every\nelement dm of the rod at x, there is an element\nof the same mass dm located at –x (Fig. 7.8).\n\nThe net contribution of every such pair to\n\nthe integral and hence the integral  itself\n\nis zero.  From Eq. (7.6), the point for which the\nintegral  itself is zero, is the centre of mass.\nThus, the centre of mass of a homogenous thin\nrod coincides with its geometric centre. This can\nbe understood on the basis of reflection symmetry.\n\nThe same symmetry argument will apply to\nhomogeneous rings, discs, spheres, or even\nthick rods of circular or rectangular cross\nsection. For all such bodies you will realise that\nfor every element dm at a point (x, y, z ) one can\nalways take an element of the same mass at\nthe point (–x, –y, –z ). (In other words, the origin\nis a point of reflection symmetry for these\nbodies.) As a result, the integrals in Eq. (7.5 a)\nall are zero. This means that for all the above\nbodies, their centre of mass coincides with their\ngeometric centre.\n\nExample 7.1 Find the centre of mass of\nthree particles at the vertices of an\nequilateral triangle.

If we join the midpoint of\nall the strips we get the median LP. The centre\nof mass of the triangle as a whole therefore, has\nto lie on the median LP. Similarly, we can argue\nthat it lies on the median MQ and NR. This\nmeans the centre of mass lies on the point of\n\nconcurrence of the medians, i.e. on the centroid\nG of the triangle.       \uf074\n\nExample 7.3 Find the centre of mass of a\nuniform L-shaped lamina (a thin flat plate)\nwith dimensions as shown. The mass of\nthe lamina is 3 kg.\n\nAnswer  Choosing the X and Y axes as shown\nin Fig. 7.11 we have the coordinates of the\nvertices of the L-shaped lamina as given in the\nfigure. We can think of the\nL-shape to consist of 3 squares each of length\n1m. The mass of each square is 1kg, since the\nlamina is uniform. The centres of mass C\n\n1\n, C\n\n2\n\nand C\n3\n of the squares are, by symmetry, their\n\ngeometric centres and have coordinates (1/2,1/2),\n(3/2,1/2), (1/2,3/2) respectively. We take the\nmasses of the squares to be concentrated at\nthese points. The centre of mass of the whole\nL shape (X, Y) is the centre of mass of these\nmass points.\n\nFig. 7.11\n\nHence\n\n[ ]\n( )\n\n1(1/2) 1(3/2) 1(1/2) kg m\n\n1 1 1 kg\nX\n\n+ +\n=\n\n+ +  \n5\n\nm\n6\n\n=\n\n[ ]\n( )\n\n1(1/2) 1(1/2) 1(3/2) kg m 5\nm\n\n1 1 1 kg 6\nY\n\n  + +\n  = =\n\n+ +\n\nThe centre of mass of the L-shape lies on\nthe line OD.

How will you\nthen determine the centre of mass of the lamina?\n\uf074\n\n7.3  MOTION OF CENTRE OF MASS\n\nEquipped with the definition of the centre of\n\nmass, we are now in a position to discuss its\n\nphysical importance for a system of n particles.\n\nWe may rewrite Eq.(7.4d) as\n\n1 1 2 2 ...i i n nM m m m m= = + + +\uf001R r r r r (7.7)\nDifferentiating the two sides of the equation\n\nwith respect to time we get\n\n1 2\n1 2\n\ndd dd\n...\n\nd d d\nn\n\nn\nM m m m\n\nt t t dt\n= + + +\n\nrr rR\n\nor\n\n1 1 2 2 ... n nM m m m= + + +V v v v (7.8)\n\nwhere  ( )1 1d /dt=v r  is the velocity of the first\nparticle ( )2 2d dt=v r is the velocity of the\nsecond particle etc. and d /dt=V R  is the\nvelocity of the centre of mass. Note that we\n\nassumed the masses m\n1\n, m\n\n2\n, ... etc. do not\n\nchange in time. We have therefore, treated them\n\nas constants in differentiating the equations\n\nwith respect to time.\n\nDifferentiating Eq.(7.8) with respect to time,\nwe obtain\n\n1 2\n1 2\n\ndd dd\n...\n\nd d d d\nn\n\nnM m m m\nt t t t\n\n= + + +\nvv vV\n\nor\n\n1 1 2 2\n...\n\nn n\nM m m m= + + +A a a a (7.9)\n\nwhere ( )1 1d /dt=a v  is the acceleration of the\nfirst particle,  ( )2 2d /dt=a v  is the acceleration\nof the second particle etc. and  ( )d /dt=A V  is\nthe acceleration of the centre of mass of the\nsystem of particles.\n\nNow, from Newton’s second law, the force\n\nacting on the first particle is given by 1 1 1m=F a .\nThe force acting on the second particle is given\n\nby 2 2 2m=F a and so on. Eq. (7.9) may be written\nas\n\n1 2 ... nM = + + +A F F F (7.10)\n\nThus, the total mass of a system of particles\ntimes the acceleration of its centre of mass is\nthe vector sum of all the forces acting on the\nsystem of particles.\n\nNote when we talk of the force 1F on the first\n\nparticle, it is not a single force, but the vector\nsum of all the forces on the first particle; likewise\nfor the second particle etc. Among these forces\non each particle there will be external forces\nexerted by bodies outside the system and also\ninternal forces exerted by the particles on one\nanother. We know from Newton’s third law that\nthese internal forces occur in equal and opposite\npairs and in the sum of forces of Eq. (7.10),\ntheir contribution is zero. Only the external\nforces contribute to the equation. We can then\nrewrite Eq. (7.10) as\n\nextM =A F (7.11)\n\nwhere extF  represents the sum of all external\n\nforces acting on the particles of the system.\nEq. (7.11) states that the centre of mass\n\nof a system of particles moves as if all the\nmass of the system was concentrated at the\ncentre of mass and all the external forces\nwere applied at that point.\n\nNotice, to determine the motion of the centre\nof mass no knowledge of internal forces of the\nsystem of particles is required; for this purpose\nwe need to know only the external forces.\n\nTo obtain Eq. (7.11) we did not need to\nspecify the nature of the system of particles.\nThe system may be a collection of particles in\nwhich there may be all kinds of internal\nmotions, or it may be a rigid body which has\neither pure translational motion or a\ncombination of translational and rotational\nmotion. Whatever is the system and the motion\nof its individual particles, the centre of mass\nmoves according to Eq. (7.11).\n\nInstead of treating extended bodies as single\nparticles as we have done in earlier chapters,\nwe can now treat them as systems of particles.\nWe can obtain the translational component of\ntheir motion, i.e. the motion of the centre of mass\nof the system, by taking the mass of the whole\nsystem to be concentrated at the centre of mass\nand all the external forces on the system to be\nacting at the centre of mass.\n\nThis is the procedure that we followed earlier\nin analysing forces on bodies and solving\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROTATIONAL MOTION 149\n\nproblems without explicitly outlining and\njustifying the procedure. We now realise that in\nearlier studies we assumed, without saying so,\nthat rotational motion and/or internal motion\nof the particles were either absent or negligible.\nWe no longer need to do this. We have not only\nfound the justification of the procedure we\nfollowed earlier; but we also have found how to\ndescribe and separate the translational motion\nof (1) a rigid body which may be rotating as\nwell,  or (2) a system of particles with all kinds\nof internal motion.\n\nFig. 7.12 The centre of mass of the fragments\nof the projectile continues along the\n\nsame parabolic path which it would\n\nhave followed if there were no\n\nexplosion.\n\nFigure 7.12 is a good illustration of Eq.\n(7.11). A projectile, following the usual parabolic\ntrajectory, explodes into fragments midway in\nair. The forces leading to the explosion are\ninternal forces. They contribute nothing to the\nmotion of the centre of mass. The total external\nforce, namely, the force of gravity acting on the\nbody, is the same before and after the explosion.\nThe centre of mass under the influence of the\nexternal force continues, therefore, along the\nsame parabolic trajectory as it would have\nfollowed if there were no explosion.\n\n7.4 LINEAR MOMENTUM OF A SYSTEM OF\nPARTICLES\n\nLet us recall that the linear momentum of a\nparticle is defined as\n\nm=p v (7.12)\nLet us also recall that Newton’s second law\n\nwritten in symbolic form for a single particle is\n\nd\n\ndt\n=\n\np\nF (7.13)\n\nwhere F is the force on the particle. Let us\nconsider a system of n particles with masses m\n\n1\n,\n\nm\n2\n,...m\n\nn \nrespectively and velocities 1 2, ,....... nv v v\n\nrespectively. The particles may be interacting\nand have external forces acting on them. The\n\nlinear momentum of the first particle is 1 1m v ,\n\nof the second particle is 2 2m v  and so on.\n\nFor the system of n particles, the linear\nmomentum of the system is defined to be the\nvector sum of all individual particles of the\nsystem,\n\n1 2 ... n= + + +P p p p\n\n1 1 2 2 ... n nm m m= + + +v v v (7.14)\nComparing this with Eq. (7.8)\n\nM=P V (7.15)\nThus, the total momentum of a system\n\nof particles is equal to the product of the\ntotal mass of the system and the velocity of\nits centre of mass. Differentiating Eq. (7.15)\nwith respect to time,\n\nd d\n\nd d\nM M\n\nt t\n= =\n\nP V\nA (7.16)\n\nComparing Eq.(7.16) and Eq. (7.11),\n\nd\n\nd\next\n\nt\n=\n\nP\nF (7.17)\n\nThis is the statement of Newton’s second law\nof motion extended to a system of particles.\n\nSuppose now, that the sum of external\nforces acting on a system of particles is zero.\nThen from Eq.(7.17)\n\nor\nd\n\n0\ndt\n\n=\nP\n\nP  = Constant (7.18a)\n\nThus, when the total external force acting\non a system of particles is zero, the total linear\nmomentum of the system is constant. This is\nthe law of conservation of the total linear\nmomentum of a system of particles. Because of\nEq. (7.15), this also means that when the\ntotal external force on the system is zero\nthe velocity of the centre of mass remains\nconstant. (We assume throughout the\ndiscussion on systems of particles in this\nchapter that the total mass of the system\nremains constant.)\n\nNote that on account of the internal forces,\ni.e. the forces exerted by the particles on one\nanother, the individual particles may have\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n150 PHYSICS\n\ncomplicated trajectories. Yet, if the total external\nforce acting on the system is zero, the centre of\nmass moves with a constant velocity, i.e., moves\nuniformly in a straight line like a free particle.\n\nThe vector Eq. (7.18a) is equivalent to three\nscalar equations,\n\nP\nx\n = c\n\n1\n, P\n\ny\n = c\n\n2\n and P\n\nz\n = c\n\n3\n(7.18 b)\n\nHere P\nx\n, P\n\ny\n and P\n\nz\n are the components of the\n\ntotal linear momentum vector P along the x–, y–\nand z–axes respectively; c\n\n1\n, c\n\n2\n and c\n\n3\n are\n\nconstants.\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFig. 7.13 (a) A heavy nucleus radium (Ra) splits into\na lighter nucleus radon (Rn) and an alpha\n\nparticle (nucleus of helium atom). The CM\n\nof the system is in uniform motion.\n\n(b) The same spliting of the heavy nucleus\nradium (Ra) with the centre of mass at\n\nrest. The two product particles fly back\n\nto back.\n\nAs an example, let us consider the\nradioactive decay of a moving unstable particle,\nlike the nucleus of radium. A radium nucleus\ndisintegrates into a nucleus of radon and an\nalpha particle. The forces leading to the decay\nare internal to the system and the external\nforces on the system are negligible. So the total\nlinear momentum of the system is the same\nbefore and after decay. The two particles\nproduced in the decay, the radon nucleus and\nthe alpha particle, move in different directions\nin such a way that their centre of mass moves\nalong the same path along which the original\ndecaying radium nucleus was moving\n[Fig. 7.13(a)].\n\nIf we observe the decay from the frame of\nreference in which the centre of mass is at rest,\nthe motion of the particles involved in the decay\nlooks particularly simple; the product particles\n\nmove back to back with their centre of mass\nremaining at rest as shown in Fig.7.13 (b).\n\nIn many problems on the system of\nparticles, as in the above radioactive decay\nproblem, it is convenient to work in the centre\nof mass frame rather than in the laboratory\nframe of reference.\n\nIn astronomy, binary (double) stars is a\ncommon occurrence. If there are no external\nforces, the centre of mass of a double star\nmoves like a free particle, as shown in Fig.7.14\n(a). The trajectories of the two stars of equal\nmass are also shown in the figure; they look\ncomplicated. If we go to the centre of mass\nframe, then we find that there the two stars\nare moving in a circle, about the centre of\nmass, which is at rest. Note that the position\nof the stars have to be diametrically opposite\nto each other [Fig. 7.14(b)]. Thus in our frame\nof reference, the trajectories of the stars are a\ncombination of (i) uniform motion in a straight\nline of the centre of mass and (ii) circular\norbits of the stars about the centre of mass.\n\nAs can be seen from the two examples,\nseparating the motion of different parts of a\nsystem into motion of the centre of mass and\nmotion about the centre of mass is a very\nuseful technique that helps in understanding\nthe motion of the system.\n\n7.5  VECTOR PRODUCT OF TWO VECTORS\n\nWe are already familiar with vectors and their\nuse in physics. In chapter 6 (Work, Energy,\nPower) we defined the scalar product of two\nvectors. An important physical quantity, work,\nis defined as a scalar product of two vector\nquantities, force and displacement.\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFig. 7.14 (a) Trajectories of two stars, S\n1\n (dotted\n\nline) and S\n2\n (solid line) forming a\n\nbinary system with their centre of\n\nmass C in uniform motion.\n\n(b) The same binary system, with the\ncentre of mass C at rest.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROTATIONAL MOTION 151\n\nWe shall now define another product of two\nvectors. This product is a vector. Two important\nquantities in the study of rotational motion,\nnamely, moment of a force and angular\nmomentum, are defined as vector products.\n\nDefinition of Vector Product\n\nA vector product of two vectors a and b is a\nvector c such that\n\n(i) magnitude of c = c sinab θ=  where a and b\nare magnitudes of  a and b and θ is the\nangle between the two vectors.\n\n(ii) c is perpendicular to the plane containing\na and b.\n\n(iii) if we take a right handed screw with its head\nlying in the plane of  a and b and the screw\nperpendicular to this plane, and if we turn\nthe head in the direction from  a to b, then\nthe tip of the screw advances in the direction\nof c. This right handed screw rule is\nillustrated in Fig. 7.15a.\nAlternately, if one curls up the fingers of\n\nright hand around a line perpendicular to the\nplane of the vectors  a and b and if the fingers\nare curled up in the direction from a to b, then\nthe stretched thumb points in the direction of\nc, as shown in Fig. 7.15b.\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFig. 7.15 (a) Rule of the right handed screw for\ndefining the direction of the vector\n\nproduct of two vectors.\n\n                (b) Rule of the right hand for defining the\n\ndirection of the vector product.\n\nA simpler version of the right hand rule is\nthe following : Open up your right hand palm\nand curl the fingers pointing from  a to b. Your\nstretched thumb points in the direction of c.\n\nIt should be remembered that there are two\nangles between any two vectors  a and b . In\nFig. 7.15 (a) or (b) they correspond to θ (as\nshown) and (3600– θ). While applying either of\nthe above rules, the rotation should be taken\nthrough the smaller angle (<1800) between  a\nand b. It is θ here.\n\nBecause of the cross (×) used to denote the\nvector product, it is also referred to as cross product.\n\n• Note that scalar product of two vectors is\ncommutative as said earlier, a.b = b.a\nThe vector product, however, is not\n\ncommutative, i.e. a × b ≠ b × a\nThe magnitude of both a × b and b × a is the\n\nsame ( sinab θ ); also, both of them are\nperpendicular to the plane of  a and b. But the\nrotation of the right-handed screw in case of\na × b  is from  a to b, whereas in case of  b × a it\nis from b to a. This means the two vectors are\nin opposite directions. We have\n\n× = − ×a b b a\n• Another interesting property of a vector\n\nproduct is its behaviour under reflection.\nUnder reflection (i.e. on taking the plane\nmirror image) we have\n\nand ,x x y y z z→ − → − → − . As a result all\nthe components of a vector change sign and\n\nthus ,a a→ − b b→ − . What happens to\na × b under reflection?\n\na × b ( ) ( )→ − × − = ×a b a b\nThus, a × b does not change sign under\n\nreflection.\n\n• Both scalar and vector products are\ndistributive with respect to vector addition.\nThus,\n\n.( ) . .+ = +a b c a b a c\n\n( )× + = × + ×a b c a b a c\n• We may write c = a × b in the component\n\nform. For this we first need to obtain some\nelementary cross products:\n\n(i) a × a = 0 (0 is a null vector, i.e. a vector\nwith zero magnitude)\n\nThis follows since magnitude of a × a  is\n\n2 sin0 0a ° = .\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n152 PHYSICS\n\n\uf075\n\nFrom this follow the results\n\n (i) ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ, ,× = × = × =i i 0 j j 0 k k 0\n\n(ii) ˆ ˆ ˆ× =i j k\n\nNote that the magnitude of ˆ ˆ×i j  is sin900\n\nor 1, since î  and ĵ  both have unit\n\nmagnitude and the angle between them is 900.\n\nThus, ˆ ˆ×i j  is a unit vector. A unit vector\n\nperpendicular to the plane of î  and ĵ  and\n\nrelated to them by the right hand screw rule is\n\nk̂ . Hence, the above result.

We\nhave seen that every particle of a rotating body\nmoves in a circle. The linear velocity of the\nparticle is related to the angular velocity. The\nrelation between these two quantities involves\na vector product which we learnt about in the\nlast section.\n\nLet us go back to Fig. 7.4. As said above, in\nrotational motion of a rigid body about a fixed\naxis, every particle of the body moves in a circle,\n\nFig. 7.16 Rotation about a fixed axis. (A particle (P)\nof the rigid body rotating about the fixed\n\n(z-) axis moves in a circle with centre (C)\n\non the axis.)\n\nwhich lies in a plane perpendicular to the axis\nand has its centre on the axis. In Fig. 7.16 we\nredraw Fig. 7.4, showing a typical particle (at a\npoint P) of the rigid body rotating about a fixed\naxis (taken as the z-axis). The particle describes\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROTATIONAL MOTION 153\n\na circle with a centre C on the axis. The radius\nof the circle is r, the perpendicular distance of\nthe point P from the axis. We also show the\nlinear velocity vector v of the particle at P. It is\nalong the tangent at P to the circle.\n\nLet P′ be the position of the particle after an\ninterval of time ∆t (Fig. 7.16). The angle PCP′\ndescribes the angular displacement ∆θ of the\nparticle in time ∆t. The average angular velocity\nof the particle over the interval  ∆t is ∆θ/∆t. As\n∆t tends to zero (i.e. takes smaller and smaller\nvalues), the ratio ∆θ/∆t approaches a limit which\nis the instantaneous angular velocity dθ/dt of\nthe particle at the position P. We denote the\ninstantaneous angular velocity by  ω (the\nGreek letter omega). We know from our study\nof circular motion that the magnitude of linear\nvelocity  v of a particle moving in a circle is\nrelated to the angular velocity of the particle ω\nby the simple relation rυ ω= , where r is the\nradius of the circle.\n\nWe observe that at any given instant the\nrelation  v rω=  applies to  all particles of the\nrigid body. Thus for a particle at a perpendicular\ndistance r\n\ni\n  from the fixed axis, the linear velocity\n\nat a given instant v\ni\n is given by\n\ni i\nv rω= (7.19)\nThe index i runs from 1 to n, where n is the\n\ntotal number of particles of the body.\n\nFor particles on the axis, 0=r , and hence\nv = ω r = 0. Thus, particles on the axis are\nstationary. This verifies that the axis is fixed.\n\nNote that we use the same angular velocity\nω for all the particles. We therefore, refer to  ωωωωω\nas the angular velocity of the whole body.\n\nWe have characterised pure translation of\n\na body by all parts of the body having the same\nvelocity at any instant of time. Similarly, we\n\nmay characterise pure rotation by all parts of\n\nthe body having the same angular velocity at\nany instant of time. Note that this\n\ncharacterisation of the rotation of a rigid body\n\nabout a fixed axis is just another way of saying\nas in Sec. 7.1 that each particle of the body moves\n\nin a circle, which lies in a plane perpendicular\n\nto the axis and has the centre on the axis.\nIn our discussion so far the angular velocity\n\nappears to be a scalar. In fact, it is a vector. We\nshall not justify this fact, but we shall accept\nit. For rotation about a fixed axis, the angular\nvelocity vector lies along the axis of rotation,\n\nand points out in the direction in which a right\nhanded screw would advance, if the head of the\nscrew is rotated with the body. (See Fig. 7.17a).\n\nThe magnitude of this vector is d dtω θ=\nreferred as above.\n\nFig. 7.17 (a) If the head of a right handed screw\nrotates with the body, the screw\n\nadvances in the direction of the angular\n\nvelocity ωωωωω. If the sense (clockwise or\nanticlockwise) of rotation of the body\n\nchanges, so does the direction of ωωωωω.\n\nFig. 7.17 (b) The angular velocity vector ωωωωω is\ndirected along the fixed axis as shown.\n\nThe linear velocity of the particle at P\n\nis v = ωωωωω × r. It is  perpendicular to both\nω ω ω ω ω and r and is  directed along the\ntangent to the circle described by the\n\nparticle.\n\nWe shall now look at what the vector product\nωωωωω × r corresponds to. Refer to Fig. 7.17(b) which\nis a part of Fig. 7.16 reproduced to show the\npath of the particle P. The figure shows the\nvector ωωωωω directed along the fixed (z–) axis and\nalso the position vector  r = OP  of the particle\n\nat P of the rigid body with respect to the origin\nO. Note that the origin is chosen to be on the\naxis of rotation.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n154 PHYSICS\n\nNow ωωωωω × r = ωωωωω × OP = ωωωωω × (OC + CP)\nBut ωωωωω × OC = 0 0 0 0 0 as ω ω ω ω ω is along OC\nHence ωωωωω × r = ωωωωω × CP\n\nThe vector ωωωωω × CP is perpendicular to ωωωωω, i.e.\nto the z-axis and also to CP, the radius of the\n\ncircle described by the particle at P. It is\n\ntherefore, along the tangent to the circle at P.\n\nAlso, the magnitude of  ωωωωω × CP is ω (CP) since\nωωωωω and CP are perpendicular to each other. We\nshall denote CP by ⊥r  and not by r, as we did\n\nearlier.\n\nThus, ωωωωω × r is a vector of magnitude ωr⊥\nand is along the tangent to the circle described\nby the particle at P. The linear velocity vector v\nat P has the same magnitude and direction.\nThus,\n\nv = ω ω ω ω ω × r (7.20)\nIn fact, the relation, Eq. (7.20), holds good\n\neven for rotation of a rigid body with one point\nfixed, such as the rotation of the top [Fig. 7.6(a)].\nIn this case r represents the position vector of\nthe particle with respect to the fixed point taken\nas the origin.\n\nWe note that for rotation about a fixed\naxis, the direction of the vector ωωωωω does not\nchange with time. Its magnitude may,\nhowever, change from instant to instant. For\nthe more general rotation, both the\nmagnitude and the direction of ω ω ω ω ω may change\nfrom instant to instant.\n\n7.6.1 Angular acceleration\n\nYou may have noticed that we are developing\n\nthe study of rotational motion along the lines\n\nof the study of translational motion with which\n\nwe are already familiar. Analogous to the kinetic\n\nvariables of linear displacement (s) and velocity\n\n(v) in translational motion, we have angular\n\ndisplacement (θθθθθ) and angular velocity (ωωωωω) in\nrotational motion. It is then natural to define\n\nin rotational motion the concept of angular\n\nacceleration in analogy with linear acceleration\n\ndefined as the time rate of change of velocity in\n\ntranslational motion. We define angular\n\nacceleration ααααα as the time rate of change of\nangular velocity; Thus,\n\nd\n\ndt\n=\n\nωωωω\nαααα (7.21)\n\nIf the axis of rotation is fixed, the direction\nof ω ω ω ω ω and hence, that of ααααα is fixed. In this case\nthe vector equation reduces to a scalar equation\n\nd\n\ndt\n\nω\nα = (7.22)\n\n7.7  TORQUE AND ANGULAR MOMENTUM\n\nIn this section, we shall acquaint ourselves with\ntwo physical quantities (torque and angular\nmomentum) which are defined as vector products\nof two vectors. These as we shall see, are\nespecially important in the discussion of motion\nof systems of particles, particularly rigid bodies.\n\n7.7.1 Moment of force (Torque)\n\nWe have learnt that the motion of a rigid body,\n\nin general, is a combination of rotation and\n\ntranslation. If the body is fixed at a point or along\n\na line, it has only rotational motion. We know\n\nthat force is needed to change the translational\n\nstate of a body, i.e. to produce linear\n\nacceleration. We may then ask, what is the\n\nanalogue of force in the case of rotational\n\nmotion? To look into the question in a concrete\n\nsituation let us take the example of opening or\n\nclosing of a door. A door is a rigid body which\n\ncan rotate about a fixed vertical axis passing\n\nthrough the hinges. What makes the door\n\nrotate? It is clear that unless a force is applied\n\nthe door does not rotate. But any force does not\n\ndo the job. A force applied to the hinge line\n\ncannot produce any rotation at all, whereas a\n\nforce of given magnitude applied at right angles\n\nto the door at its outer edge is most effective in\n\nproducing rotation. It is not the force alone, but\n\nhow and where the force is applied is important\n\nin rotational motion.\n\nThe rotational analogue of force in linear\n\nmotion is moment of force. It is also referred to\n\nas torque or couple. (We shall use the words\n\nmoment of force and torque interchangeably.)\n\nWe shall first define the moment of force for the\n\nspecial case of a single particle. Later on we\n\nshall extend the concept to systems of particles\n\nincluding rigid bodies. We shall also relate it to\n\na change in the state of rotational motion, i.e. is\n\nangular acceleration of a rigid body.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROTATIONAL MOTION 155\n\nFig. 7.18 τ = τ = τ = τ = τ = r ×  ×  ×  ×  × F, τ τ τ τ τ is perpendicular to the plane\ncontaining r and F, and its direction is\n\ngiven by the right handed screw rule.\n\nIf a force acts on a single particle at a point\nP whose position with respect to the origin O is\ngiven by the position vector r (Fig. 7.18), the\nmoment of the force acting on the particle with\nrespect to the origin O is defined as the vector\nproduct\n\nτττττ = r     × F (7.23)\nThe moment of force (or torque) is a vector\n\nquantity. The symbol τ τ τ τ τ stands for the Greek\nletter tau. The magnitude of τ τ τ τ τ is\n\nτ = r F sinθ (7.24a)\nwhere r is the magnitude of the position vector\nr, i.e. the length OP, F is the magnitude of force\nF and θ     is the angle between r and F as\nshown.\n\nMoment of force has dimensions M L2 T -2.\nIts dimensions are the same as those of work\nor energy. It is, however, a very different physical\nquantity than work. Moment of a force is a\nvector, while work is a scalar. The SI unit of\nmoment of force is newton metre (N m). The\nmagnitude of the moment of force may be\nwritten\n\n( sin )r F r Fτ θ ⊥= = (7.24b)\n\nor sinr F rFτ θ ⊥= = (7.24c)\n\nwhere r⊥  = r sinθ is the perpendicular distance\n\nof the line of action of F from the origin and\n( sin )F F θ⊥ = is the component of F in the\n\ndirection perpendicular to r. Note that τ = 0 if\nr = 0, F = 0 or θ = 00 or 1800 . Thus, the moment\nof a force vanishes if either the magnitude of\nthe force is zero, or if the line of action of the\nforce passes through the origin.\n\nOne may note that since  r × F is a vector\nproduct, properties of a vector product of two\nvectors apply to it. If the direction of F is\nreversed, the direction of the moment of force\nis reversed. If directions of both r and F are\nreversed, the direction of the moment of force\nremains the same.\n\n7.7.2 Angular momentum of a particle\n\nJust as the moment of a force is the rotational\nanalogue of force in linear motion, the quantity\nangular momentum is the rotational analogue\nof linear momentum. We shall first define\nangular momentum for the special case of a\nsingle particle and look at its usefulness in the\ncontext of single particle motion. We shall then\nextend the definition of angular momentum to\nsystems of particles including rigid bodies.\n\nLike moment of a force, angular momentum\nis also a vector product. It could also be referred\nto as moment of (linear) momentum. From this\nterm one could guess how angular momentum\nis defined.\n\nConsider a particle of mass m and linear\nmomentum p at a position r relative to the origin\nO. The angular momentum l of the particle with\nrespect to the origin O is defined to be\n\nl = r ×  ×  ×  ×  × p (7.25a)\nThe magnitude of the angular momentum\n\nvector is\n\nsinl r p= θ (7.26a)\nwhere p is the magnitude of p and θ is the angle\nbetween r and p. We may write\n\nl r p⊥=  or r p⊥                                   (7.26b)\n\nwhere r⊥  (= r sinθ) is the perpendicular distance\nof the directional line of  p from the origin and\n\n( sin )p p θ⊥ =  is the component of p in a direction\nperpendicular to r. We expect the angular\nmomentum to be zero (l = 0), if the linear\nmomentum vanishes (p = 0), if the particle is at\nthe origin (r = 0), or if the directional line of  p\npasses through the origin θ = 00 or 1800.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n156 PHYSICS\n\nThe physical quantities, moment of a force\nand angular momentum, have an important\nrelation between them. It is the rotational\nanalogue of the relation between force and linear\nmomentum. For deriving the relation in the\ncontext of a single particle, we differentiate\n\nl  = r × p with respect to time,\n\nd d\n( )\n\nd d\n= ×r p\n\nt t\n\nl\n\nApplying the product rule for differentiation\nto the right hand side,\n\nd d d\n( )\n\nd d dt t t\n× = × + ×\n\nr p\nr p p r\n\nNow, the velocity of the particle is v = dr/dt\nand p = m v\n\nBecause of this \nd\n\n0,\nd\n\nm\nt\n\n× = × =\nr\n\np v v\n\nas the vector product of two parallel vectors\nvanishes. Further, since dp / dt = F,\n\nr\np\n\nr F× = × =\nd\n\ndt\nττ\n\nHence \nd\n\ndt\n( )r p× = ττ\n\nor  (7.27)\n\nThus, the time rate of change of the angular\nmomentum of a particle is equal to the torque\nacting on it. This is the rotational analogue of\nthe equation F = dp/dt, which expresses\nNewton’s second law for the translational motion\nof a single particle.\n\nTorque and angular momentum for a system\nof particles\n\nTo get the total angular momentum of a system\nof particles about a given point we need to add\nvectorially the angular momenta of individual\nparticles. Thus, for a system of n particles,\n\nThe angular momentum of the ith   particle\nis given by\n\nl\ni\n = r\n\ni\n × p\n\ni\n\nwhere r\ni\n is the position vector of the ith particle\n\nwith respect to a given origin and p = (m\ni\nv\n\ni\n) is\n\nthe linear momentum of the particle. (The\n\nparticle has mass m\ni\n and velocity v\n\ni\n) We may\n\nwrite the total angular momentum of a system\nof particles as\n\n(7.25b)\n\nThis is a generalisation of the definition of\nangular momentum (Eq. 7.25a) for a single\nparticle to a system of particles.\n\nUsing Eqs. (7.23) and (7.25b), we get\n\nd\n\nd\n\nd\n\nd\n\nd\n\nd\n\nL\n\nt t t\ni i\n\nii\n\n= ( ) = = ∑∑∑∑l\nl\n\nτ (7.28a)\n\nAn experiment with the bicycle rim\n\nTake a\nbicycle rim\nand extend\nits axle on\nboth sides.\nTie two\ns t r i n g s\nat both ends\nA and B,\nas shown\nin the\na d j o i n i n g\nfigure.  Hold\nboth the\ns t r i n g s\ntogether in\n\none hand such that the rim is vertical. If you\nleave one string, the rim will tilt. Now keeping\nthe rim in vertical position with both the strings\nin one hand, put the wheel in fast rotation\naround the axle with the other hand. Then leave\none string, say B, from your hand, and observe\nwhat happens.\n\nThe rim keeps rotating in a vertical plane\nand the plane of rotation turns around the\nstring A which you are holding. We say that the\naxis of rotation of the rim or equivalently\nits angular momentum precesses about the\nstring A.\n\nThe rotating rim gives rise to an angular\nmomentum. Determine the direction of this\nangular momentum. When you are holding the\nrotating rim with string A, a torque is generated.\n(We leave it to you to find out how the torque is\ngenerated and what its direction is.) The effect\nof the torque on the angular momentum is to\nmake it precess around an axis perpendicular\nto both the angular momentum and the torque.\nVerify all these statements.\n\nInitially After\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROTATIONAL MOTION 157\n\n\uf075\n\n\uf075\n\nwhere τττττ\ni \nis the torque acting on the ith particle;\n\nττi i i= ×r F\nThe force F\n\ni \non the ith particle is the vector\n\nsum of external forces Fi\next  acting on the particle\n\nand the internal forces int\niF  exerted on it by the\n\nother particles of the system. We may therefore\nseparate the contribution of the external and\nthe internal forces to the total torque\n\nττ ττ= = ×∑ ∑i\ni\n\ni\n\ni\n\ni\nr F\n\n as\n\nττ ττ ττ= +ext int ,\n\nwhere   \nττext i i\n\next\n\ni\n\n= ×∑ r F\n\nand\nττint\n\nint= ×∑ r Fi i\ni\n\nWe shall assume not only Newton’s third law\n\nof motion, i.e. the forces between any two particles\n\nof the system are equal and opposite, but also that\n\nthese forces are directed along the line joining the\n\ntwo particles. In this case the contribution of the\n\ninternal forces to the total torque on the system is\n\nzero, since the torque resulting from each action-\n\nreaction pair of forces is zero. We thus have, τττττ\nint\n\n =\n\n0 and therefore τττττ\n \n = τ τ τ τ τ\n\next\n.\n\nSince ττ ττ= ∑ i , it follows from Eq. (7.28a)\nthat\n\nd\n\nd\n\nL\n\nt\next= ττ (7.28 b)\n\nThus, the time rate of the total angular\n\nmomentum of a system of particles about a\n\npoint (taken as the origin of our frame of\n\nreference) is equal to the sum of the external\n\ntorques (i.e. the torques due to external forces)\n\nacting on the system taken about the same\n\npoint. Eq. (7.28 b) is the generalisation of the\n\nsingle particle case of Eq. (7.23) to a system of\n\nparticles. Note that when we have only one\n\nparticle, there are no internal forces or torques.\n\nEq.(7.28 b) is the rotational analogue of\n\nd\n\nd\n\nP\nF\n\nt\next= (7.17)\n\nNote that like Eq.(7.17), Eq.(7.28b) holds\n\ngood for any system of particles, whether it is a\n\nrigid body or its individual particles have all\n\nkinds of internal motion.\n\nConservation of angular momentum\n\nIf τττττ\next \n\n= 0, Eq. (7.28b) reduces to\n\nd\n0\n\ndt\n=\n\nL\n\nor         L = constant. (7.29a)\nThus, if the total external torque on a system\n\nof particles is zero, then the total angular\nmomentum of the system is conserved, i.e.\nremains constant. Eq. (7.29a) is equivalent to\nthree scalar equations,\n\nL\nx\n = K\n\n1\n, L\n\ny\n = K\n\n2\n and L\n\nz\n = K\n\n3\n(7.29 b)\n\nHere K\n1\n, K\n\n2\n and K\n\n3\n are constants; L\n\nx\n, L\n\ny\n and\n\nL\nz\n are the components of the total angular\n\nmomentum vector L along the x,y and z axes\nrespectively. The statement that the total\nangular momentum is conserved means that\neach of these three components is conserved.\n\nEq. (7.29a) is the rotational analogue of\nEq. (7.18a), i.e. the conservation law of the total\nlinear momentum for a system of  particles.\nLike Eq. (7.18a), it has applications in many\npractical situations. We shall look at a few of\nthe interesting applications later on in this\nchapter.\n\nExample 7.5  Find the torque of a force\n7î  + 3ĵ  – 5k̂  about the origin.

We want to calculate\nthe angular momentum of the particle about an\narbitrary point O.\n\nFig 7.19\n\nThe angular momentum is l = r × mv. Its\nmagnitude is mvr sinθ, where θ is the angle\nbetween r and v as shown in Fig. 7.19. Although\nthe particle changes position with time, the line\nof direction of v remains the same and hence\nOM = r sin θ. is a constant.\n\nFurther, the direction of l is perpendicular\nto the plane of r and v. It is into the page of the\nfigure.This direction does not change with time.\n\nThus, l remains the same in magnitude and\ndirection and is therefore conserved. Is there\nany external torque on the particle? \uf074\n\n7.8  EQUILIBRIUM OF A RIGID BODY\n\nWe are now going to concentrate on the motion\nof rigid bodies rather than on the motion of\ngeneral systems of particles.\n\nWe shall recapitulate what effect the\nexternal forces have on a rigid body. (Henceforth\nwe shall omit the adjective ‘external’ because\nunless stated otherwise, we shall deal with only\nexternal forces and torques.) The forces change\nthe translational state of the motion of the rigid\nbody, i.e. they change its total linear momentum\nin accordance with Eq. (7.17). But this is not\nthe only effect the forces have. The total torque\non the body may not vanish. Such a torque\nchanges the rotational state of motion of the\nrigid body, i.e. it changes the total angular\nmomentum of the body in accordance with Eq.\n(7.28 b).\n\nA rigid body is said to be in mechanical\nequilibrium, if both its linear momentum and\nangular momentum are not changing with time,\nor equivalently, the body has neither linear\n\nacceleration nor angular acceleration. This\nmeans\n(1) the total force, i.e. the vector sum of the\n\nforces, on the rigid body is zero;\n\nF F F F1 2\n1\n\n+ + + = =\n=\n∑... n i\ni\n\nn\n\n0 (7.30a)\n\nIf the total force on the body is zero, then\nthe total linear momentum of the body does\nnot change with time. Eq. (7.30a) gives the\ncondition for the translational equilibrium\nof the body.\n\n(2) The total torque, i.e. the vector sum of the\ntorques on the rigid body is zero,\n\nττ ττ ττ ττ1 2\n\n1\n\n+ + + = =\n=\n∑... n i\ni\n\nn\n\n0 (7.30b)\n\nIf the total torque on the rigid body is zero,\n\nthe total angular momentum of the body does\n\nnot change with time. Eq. (7.30 b) gives the\n\ncondition for the rotational equilibrium of the\n\nbody.\n\nOne may raise a question, whether the\n\nrotational equilibrium condition [Eq. 7.30(b)]\n\nremains valid, if the origin with respect to which\n\nthe torques are taken is shifted. One can show\n\nthat if the translational equilibrium condition\n\n[Eq. 7.30(a)] holds for a rigid body, then such a\n\nshift of origin does not matter, i.e. the rotational\n\nequilibrium condition is independent of the\n\nlocation of the origin about which the torques\n\nare taken. Example 7.7 gives a proof of this\n\nresult in a special case of a couple, i.e. two forces\n\nacting on a rigid body in translational\n\nequilibrium. The generalisation of this result to\n\nn forces is left as an exercise.\n\nEq. (7.30a) and Eq. (7.30b), both, are vector\n\nequations. They are equivalent to three scalar\n\nequations each. Eq. (7.30a) corresponds to\n\nFix\ni\n\nn\n\n=\n=\n∑ 0\n\n1\n, Fiy\n\ni\n\nn\n\n=\n=\n∑ 0\n\n1\n and Fiz\n\ni\n\nn\n\n=\n=\n∑ 0\n\n1\n  (7.31a)\n\nwhere F\nix\n, F\n\niy\n and F\n\niz\n are respectively the x, y\n\nand z components of the forces F\ni\n. Similarly,\n\nEq. (7.30b) is equivalent to three scalar\nequations\n\nτ\nix\n\ni\n\nn\n\n=\n=\n∑ 0\n\n1\n, τiy\n\ni\n\nn\n\n=\n=\n∑ 0\n\n1\n and τiz\n\ni\n\nn\n\n=\n=\n∑ 0\n\n1\n  (7.31b)\n\nwhere τ\nix\n, τ\n\niy\n  and  τ\n\niz \nare respectively the x, y and\n\nz components of the torque τττττ\ni\n .\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROTATIONAL MOTION 159\n\nEq. (7.31a) and (7.31b) give six independent\nconditions to be satisfied for mechanical\nequilibrium of a rigid body. In a number of\nproblems all the forces acting on the body are\ncoplanar. Then we need only three conditions\nto be satisfied for mechanical equilibrium. Two\nof these conditions correspond to translational\nequilibrium; the sum of the components of the\nforces along any two perpendicular axes in the\nplane must be zero. The third condition\ncorresponds to rotational equilibrium. The sum\nof the components of the torques along any axis\nperpendicular to the plane of the forces must\nbe zero.\n\nThe conditions of equilibrium of a rigid body\nmay be compared with those for a particle,\nwhich we considered in earlier chapters. Since\nconsideration of rotational motion does not\napply to a particle, only the conditions for\ntranslational equilibrium (Eq. 7.30 a) apply to\na particle. Thus, for equilibrium of a particle\nthe vector sum of all the forces on it must be\nzero. Since all these forces act on the single\nparticle, they must be concurrent. Equilibrium\nunder concurrent forces was discussed in the\nearlier chapters.\n\nA body may be in partial equilibrium, i.e., it\nmay be in translational equilibrium and not in\nrotational equilibrium, or it may be in rotational\nequilibrium and not in translational\nequilibrium.\n\nConsider a light (i.e. of negligible mass) rod\n(AB) as shown in Fig. 7.20(a). At the two ends (A\nand B) of which two parallel forces, both  equal\nin magnitude and acting along same direction\nare applied perpendicular to the rod.\n\nFig. 7.20 (a)\n\nLet C be the midpoint of AB, CA = CB = a.\nthe moment of the forces at A and B will both\nbe equal in magnitude (aF ), but opposite in\nsense as shown. The net moment on the rod will\nbe zero. The system will be in rotational\nequilibrium, but it will not be in translational\n\nequilibrium; F 0≠∑\n\nFig. 7.20 (b)\n\nThe force at B in Fig. 7.20(a) is reversed in\nFig. 7.20(b). Thus, we have the same rod with\ntwo forces of equal magnitude but acting in\nopposite diretions applied perpendicular to the\nrod, one at end A and the other at end B. Here\nthe moments of both the forces are equal, but\nthey are not opposite; they act in the same sense\nand cause anticlockwise rotation of the rod.  The\ntotal force on the body is zero; so the body is in\ntranslational equilibrium; but it is not in\nrotational equilibrium. Although the rod is not\nfixed in any way, it undergoes pure rotation (i.e.\nrotation without translation).\n\nA pair of forces of equal magnitude but acting\nin opposite directions with different lines of\naction is known as a couple or torque. A couple\nproduces rotation without translation.\n\nWhen we open the lid of a bottle by turning\nit, our fingers are applying a couple to the lid\n[Fig. 7.21(a)]. Another known example is a\ncompass needle in the earth’s magnetic field as\nshown in the Fig. 7.21(b). The earth’s magnetic\nfield exerts equal forces on the north and south\npoles. The force on the North Pole is towards\nthe north, and the force on the South Pole is\ntoward the south. Except when the needle points\nin the north-south direction; the two forces do\nnot have the same line of action. Thus there is\na couple acting on the needle due to the earth’s\nmagnetic field.\n\nFig. 7.21(a) Our fingers apply a couple to turn\nthe lid.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n160 PHYSICS\n\n\uf075\n\nFig. 7.21(b) The Earth’s magnetic field exerts equal\nand opposite forces on the poles of a\n\ncompass needle. These two  forces form\n\na couple.\n\nExample 7.7  Show that moment of a\ncouple does not depend on the point about\nwhich you take the moments.\n\nAnswer\n\nFig. 7.22\n\nConsider a couple as shown in Fig. 7.22\nacting on a rigid body. The forces F and -F act\nrespectively at points B and A. These points have\nposition vectors r\n\n1\n and r\n\n2\n with respect to origin\n\nO. Let us take the moments of the forces about\nthe origin.\n\nThe moment of the couple = sum of the\nmoments of the two forces making the couple\n\n= r\n1 \n× (–F) + r\n\n2 \n× F\n\n= r\n2 \n× F – r\n\n1 \n× F\n\n= (r\n2\n–r\n\n1\n)\n \n× F\n\nBut r\n1\n + AB = r\n\n2\n, and hence AB = r\n\n2\n – r\n\n1\n.\n\nThe moment of the couple, therefore, is\nAB\n\n \n× F.\nClearly this is independent of the origin, the\n\npoint about which we took the moments of the\nforces. \uf074\n\n7.8.1 Principle of moments\n\nAn ideal lever is essentially a light (i.e. of\nnegligible mass) rod pivoted at a point along its\n\nlength. This point is called the fulcrum. A see-\nsaw on the children’s playground is a typical\nexample of a lever. Two forces F\n\n1\n and F\n\n2\n, parallel\n\nto each other and usually perpendicular to the\nlever, as shown here, act on the lever at\ndistances d\n\n1\n and d\n\n2\n respectively from the\n\nfulcrum as shown in Fig. 7.23.\n\nFig. 7.23\n\nThe lever is a system in mechanical\nequilibrium. Let R be the reaction of the support\nat the fulcrum; R is directed opposite to the\nforces  F\n\n1\n and F\n\n2\n. For translational equilibrium,\n\nR – F\n1 \n– F\n\n2\n = 0 (i)\n\nFor considering rotational equilibrium we\ntake the moments about the fulcrum; the sum\nof moments must be zero,\n\nd\n1\nF\n\n1 \n– d\n\n2\nF\n\n2\n = 0 (ii)\n\nNormally the anticlockwise (clockwise)\nmoments are taken to be positive (negative). Note\nR acts at the fulcrum itself and has zero moment\nabout the fulcrum.\n\nIn the case of the lever force F\n1 \nis usually\n\nsome weight to be lifted. It is called the load\nand its distance from the fulcrum d\n\n1\n is called\n\nthe load arm. Force F\n2\n is the effort applied to lift\n\nthe load; distance d\n2\n of the effort from the\n\nfulcrum is the effort arm.\nEq. (ii) can be written as\nd\n\n1\nF\n\n1 \n=\n\n \nd\n\n2 \nF\n\n2\n(7.32a)\n\nor load arm\n \n× load = effort arm\n\n \n× effort\n\nThe above equation expresses the principle\nof moments for a lever. Incidentally the ratio\nF\n\n1\n/F\n\n2 \nis called the Mechanical Advantage (M.A.);\n\nM.A. =\n1 2\n\n2 1\n\nF d\n\nF d\n= (7.32b)\n\nIf the effort arm d\n2 \nis larger than the load\n\narm, the mechanical advantage is greater than\none. Mechanical advantage greater than one\nmeans that a small effort can be used to lift a\nlarge load. There are several examples of a lever\naround you besides the see-saw. The beam of a\nbalance is a lever. Try to find more such\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROTATIONAL MOTION 161\n\nexamples and identify the fulcrum, the effort and\neffort arm, and the load and the load arm of the\nlever in each case.\n\nYou may easily show that the principle of\nmoment holds even when the parallel forces  F\n\n1\n\nand F\n2 \nare not perpendicular, but act at some\n\nangle, to the lever.\n\n7.8.2 Centre of gravity\n\nMany of you may have the experience of\nbalancing your notebook on the tip of a finger.\nFigure 7.24 illustrates a similar experiment that\nyou can easily perform. Take an irregular-\nshaped cardboard having mass M and a narrow\ntipped object like a pencil. You can locate by trial\nand error a point G on the cardboard where it\ncan be balanced on the tip of the pencil. (The\ncardboard remains horizontal in this position.)\nThis point of balance is the centre of gravity (CG)\nof the cardboard. The tip of the pencil provides\na vertically upward force due to which the\ncardboard is in mechanical equilibrium. As\nshown in the Fig. 7.24, the reaction of the tip is\nequal and opposite to Mg and hence the\ncardboard is in translational equilibrium. It is\nalso in rotational equilibrium; if it were not so,\ndue to the unbalanced torque it would tilt and\nfall. There are torques on the card board due to\nthe forces of gravity like m\n\n1\ng, m\n\n2\ng ….  etc, acting\n\non the individual particles that make up the\ncardboard.\n\nFig. 7.24 Balancing a cardboard on the tip of a\npencil. The point of support, G, is the\n\ncentre of gravity.\n\nThe CG of the cardboard is so located that\nthe total torque on it due to the forces m\n\n1\ng, m\n\n2\ng\n\n….  etc. is zero.\nIf  r\n\ni\n is the position vector of the ith particle\n\nof an extended body with respect to its CG, then\nthe torque about the CG, due to the force of\ngravity on the particle  is τττττ\n\ni \n= r\n\ni\n × m\n\ni \ng. The total\n\ngravitational torque about the CG is zero, i.e.\n\nττ ττg i i i\nm= = × =∑ ∑ r g 0 (7.33)\n\nWe may therefore, define the CG of a body\nas that point where the total gravitational torque\non the body is zero.\n\nWe notice that in Eq. (7.33), g is the same\nfor all particles, and hence it comes out of the\nsummation. This gives, since g is non-zero,\n\n∑mi ir  = 0. Remember that the position vectors\n(r\n\ni\n) are taken with respect to the CG. Now, in\n\naccordance with the reasoning given below\nEq. (7.4a) in Sec. 7.2, if the sum is zero, the origin\nmust be the centre of mass of the body. Thus,\nthe centre of gravity of the body coincides with\nthe centre of mass in uniform gravity or gravity-\nfree space. We note that this is true because\nthe body being small,  g does not\n\nFig. 7.25 Determining the centre of gravity of a body\nof irregular shape. The centre of gravity G\n\nlies on the vertical AA\n1\n through the point\n\nof suspension of the body A.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n162 PHYSICS\n\n\uf075\n\n\uf075\n\nvary from one point of the body to the other. If\nthe body is so extended that g varies from part\nto part of the body, then the centre of gravity\nand centre of mass will not coincide. Basically,\nthe two are different concepts. The centre of\nmass has nothing to do with gravity. It depends\nonly on the distribution of mass of the body.\n\nIn Sec. 7.2 we found out the position of the\ncentre of mass of several regular, homogeneous\nobjects. Obviously the method used there gives\nus also the centre of gravity of these bodies, if\nthey are small enough.\n\nFigure 7.25 illustrates another way of\ndetermining the CG of an irregular shaped body\nlike a cardboard. If you suspend the body from\nsome point like A, the vertical line through A\npasses through the CG. We mark the vertical\nAA\n\n1\n. We then suspend the body through other\n\npoints like B and C. The intersection of the\nverticals gives the CG. Explain why the method\nworks. Since the body is small enough, the\nmethod allows us to determine also its centre\nof mass.\n\nExample 7.8   A metal bar 70 cm long\nand 4.00 kg in mass supported on two\nknife-edges placed 10 cm from each end.\nA 6.00 kg load is suspended at 30 cm from\none end.

The rod is uniform in cross\nsection and homogeneous; hence G is at the\ncentre of the rod; AB = 70 cm. AG = 35 cm, AP\n= 30 cm, PG = 5 cm, AK\n\n1\n= BK\n\n2 \n= 10 cm and K\n\n1\nG\n\n= K\n2\nG = 25 cm. Also, W= weight of the rod =\n\n4.00 kg and W\n1\n= suspended load = 6.00 kg;\n\nR\n1\n and R\n\n2\n are the normal reactions of the\n\nsupport at the knife edges.\nFor translational equilibrium of the rod,\nR\n\n1\n+R\n\n2 \n–W\n\n1 \n–W = 0 (i)\n\nNote W\n1\n and W act vertically down and R\n\n1\n\nand R\n2 \nact vertically up.\n\nFor considering rotational equilibrium, we\ntake moments of the forces. A convenient point\nto take moments about is G. The moments of\nR\n\n2\n and W\n\n1\n are anticlockwise (+ve), whereas the\n\nmoment of R\n1\n is clockwise (-ve).\n\nFor rotational equilibrium,\n–R\n\n1 \n(K\n\n1\nG) + W\n\n1 \n(PG) + R\n\n2 \n(K\n\n2\nG) = 0 (ii)\n\nIt is given that W = 4.00g N and W\n1\n = 6.00g\n\nN, where g = acceleration due to gravity. We\ntake g = 9.8 m/s2.\n\nWith numerical values inserted, from (i)\n\nR\n1 \n+ R\n\n2\n – 4.00g – 6.00g = 0\n\nor R\n1 \n+ R\n\n2\n = 10.00g  N (iii)\n\n               = 98.00 N\nFrom (ii), – 0.25 R\n\n1\n + 0.05 W\n\n1\n + 0.25 R\n\n2 \n= 0\n\nor R\n1\n – R\n\n2\n = 1.2g  N = 11.76 N (iv)\n\nFrom (iii) and (iv), R\n1\n = 54.88 N,\n\nR\n2\n = 43.12 N\n\nThus the reactions of the support are about\n55 N at K\n\n1 \nand 43 N at K\n\n2\n. \uf020\uf020\uf074\n\nExample 7.9  A 3m long ladder weighing\n20 kg leans on a frictionless wall.

We have yet to answer\n\none major question in this connection. What is\n\nthe analogue of mass in rotational motion?\n\nWe shall attempt to answer this question in the\n\npresent section. To keep the discussion simple,\n\nwe shall consider rotation about a fixed axis\n\nonly. Let us try to get an expression for the\n\nkinetic energy of a rotating body. We know\n\nthat for a body rotating about a fixed axis, each\n\nparticle of the body moves in a circle with linear\n\nvelocity given by Eq. (7.19). (Refer to Fig. 7.16).\n\nFor a particle at a distance from the axis, the\n\nlinear velocity is i irυ ω= . The kinetic energy of\nmotion of this particle is\n\n2 2 21 1\n\n2 2\ni i i i ik m m rυ ω= =\n\nwhere m\ni \nis the mass of the particle. The total\n\nkinetic energy K of the body is then given by\nthe sum of the kinetic energies of individual\nparticles,\n\n2 2\n\n1 1\n\n1\n( )\n\n2\n\nn n\n\ni i i\n\ni i\n\nK k m r ω\n= =\n\n= =\uf001 \uf001\nHere n is the number of particles in the body.\n\nNote ω is the same for all particles. Hence, taking\nω out of the sum,\n\n2 2\n\n1\n\n1\n( )\n\n2\n\nn\n\ni i\n\ni\n\nK m rω\n=\n\n= \uf001\n\nWe define a new parameter characterising\nthe rigid body, called the moment of inertia I ,\ngiven by\n\n2\n\n1\n\nn\n\ni i\n\ni\n\nI m r\n=\n\n=\uf001 (7.34)\nWith this definition,\n\n21\n\n2\nK Iω= (7.35)\n\nNote that the parameter I is independent of\nthe magnitude of the angular velocity. It is a\ncharacteristic of the rigid body and the axis\nabout which it rotates.\n\nCompare Eq. (7.35) for the kinetic energy of\na rotating body with the expression for the\nkinetic energy of a body in linear (translational)\nmotion,\n\n21\n\n2\nK m υ=\n\nHere, m is the mass of the body and v is its\nvelocity. We have already noted the analogy\nbetween angular velocity ω (in respect of rotational\nmotion about a fixed axis) and linear velocity v (in\nrespect of linear motion). It is then evident that\nthe parameter, moment of inertia I, is the desired\nrotational analogue of mass in linear motion. In\nrotation (about a fixed axis), the moment of inertia\nplays a similar role as mass does in linear motion.\n\nWe now apply the definition Eq. (7.34), to\ncalculate the moment of inertia in two simple\ncases.\n(a) Consider a thin ring of radius R and mass\n\nM, rotating in its own plane around its centre\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n164 PHYSICS\n\nwith angular velocity ω. Each mass element\nof the ring is at a distance R from the axis,\nand moves with a speed Rω.  The kinetic\nenergy is therefore,\n\n2 2 21 1\n\n2 2\nK M MRυ ω= =\n\nComparing with Eq. (7.35) we get I = MR 2\n\nfor the ring.\n\nFig. 7.28 A light rod of length l with a pair of masses\nrotating about an axis through the centre of\n\nmass of the system and perpendicular to\n\nthe rod. The total mass of the system is M.\n\n(b) Next, take a rigid rod of negligible mass of\nlength of length l with a pair of small masses,\nrotating about an axis through the centre of\nmass perpendicular to the rod (Fig. 7.28).\nEach mass M/2 is at a distance l/2 from the\naxis. The moment of inertia of the masses is\ntherefore given by\n\n(M/2) (l/2)2 + (M/2)(l/2)2\n\nThus, for the pair of masses, rotating about\nthe axis through the centre of mass\nperpendicular to the rod\n\nI = Ml2 / 4\nTable 7.1 simply gives the moment of inertia of\nvarious familiar regular shaped bodies about\nspecific axes. (The derivations of these\nexpressions are beyond the scope of this textbook\nand you will study them in higher classes.)\n\nAs the mass of a body resists a change in its\nstate of linear motion, it is a measure of its inertia\nin linear motion. Similarly, as the moment of\ninertia about a given axis of rotation resists a\nchange in its rotational motion, it can be\nregarded as a measure of rotational inertia of\nthe body; it is a measure of the way in which\ndifferent parts of the body are distributed at\ndifferent distances from the axis. Unlike the\nmass of a body, the moment of inertia is not a\nfixed quantity but depends on distribution of\nmass about the axis of rotation, and the\norientation and position of the axis of rotation\n\nwith respect to the body as a whole. As a\n\nmeasure of the way in which the mass of a\n\nrotating rigid body is distributed with respect to\n\nthe axis of rotation, we can define a new\n\nparameter, the radius of gyration. It is related\n\nto the moment of inertia and the total mass of\n\nthe body.\n\nNotice from the Table 7.1 that in all\n\ncases, we can write I = Mk2, where k has\n\nthe dimension of length. For a rod, about\n\nthe perpendicular axis at its midpoint,\n\ni.e.\n2 2\n\n12,k L=  = 12k L . Similarly, k = R/2\n\nfor the circular disc about its diameter. The\n\nlength k is a geometric property of the body and\n\naxis of rotation. It is called the radius of\n\ngyration. The radius of gyration of a body\n\nabout an axis may be defined as the distance\n\nfrom the axis of a mass point whose mass is\n\nequal to the mass of the whole body and whose\n\nmoment of inertia is equal to the moment of\n\ninertia of the body about the axis.\n\nThus, the moment of inertia of a rigid body\n\ndepends on the mass of the body, its shape and\n\nsize; distribution of mass about the axis of\n\nrotation, and the position and orientation of the\n\naxis of rotation.\n\nFrom the definition, Eq. (7.34), we can infer\n\nthat the dimensions of moments of inertia are\n\nML2 and its SI units are kg m2.\n\nThe property of this extremely important\n\nquantity I, as a measure of rotational inertia of\n\nthe body, has been put to a great practical use.\n\nThe machines, such as steam engine and the\n\nautomobile engine, etc., that produce rotational\n\nmotion have a disc with a large moment of\n\ninertia, called a flywheel. Because of its large\n\nmoment of inertia, the flywheel resists the\n\nsudden increase or decrease of the speed of the\n\nvehicle. It allows a gradual change in the speed\n\nand prevents jerky motions, thereby ensuring\n\na smooth ride for the passengers on the vehicle.\n\n7.10 THEOREMS OF PERPENDICULAR AND\nPARALLEL AXES\n\nThese are two useful theorems relating to\nmoment of inertia. We shall first discuss the\ntheorem of perpendicular axes and its simple\nyet instructive application in working out the\nmoments of inertia of some regular-shaped\nbodies.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROTATIONAL MOTION 165\n\nTable 7.1 Moments of inertia of some regular shaped bodies about specific axes\n\nZ Body Axis Figure I\n\n(1) Thin circular Perpendicular to M R 2\n\nring, radius R plane, at centre\n\n(2) Thin circular Diameter M R2/2\nring, radius R\n\n(3) Thin rod, Perpendicular to M L2/12\nlength  L rod, at mid point\n\n(4) Circular disc, Perpendicular to M R2/2\nradius R disc at centre\n\n(5) Circular disc, Diameter M R2/4\nradius R\n\n(6) Hollow cylinder, Axis of cylinder M R2\n\nradius R\n\n(7) Solid cylinder, Axis of cylinder M R2/2\nradius R\n\n(8) Solid sphere, Diameter 2 M R2/5\nradius R\n\nTheorem of perpendicular axes\n\nThis theorem is applicable to bodies which are\nplanar. In practice this means the theorem\n\napplies to flat bodies whose thickness is very\n\nsmall compared to their other dimensions (e.g.\n\nlength, breadth or radius). Fig. 7.29 illustrates\n\nthe theorem. It states that the moment of\ninertia of a planar body (lamina) about an axis\nperpendicular to its plane is equal to the sum\nof its moments of inertia about two\nperpendicular axes concurrent with\nperpendicular axis and lying in the plane of\nthe body.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n166 PHYSICS\n\n\uf075\n\nFig. 7.29 Theorem of perpendicular axes\napplicable to a planar body; x and y axes\n\nare two perpendicular axes in the plane\n\nand the z-axis is perpendicular to the\n\nplane.\n\nThe figure shows a planar body. An axis\nperpendicular to the body through a point O is\ntaken as the z-axis. Two mutually perpendicular\naxes lying in the plane of the body and\nconcurrent with z-axis, i.e., passing through O,\nare taken as the x and y-axes. The theorem\nstates that\n\nz x yI I I= + (7.36)\nLet us look at the usefulness of the theorem\n\nthrough an example.\n\nExample 7.10  What is the moment of\ninertia of a disc about one of its diameters?\n\nFig. 7.30 Moment of inertia of a disc about a\ndiameter, given its moment of inertia about\n\nthe perpendicular axis through its centre.\n\nAnswer  We assume the moment of inertia of\nthe disc about an axis perpendicular to it and\nthrough its centre to be known; it is MR2/2,\nwhere M is the mass of the disc and R is its\nradius (Table 7.1)\n\nThe disc can be considered to be a planar\nbody. Hence the theorem of perpendicular axes\nis applicable to it. As shown in Fig. 7.30, we\ntake three concurrent axes through the centre\nof the disc, O, as the x–, y– and z–axes; x– and\ny–axes lie in the plane of the disc and z–axis is\nperpendicular to it. By the theorem of\nperpendicular axes,\n\nz x yI I I= +\n\nNow, x and y axes are along two diameters\nof the disc, and by symmetry the moment of\ninertia of the disc is the same about any\ndiameter. Hence\n\nI\nx \n=\n\n \nI\ny\n\nand I\nz\n = 2I\n\nx\n\nBut I\nz\n = MR2/2\n\nSo finally, I\nx\n = I\n\nz\n/2 = MR2/4\n\nThus the moment of inertia of a disc about\nany of its diameter is MR2/4 . \uf020\uf020\uf074\n\nFind similarly the moment of inertia of a\nring about any of its diameters. Will the theorem\nbe applicable to a solid cylinder?\n\nFig.7.31 The theorem of parallel axes The z and z′\naxes are two parallel axes separated  by a\ndistance a; O is the centre of mass of the\n\nbody, OO’ = a.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROTATIONAL MOTION 167\n\n\uf075\n\n\uf075\n\n7.10.1 Theorem of parallel axes\n\nThis theorem is applicable to a body of any\nshape. It allows to find the moment of inertia of\na body about any axis, given the moment of\ninertia of the body about a parallel axis through\nthe centre of mass of the body. We shall only\nstate this theorem and not give its proof. We\nshall, however, apply it to a few simple situations\nwhich will be enough to convince us about the\nusefulness of the theorem. The theorem may\nbe stated as follows:\n\nThe moment of inertia of a body about any\naxis is equal to the sum of the moment of\ninertia of the body about a parallel axis passing\nthrough its centre of mass and the product of\nits mass and the square of the distance\nbetween the two parallel axes. As shown in\nthe Fig. 7.31, z and z′ are two parallel axes,\nseparated by a distance a. The z-axis passes\nthrough the centre of mass O of the rigid body.\nThen according to the theorem of parallel axes\n\nI\nz′\n\n = I\nz \n+ Ma2 (7.37)\n\nwhere I\nz\n  and  I\n\nz′\n are the moments of inertia of the\n\nbody about the z and z′ axes respectively, M is the\ntotal mass of the body and a is the perpendicular\ndistance between the two parallel axes.\n\nExample 7.11  What is the moment of\ninertia of a rod of mass M, length l about\nan axis perpendicular to it through one\nend?\n\nAnswer    For the rod of mass M and length l,\nI = Ml2/12.

For\n\nexample, the angular velocity ωωωωω plays the same\nrole in rotation as the linear velocity v in\ntranslation. We wish to take this analogy\n\nfurther. In doing so we shall restrict the\ndiscussion only to rotation about fixed axis. This\n\ncase of motion involves only one degree of\nfreedom, i.e., needs only one independent\nvariable to describe the motion. This in\n\ntranslation corresponds to linear motion. This\nsection is limited only to kinematics. We shall\n\nturn to dynamics in later sections.\n\nWe recall that for specifying the angular\ndisplacement of the rotating body we take any\nparticle like P (Fig.7.33) of the body. Its angular\ndisplacement θ in the plane it moves is the\nangular displacement of the whole body; θ is\nmeasured from a fixed direction in the plane of\n\nmotion of P, which we take to be the x′-axis,\nchosen parallel to the x-axis. Note, as shown,\nthe axis of rotation is the z – axis and the plane\nof the motion of the particle is the x - y plane.\nFig. 7.33 also shows θ\n\n0\n, the angular\n\ndisplacement at t = 0.\n\nWe also recall that the angular velocity is\nthe time rate of change of angular displacement,\nω = dθ/dt. Note since the axis of rotation is fixed,\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n168 PHYSICS\n\n\uf075\n\n\uf075\nthere is no need to treat angular velocity as a\n\nvector. Further, the angular acceleration, α =\ndω/dt.\n\nThe kinematical quantities in rotational\nmotion, angular displacement (θ), angular\nvelocity (ω) and angular acceleration (α)\nrespectively are analogous to kinematic\nquantities in linear motion, displacement (x ),\nvelocity (v) and acceleration (a). We know the\nkinematical equations of linear motion with\nuniform (i.e. constant) acceleration:\n\nv = v\n0\n + at (a)\n\n2\n0 0\n\n1\n\n2\nx x t atυ= + + (b)\n\n2 2\n0 2axυ υ= + (c)\n\nwhere x\n0\n = initial displacement and v\n\n0\n= initial\n\nvelocity. The word ‘initial’ refers to values of the\nquantities at t = 0\n\nThe corresponding kinematic equations for\nrotational motion with uniform angular\nacceleration are:\n\n0 t= +ω ω α (7.38)\n\n2\n0 0\n\n1\n\n2\nt t= + +θ θ ω α (7.39)\n\nand 2 2\n0 02 ( – )= +ω ω α θ θ (7.40)\n\nwhere θ\n0\n= initial angular displacement of the\n\nrotating body, and ω\n0 \n= initial angular velocity\n\nof the body.\n\nFig.7.33 Specifying the angular position of a rigid\n\nbody.\n\nExample 7.13  Obtain Eq. (7.38) from first\nprinciples.\n\nAnswer   The angular acceleration is uniform,\nhence\n\nd\n\nd\nconstant\n\nt\n\nω\nα= = (i)\n\nIntegrating this equation,\n\nω α= +∫ dt c\n   (as is constant)t cα α= +\nAt t = 0,  ω = ω\n\n0 \n(given)\n\nFrom (i) we get at t = 0, ω = c = ω\n0\n\nThus, ω = αt + ω\n0 \n as required.\n\nWith the definition of ω = dθ/dt we may\nintegrate Eq. (7.38) to get Eq. (7.39). This\nderivation and the derivation of Eq.

Also, we know that in rotational\nmotion moment of inertia and torque play the\nsame role as mass and force respectively in\nlinear motion. Given this we should be able to\nguess what the other analogues indicated in the\ntable are. For example, we know that in linear\nmotion, work done is given by F dx, in rotational\n\nmotion about a fixed axis it should be dτ θ ,\nsince we already know the correspondence\n\nd dx θ→  and F τ→ . It is, however, necessary\nthat these correspondences are established on\nsound dynamical considerations. This is what\nwe now turn to.\n\nBefore we begin, we note a simplification\nthat arises in the case of rotational motion\nabout a fixed axis. Since the axis is fixed, only\nthose components of torques, which are along\nthe direction of the fixed axis need to be\nconsidered in our discussion. Only these\ncomponents can cause the body to rotate about\nthe axis. A component of the torque\nperpendicular to the axis of rotation will tend\nto turn the axis from its position. We specifically\nassume that there will arise necessary forces of\nconstraint to cancel the effect of the\nperpendicular components of the (external)\ntorques, so that the fixed position of the axis\nwill be maintained. The perpendicular\ncomponents of the torques, therefore need not\nbe taken into account. This means that for our\ncalculation of torques on a rigid body:\n\n(1) We need to consider only those forces that\nlie in planes perpendicular to the axis.\nForces which are parallel to the axis will\ngive torques perpendicular to the axis and\nneed not be taken into account.\n\n(2) We need to consider only those components\nof the position vectors which are\nperpendicular to the axis. Components of\nposition vectors along the axis will result in\ntorques perpendicular to the axis and need\nnot be taken into account.\n\nWork done by a torque\n\nFig. 7.34 Work done by a force F\n1 \nacting on a particle\n\nof a body rotating about a fixed axis; the\n\nparticle describes a circular path with\n\ncentre C on the axis;  arc P\n1\nP′\n\n1\n(ds\n\n1\n) gives\n\nthe displacement of the particle.\n\nFigure 7.34 shows a cross-section of a rigid\nbody rotating about a fixed axis, which is taken\nas the z-axis (perpendicular to the plane of the\npage; see Fig. 7.33). As said above we need to\nconsider only those forces which lie in planes\nperpendicular to the axis. Let F\n\n1\n be one such\n\ntypical force acting as shown on a particle of\nthe body at point P\n\n1\n with its line of action in a\n\nplane perpendicular to the axis. For convenience\nwe call  this to be the x′–y′ plane (coincident\nwith the plane of the page). The particle at P\n\n1\n\ndescribes a circular path of radius r\n1\n with centre\n\nC on the axis; CP\n1\n = r\n\n1\n.\n\nIn time ∆t, the point moves to the position\nP\n\n1\n′. The displacement of the particle ds\n\n1\n,\n\ntherefore, has magnitude ds\n1\n = r\n\n1\ndθ and\n\ndirection tangential at P\n1\n to the circular path\n\nas shown. Here dθ is the angular displacement\nof the particle, dθ = 1 1P CP∠ ′ .The work done by\nthe force on the particle is\n\ndW\n1\n = F\n\n1\n. ds\n\n1\n= F\n\n1\nds\n\n1\n cosφ\n\n1\n= F\n\n1\n(r\n\n1 \ndθ)sinα\n\n1\n\nwhere φ\n1\n is the angle between F\n\n1\n and the tangent\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n170 PHYSICS\n\nat P\n1,\n and α\n\n1\n is the angle between  F\n\n1 \nand the\n\nradius vector OP\n1\n; φ\n\n1\n + α\n\n1\n = 90°.\n\nThe torque due to F\n1 \n\nabout the origin is\nOP\n\n1 \n× F\n\n1\n. Now OP\n\n1\n = OC + OP\n\n1\n. [Refer to\n\nFig. 7.17(b).] Since OC is along the axis, the\ntorque resulting from it is excluded from our\nconsideration. The effective torque due to F\n\n1\n is\n\nτττττ\n1\n= CP × F\n\n1\n; it is directed along the axis of rotation\n\nand has a magnitude τ\n1\n= r\n\n1\nF\n\n1 \nsinα , Therefore,\n\ndW\n1\n = τ\n\n1\ndθ\n\nIf there are more than one forces acting on\nthe body, the work done by all of them can be\nadded to give the total work done on the body.\nDenoting the magnitudes of the torques due to\nthe different forces as τ\n\n1\n, τ\n\n2\n, …  etc,\n\n1 2d ( ...)dW τ τ θ= + +\n\nRemember, the forces giving rise to the\ntorques act on different particles, but the\n\nangular displacement dθ is the same for all\nparticles. Since all the torques considered are\nparallel to the fixed axis, the magnitude τ of the\ntotal torque is just the algebraic sum of the\nmagnitudes of the torques, i.e., τ = τ\n\n1 \n+ τ\n\n2\n + .....\n\nWe, therefore, have\n\nd dW τ θ= (7.41)\n\nThis expression gives the work done by the\ntotal (external) torque τ which acts on the body\nrotating about a fixed axis. Its similarity with\nthe corresponding expression\n\ndW= F ds\nfor linear (translational) motion is obvious.\n\nDividing both sides of Eq. (7.41) by dt gives\n\nd d\n\nd d\n\nW\nP\n\nt t\n\nθ\nτ τω= = =\n\nor P τω= (7.42)\nThis is the instantaneous power. Compare\n\nthis expression for power in the case of\nrotational motion about a fixed axis with that of\npower in the case of linear motion,\n\nP = Fv\n\nIn a perfectly rigid body there is no internal\nmotion. The work done by external torques is\ntherefore, not dissipated and goes on to increase\nthe kinetic energy of the body. The rate at which\nwork is done on the body is given by Eq. (7.42).\nThis is to be equated to the rate at which kinetic\nenergy increases.

We already\nknow from there that the time rate of total\nangular momentum of a system of particles\nabout a point is equal to the total external torque\non the system taken about the same point. When\nthe total external torque is zero, the total angular\nmomentum of the system is conserved.\n\nWe now wish to study the angular momentum\nin the special case of rotation about a fixed axis.\nThe general expression for the total angular\nmomentum of the system of n particles is\n\nL r p= ×\n=\n∑ i i\ni\n\nN\n\n1\n(7.25b)\n\nWe first consider the angular momentum of\na typical particle of the rotating rigid body. We\nthen sum up the contributions of individual\nparticles to get L of the whole body.\n\nFor a typical particle l = r × p. As seen in the\nlast section r = OP = OC + CP [Fig. 7.17(b)]. With\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n172 PHYSICS\n\np = m v ,\n\n( ) ( )= × + ×OC v CP vm ml\nThe magnitude of the linear velocity v of the\nparticle at P is given by v = ωr\n\n⊥\n where r\n\n⊥\n is the\n\nlength of CP or the perpendicular distance of P\nfrom the axis of rotation. Further, v is tangential\nat P to the circle which the particle describes.\nUsing the right-hand rule one can check that\nCP × v is parallel to the fixed axis. The unit\nvector along the fixed axis (chosen as the z-axis)\n\nis k̂ . Hence\n\n( ) ˆ⊥× =CP v km r mv\n= 2 ˆ ω⊥ kmr (since υ = ωr⊥ )\nSimilarly, we can check that OC × v is\n\nperpendicular to the fixed axis. Let us denote\nthe part of  l along the fixed axis (i.e. the z-axis)\nby l\n\nz\n, then\n\n z = ×CP vml = \n2 ˆω⊥ kmr\n\nand = + ×OC vz ml l\nWe note that l\n\nz\n is parallel to the fixed axis,\n\nbut l is not. In general, for a particle, the angular\nmomentum l is not along the axis of rotation,\ni.e. for a particle, l and ωωωωω are not necessarily\nparallel. Compare this with the corresponding\nfact in translation. For a particle, p and v are\nalways parallel to each other.\n\nFor computing the total angular momentum\nof the whole rigid body, we add up the\ncontribution of each particle of the body.\n\nThus\n\nWe denote by ⊥L  and zL  the components of\n\nL  respectively perpendicular to the z-axis and\n\nalong the z-axis;\n\nL OC v⊥ = ×∑ i i im (7.44a)\nwhere m\n\ni\n and v\n\ni\n are respectively the mass and\n\nthe velocity of the ith particle and C\ni\n is the centre\n\nof the circle described by the particle;\n\nand\n\nor ˆω=L kz I (7.44b)\nThe last step follows since the perpendicular\n\ndistance of the ith particle from the axis is r\ni\n;\n\nand by definition the moment of inertia of the\n\nbody about the axis of rotation is I m ri i= ∑ 2 .\n\nNote z ⊥= +L L L (7.44c)\nThe rigid bodies which we have mainly\n\nconsidered in this chapter are symmetric about\nthe axis of rotation, i.e. the axis of rotation is\none of their symmetry axes. For such bodies,\nfor a given OC\n\ni\n, for every particle which has a\n\nvelocity v\ni\n , there is another particle of velocity\n\n–v\ni\n  located diametrically opposite on the circle\n\nwith centre C\ni\n described by the particle. Together\n\nsuch pairs will contribute zero to ⊥L  and as a\n\nresult for symmetric bodies ⊥L  is zero, and\n\nhence\n\nˆω= =L L kz I (7.44d)\nFor bodies, which are not symmetric about\n\nthe axis of rotation, L is not equal to L\nz\n and\n\nhence L does not lie along the axis of rotation.\nReferring to Table 7.1, can you tell in which\n\ncases L = L\nz \nwill not apply?\n\nLet us differentiate Eq. (7.44b). Since k̂ is a\n\nfixed (constant) vector, we get\n\nd\n\nd\n\nd\n\nd\nz\n\nt t\nIL k( ) = ( )\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\nω\nˆ\n\nNow, Eq. (7.28b) states\n\nd\n\ndt\n=\n\nL\nττττ\n\nAs we have seen in the last section, only\nthose components of the external torques which\nare along the axis of rotation, need to be taken\ninto account, when we discuss rotation about a\n\nfixed axis. This means we can take ˆτ= kττττ .\n\nSince z ⊥= +L L L  and the direction of Lz (vector\n\nk̂ ) is fixed, it follows that for rotation about a\n\nfixed axis,\n\nd ˆ\nd\n\nτ=\nL\n\nkz\nt\n\n(7.45a)\n\nand \nd\n\n0\ndt\n\n⊥ =\nL\n\n(7.45b)\n\nThus, for rotation about a fixed axis, the\ncomponent of angular momentum\nperpendicular to the fixed axis is constant. As\n\nˆω=L kz I , we get from Eq. (7.45a),\n\n( )\nd\n\nd\nI\n\nt\nω τ= (7.45c)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROTATIONAL MOTION 173\n\nIf the moment of inertia I does not change with\ntime,\n\n( )d d\nd d\n\nI I I\nt t\n\nω\nω α= =\n\nand we get from Eq. (7.45c),\n\nIτ α= (7.43)\nWe have already derived this equation using\n\nthe work - kinetic energy route.\n\n7.13.1 Conservation of angular momentum\n\nWe are now in a position to revisit the principle\nof conservation of angular momentum in the\ncontext of rotation about a fixed axis. From Eq.\n(7.45c), if the external torque is zero,\n\nL\nz\n = Iω = constant (7.46)\n\nFor symmetric bodies, from Eq. (7.44d), L\nz\n\nmay be replaced by L .(L and L\nz \n are respectively\n\nthe magnitudes of L and L\nz\n.)\n\nThis then is the required form, for fixed axis\nrotation, of Eq. (7.29a), which expresses the\ngeneral law of conservation of angular\nmomentum of a system of particles.  Eq. (7.46)\napplies to many situations that we come across\nin daily life.  You may do this experiment with\nyour friend.  Sit on a swivel chair (a chair with a\nseat, free to rotate about a pivot) with your arms\nfolded and feet not resting on, i.e., away from,\nthe ground.  Ask your friend to rotate the chair\nrapidly. While the chair is rotating with\n\nconsiderable angular speed stretch your arms\nhorizontally.  What happens?  Your angular\nspeed is reduced.  If you bring back your arms\ncloser to your body, the angular speed increases\nagain.  This is a situation where the principle of\nconservation of angular momentum is\napplicable.  If friction in the rotational\nmechanism is neglected, there is no external\ntorque about the axis of rotation of the chair\nand hence Iω is constant.  Stretching the arms\nincreases I about the axis of rotation, resulting\nin decreasing the angular speed ω.  Bringing\nthe arms closer to the body has the opposite\neffect.\n\nA circus acrobat and a diver take advantage\nof this principle.  Also, skaters and classical,\nIndian or western, dancers performing a\npirouette (a spinning about a tip–top) on the toes\nof one foot display ‘mastery’ over this principle.\nCan you explain?\n\n7.14  ROLLING MOTION\n\nOne of the most common motions observed in\ndaily life is the rolling motion.  All wheels used\nin transportation have rolling motion.  For\nspecificness we shall begin with the case of a\ndisc, but the result will apply to any rolling body\nrolling on a level surface.  We shall assume that\nthe disc rolls without slipping.  This means that\nat any instant of time the bottom of the disc\n\nFig 7.36 (a) A demonstration of conservation of\nangular momentum. A girl sits  on a\n\nswivel chair and stretches her arms/\n\nbrings her arms closer to the body.\n\nFig 7.36 (b) An acrobat employing the principle of\nconservation of angular momentum in\n\nher performance.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n174 PHYSICS\n\nwhich is in contact with the surface is at rest\non the surface.\n\nWe have remarked earlier that rolling motion\nis a combination of rotation and translation.  We\nknow that the translational motion of a system\nof particles is the motion of its centre of mass.\n\nFig. 7.37 The rolling motion (without slipping) of a\ndisc on a level surface. Note at any instant,\n\nthe point of contact P\n0\n of the disc with the\n\nsurface is at rest; the centre of mass of\n\nthe disc moves with velocity, v\ncm\n\n. The disc\n\nrotates with angular velocity ω about its\naxis which passes through C; v\n\ncm\n =Rω,\n\nwhere R is the radius of the disc.\n\nLet v\ncm\n\n be the velocity of the centre of mass\n\nand therefore the translational velocity of the\n\ndisc. Since the centre of mass of the rolling disc\n\nis at its geometric centre C (Fig. 7. 37), v\ncm \n\nis\n\nthe velocity of C.  It is parallel to the level\n\nsurface.  The rotational motion of the disc is\n\nabout its symmetry axis, which passes through\n\nC.  Thus, the velocity of any point of the disc,\n\nlike P\n0\n, P\n\n1\n or P\n\n2\n, consists of two parts, one is the\n\ntranslational velocity v\ncm \n\nand the other is the\n\nlinear velocity v\nr \non account of rotation. The\n\nmagnitude of  v\nr\n is v\n\nr \n= rω, where ω is the angular\n\nvelocity of the rotation of the disc about the axis\n\nand r is the distance of the point from the axis\n\n(i.e. from C).  The velocity v\nr \nis directed\n\nperpendicular to the radius vector of the given\n\npoint with respect to C.  In Fig. 7.37, the velocity\n\nof the point P\n2\n (v\n\n2\n) and its components \n\n \nv\n\nr \nand\n\nv\ncm \n\nare shown;  v\nr \nhere is perpendicular to CP\n\n2 \n.\n\nIt is easy to show that v\nz\n is perpendicular to the\n\nline P\nO\nP\n\n2\n. Therefore the line passing through P\n\nO\n\nand parallel to ωωωωω is called the instantaneous axis\nof rotation.\n\nAt P\no\n, the linear velocity, v\n\nr\n, due to rotation\n\nis directed exactly opposite to the translational\n\nvelocity v\ncm\n\n.\n \nFurther the magnitude of  v\n\nr \nhere is\n\nRω, where R is the radius of the disc. The\ncondition that P\n\no \nis instantaneously at rest\n\nrequires v\ncm  \n\n= Rω. Thus for the disc the condition\nfor rolling without slipping is\n\nυ ω\ncm\n\nR= (7.47)\nIncidentally, this means that the velocity of\n\npoint P\n1\n at the top of the disc (v\n\n1\n) has a\n\nmagnitude v\ncm\n\n+ Rω or 2 v\ncm \n\nand is directed\n\nparallel to the level surface. The condition (7.47)\n\napplies to all rolling bodies.\n\n7.14.1 Kinetic Energy of Rolling Motion\n\nOur next task will be to obtain an expression\nfor the kinetic energy of a rolling body. The\nkinetic energy of a rolling body can be separated\ninto kinetic energy of translation and kinetic\nenergy of rotation. This is a special case of a\ngeneral result for a system of particles,\naccording to which the kinetic energy of a\nsystem of particles (K) can be separated into\nthe kinetic energy of translational motion of the\ncentre of mass (MV2/2) and kinetic energy of\nrotational motion about the centre of mass of\nthe system of particles (K′). Thus,\n\n(7.48)\nWe assume  this general result (see Exercise\n\n7.31), and apply it to the case of rolling motion.\n\nIn our notation, the kinetic energy of the centre\nof mass, i.e., the kinetic energy of translation,\n\nof the rolling body is mv2\ncm\n\n /2, where m is the\nmass of the body and v\n\ncm\n is the centre of the\n\nmass velocity. Since the motion of the rolling\n\nbody about the centre of mass is rotation, K′\nrepresents the kinetic energy of rotation of the\n\nbody; , where I is the moment of\ninertia about the appropriate axis, which is the\n\nsymmetry axis of the rolling body. The kinetic\nenergy of  a rolling body, therefore, is given by\n\n(7.49a)\n\nSubstituting I = mk2 where k = the\ncorresponding radius of gyration of the body\nand v\n\ncm\n= R ω, we get\n\nor  (7.49b)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROTATIONAL MOTION 175\n\n\uf075\n\nEquation (7.49b) applies to any rolling body:\na disc, a cylinder, a ring or a sphere.\n\nExample 7.16  Three bodies, a ring, a solid\ncylinder and a solid sphere roll down the\nsame inclined plane without slipping.  They\nstart from rest.  The radii of the bodies are\nidentical.  Which of the bodies reaches the\nground with maximum velocity?\n\nAnswer  We assume conservation of energy of\nthe rolling body, i.e. there is no loss of energy\ndue to friction etc. The potential energy lost by\nthe body in rolling down the inclined plane\n(= mgh) must, therefore, be equal to kinetic\nenergy gained.  (See Fig.7.38) Since the bodies\nstart from rest the kinetic energy gained is equal\nto the final kinetic energy of the bodies.  From\n\nEq.

Which\nbody has the greatest rotational kinetic energy while\nreaching the bottom of the inclined plane? \uf074\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. Ideally, a rigid body is one for which the distances between different particles of the\nbody do not change, even though there are forces on them.\n\n2. A rigid body fixed at one point or along a line can have only rotational motion. A rigid\nbody not fixed in some way can have either pure translational motion or a combination\nof translational and rotational motions.\n\n3. In rotation about a fixed axis, every particle of the rigid body moves in a circle which\nlies in a plane perpendicular to the axis and has its centre on the axis. Every Point in\nthe rotating rigid body has the same angular velocity at any instant of time.\n\n4. In pure translation, every particle of the body moves with the same velocity at any\ninstant of time.\n\n5. Angular velocity is a vector. Its magnitude is ω = dθ/dt and it is directed along the axis\nof rotation. For rotation about a fixed axis, this vector ωωωωω has a fixed direction.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n176 PHYSICS\n\n6. The vector or cross product of two vector a and b is a vector written as a×b. The\nmagnitude of this vector is absinθ  and its direction is given by the right handed screw\nor the right hand rule.\n\n7. The linear velocity of a particle of a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis is given by\nv = ωωωωω × r, where r is the position vector of the particle with respect to an origin along\nthe fixed axis. The relation applies even to more general rotation of a rigid body with\none point fixed. In that case r is the position vector of the particle with respect to the\nfixed point taken as the origin.\n\n8. The centre of mass of a system of n particles is defined as the point whose position\nvector is\n\nR\nr\n\n=\n∑m\n\nM\n\ni i\n\n9. Velocity of the centre of mass of a system of particles is given by V = P/M, where P is the\nlinear momentum of the system. The centre of mass moves as if all the mass of the\nsystem is concentrated at this point and all the external forces act at it. If the total\nexternal force on the system is zero, then the total linear momentum of the system is\nconstant.\n\n10. The angular momentum of a system of n particles about the origin is\n\nL r p  \n  \n\n= ×\n=\n∑ i\n\ni\n\nn\n\ni\n\n1\n\nThe torque or moment of force on a system of n particles about the origin is\n\nττ = ×∑ r Fi i\n1\n\nThe force  F\ni  \nacting on the ith particle includes the external as well as internal forces.\n\nAssuming Newton’s third law of motion and that forces between any two particles act\nalong the line joining the particles, we can show τττττ\n\nint\n = 0 and\n\nd\n\ndt\next\n\nL\n= ττ\n\n11. A rigid body is in mechanical equilibrium if\n\n(1) it is in translational equilibrium, i.e., the total external force on it is zero : F 0i =∑ ,\nand\n\n(2) it is in rotational equilibrium, i.e. the total external torque on it is zero :\n\nττi i i= × =∑ ∑ r F 0 .\n12. The centre of gravity of an extended body is that point where the total gravitational\n\ntorque on the body is zero.\n\n13. The moment of intertia of a rigid body about an axis is defined by the formula  I m ri i= ∑ 2\nwhere r\n\ni\n is the perpendicular distance of the ith point of the body from the axis. The\n\nkinetic energy of rotation is \n21\n\n2\nK Iω= .\n\n14. The theorem of parallel axes: 2\nz zI I Ma′ = + , allows us to determine the moment of\n\nintertia of a rigid body about an axis as the sum of the moment of inertia of the body\nabout a parallel axis through its centre of mass and the product of mass and square of\nthe perpendicular distance between these two axes.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROTATIONAL MOTION 177\n\n15. Rotation about a fixed axis is directly analogous to linear motion in respect of kinematics\nand dynamics.\n\n16. For a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis (say, z-axis) of rotation, L\nz\n = Iω, where I is\n\nthe moment of inertia about z-axis. In general, the angular momentum L for such a\nbody is not along the axis of rotation. Only if the body is symmetric about the axis of\n\nrotation, L is along the axis of rotation. In that case, zL I= =L ω . The angular\nacceleration of a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis is given by Iα = τ. If the external\ntorque τ acting on the body is zero, the component of angular momentum about the\nfixed axis (say, z-axis), L\n\nz\n (=Iω) of such a rotating body is constant.\n\n17. For rolling motion without slipping v\ncm\n\n = Rω, where v\ncm\n\n  is the velocity of translation (i.e.\nof the centre of mass), R is the radius and m is the mass of the body. The kinetic energy\nof such a rolling body is the sum of kinetic energies of translation and rotation:\n\n2 21 1\n\n2 2\ncmK m v I= + ω .\n\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n\n1. To determine the motion of the centre of mass of a system no knowledge of internal\nforces of the system is required. For this purpose we need to know only the external\nforces on the body.\n\n2. Separating the motion of a system of particles as the motion of the centre of mass, (i.e.,\nthe translational motion of the system) and motion about (i.e. relative to) the centre of\nmass of the system is a useful technique in dynamics of a system of particles. One\nexample of this technique is separating the kinetic energy of a system of particles K as\nthe kinetic energy of the system about its centre of mass K′ and the kinetic energy of\nthe centre of mass MV2/2,\n\n      K = K′ + MV2/2\n3. Newton’s Second Law for finite sized bodies (or systems of particles) is based in  Newton’s\n\nSecond Law and also Newton’s Third Law for particles.\n4. To establish that the time rate of change of the total angular momentum of a system of\n\nparticles is the total external torque in the system, we need not only Newton’s second\nlaw for particles, but also Newton’s third law with the provision that the forces between\nany two particles act along the line joining the particles.\n\n5. The vanishing of the total external force and the vanishing of the total external torque\nare independent conditions. We can have one without the other. In a couple, total\nexternal force is zero, but total torque is non-zero.\n\n6. The total torque on a  system is independent of the origin if the total external force is\nzero.\n\n7. The centre of gravity of a body coincides with its centre of mass only if the gravitational\nfield does not vary from one part of the body to the other.\n\n8. The angular momentum L and the angular velocity ωωωωω are not necessarily parallel vectors.\nHowever, for the simpler situations discussed in this chapter when rotation is about a\nfixed axis which is an axis of symmetry of the rigid body, the relation L = Iωωωωω holds good,\nwhere I is the moment of the inertia of the body about the rotation axis.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n178 PHYSICS\n\nEXERCISES\n\n7.1 Give the location of the centre of mass of a (i) sphere, (ii) cylinder, (iii) ring, and (iv)\ncube, each of uniform mass density.

According to the new definition,\nPluto is no longer a planet. This means that the Solar System consists of\neight planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and\nNeptune. According to the IAU usage, the ‘planet’ and ‘other bodies’ in our\nSolar System, except satellites, are to be defined into three distinct categories\nof celestial objects in the following way:\n\n1. A ‘planet’ is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has\nsufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it\nassumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and (c) has\ncleared the neighbourhood around its orbit.\n\n2. A ‘dwarf planet’ is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun,\n(b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so\nthat it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, (c) has\nnot cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit, and (d) is not a satellite.\n\n3. All ‘other objects’, except satellites, orbiting the Sun, shall be referred to\ncollectively as ‘Small Solar-System Bodies’.\n\nUnlike other eight planets in the Solar System, Pluto’s orbital path overlaps\nwith ‘other objects’ and the planet Neptune. The ‘other objects’ currently\ninclude most of the Solar System asteroids, most of the Trans-Neptunian\nObjects (TNOs), comets, and other small bodies.\n\nPluto is a ‘dwarf planet’ by the above definition and is recognised as the\nprototype of a new category of Trans-Neptunian Objects.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 9.pmd\n\n\nCHAPTER NINE\n\nMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF SOLIDS\n\n9.1 INTRODUCTION\n\nIn Chapter 7, we studied the rotation of the bodies and then\nrealised that the motion of a body depends on how mass is\ndistributed within the body.  We restricted ourselves to simpler\nsituations of rigid bodies.  A rigid body generally means a\nhard solid object having a definite shape and size.  But in\nreality,  bodies can be stretched, compressed and bent. Even\nthe  appreciably  rigid  steel bar can be deformed when a\nsufficiently large external force is applied on it.  This means\nthat solid bodies are not perfectly rigid.\n\nA solid has  definite shape and size. In order to change (or\ndeform) the shape or size of a body, a force  is required. If\nyou stretch a helical spring by gently pulling its ends, the\nlength of the spring increases slightly. When you leave the\nends of the spring, it regains its original size and shape.  The\nproperty of a body, by virtue of  which  it tends to regain its\noriginal size and shape when the applied force is removed, is\nknown as elasticity and the deformation caused is known\nas elastic deformation. However, if you apply force to a lump\nof putty or mud, they have no gross tendency to regain their\nprevious shape, and they get permanently deformed. Such\nsubstances are called plastic and this property is called\nplasticity. Putty and mud are close to ideal plastics.\n\n The elastic behaviour of materials plays an important role\nin engineering design.  For example, while designing a\nbuilding, knowledge of elastic properties of materials like steel,\nconcrete etc. is essential.  The same is true in the design of\nbridges, automobiles, ropeways etc.  One could also ask  —\nCan we design an aeroplane which is very  light  but\nsufficiently  strong?  Can we design an artificial limb which\nis lighter but stronger?  Why does a railway track have a\nparticular shape  like I?  Why  is glass brittle while brass is\nnot?  Answers to such questions begin with the study of how\nrelatively  simple kinds of loads or forces act to deform\ndifferent solids bodies.  In this chapter, we  shall study the\n\n9.1 Introduction\n\n9.2 Elastic behaviour of solids\n\n9.3 Stress and strain\n\n9.4 Hooke’s law\n\n9.5 Stress-strain curve\n\n9.6 Elastic moduli\n\n9.7 Applications of elastic\nbehaviour of materials\n\nSummary\n\nPoints to ponder\n\nExercises\n\nAdditional exercises\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n236 PHYSICS\n\nelastic behaviour and mechanical properties of\nsolids which  would answer many such\nquestions.\n\n9.2  ELASTIC BEHAVIOUR OF SOLIDS\n\nWe know that in a solid, each atom or molecule\nis surrounded by neighbouring atoms or\nmolecules. These are bonded together by\ninteratomic or intermolecular forces and stay\nin a stable equilibrium position. When a solid is\ndeformed, the  atoms or molecules are displaced\nfrom their equilibrium positions causing a\nchange in the interatomic   (or intermolecular)\ndistances. When the deforming force is removed,\nthe interatomic forces tend to drive them back\nto their original positions. Thus the body regains\nits original shape and size.  The restoring\nmechanism can be visualised by taking a model\nof spring-ball system shown in the Fig. 9.1. Here\nthe balls represent atoms and springs represent\ninteratomic forces.\n\nFig. 9.1 Spring-ball model for the illustration of elastic\n\nbehaviour of solids.\n\nIf you try to displace any ball from its\nequilibrium position, the spring system tries to\nrestore the ball back to its original position. Thus\nelastic behaviour of  solids can be explained in\nterms of microscopic nature of the solid.  Robert\nHooke, an English  physicist  (1635 - 1703 A.D)\nperformed experiments on springs and found\nthat the elongation (change in the  length)\nproduced in a body is proportional to the applied\nforce or load.  In 1676, he presented his law of\n\nelasticity, now called Hooke’s  law.  We shall\nstudy about it in Section 9.4. This law, like\nBoyle’s law, is one of the earliest quantitative\nrelationships in science.  It is very important to\nknow the behaviour of the materials under\nvarious kinds of load from the context of\nengineering design.\n\n9.3  STRESS AND STRAIN\n\nWhen  forces are applied on a body in such a\n\nmanner that the body is still in static equilibrium,\nit is deformed to a small or large extent depending\n\nupon the nature of the material of the body and\nthe magnitude of the deforming force.  The\ndeformation may not be noticeable visually in\n\nmany materials but it is there.  When a body is\nsubjected to a deforming force, a restoring force\n\nis developed in the body.  This restoring force is\nequal in magnitude but opposite in direction to\n\nthe applied force. The restoring force per unit area\nis known as stress.  If F is the force applied normal\nto the cross–section and A  is the  area of cross\n\nsection of  the body,\nMagnitude of the stress = F/A (9.1)\nThe SI unit of stress is  N m–2 or pascal (Pa)\n\nand its dimensional formula is [ ML–1T–2 ].\nThere are three ways in which a solid may\n\nchange its dimensions when an external force\nacts on  it. These are shown in Fig. 9.2.  In\nFig.9.2(a), a cylinder is stretched by two equal\nforces applied normal to its cross-sectional area.\nThe restoring   force per unit area  in this case\nis called tensile stress. If the cylinder is\ncompressed under the action of applied forces,\nthe restoring force per unit area is known as\ncompressive stress. Tensile or compressive\nstress can also be termed as longitudinal stress.\n\nIn both the cases, there is a change in the\nlength of the cylinder. The change in the length\n∆L to the original length L of the body (cylinder\nin this case) is known as longitudinal strain.\n\nLongitudinal strain  \n∆\n\n=\nL\n\nL\n(9.2)\n\nHowever, if two equal and opposite  deforming\nforces are applied parallel to the cross-sectional\narea of the cylinder, as shown in Fig. 9.2(b),\nthere is relative displacement between the\nopposite faces of the cylinder.  The restoring force\nper unit area developed due to the applied\ntangential force is known as tangential or\nshearing stress.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF SOLIDS 237\n\nAs a result of applied tangential force, there\nis a relative displacement ∆x between opposite\nfaces of the cylinder as shown in the Fig. 9.2(b).\nThe strain so produced is known as shearing\nstrain and it is defined as the ratio of relative\ndisplacement of the faces ∆x  to the length of\nthe cylinder L.\n\nShearing strain \n∆\n\n=\nx\n\nL\n = tan θ (9.3)\n\nwhere θ is the angular displacement of the\ncylinder from the vertical (original position of\nthe cylinder). Usually  θ is very small, tan θ\nis nearly equal to angle θ, (if θ = 10°, for\nexample, there is only 1% difference between θ\nand tan θ).\n\nIt can also be visualised, when a book is\npressed with the hand and pushed horizontally,\nas shown in Fig. 9.2 (c).\n\nThus, shearing strain  = tan θ ≈ θ (9.4)\nIn Fig. 9.2 (d), a solid sphere placed in the\n\nfluid under high pressure is compressed\nuniformly on all sides. The force applied by the\nfluid acts in perpendicular direction at each\npoint of the surface and the body is said to be\nunder hydraulic compression. This leads to\ndecrease in its volume without any change of\nits geometrical shape.\n\nThe body develops internal restoring forces\nthat are equal and opposite to the forces applied\nby the fluid (the body restores its original shape\nand size when taken out from the fluid). The\ninternal restoring force per unit area in this case\n\nRobert Hooke\n(1635 – 1703 A.D.)\n\nRobert Hooke was born on July 18, 1635 in Freshwater, Isle of Wight. He was\none of the most brilliant and versatile seventeenth century English scientists.\nHe attended Oxford University but never graduated. Yet he was an extremely\ntalented inventor, instrument-maker and building designer. He assisted Robert\nBoyle in the construction of Boylean air pump. In 1662, he was appointed as\nCurator of Experiments to the newly founded Royal Society. In 1665, he became\nProfessor of Geometry in Gresham College where he carried out his astronomi-\ncal observations. He built a Gregorian reflecting telescope; discovered the fifth\nstar in the trapezium and an asterism in the constellation Orion; suggested that\nJupiter rotates on its axis; plotted detailed sketches of Mars which were later\nused in the 19th century to determine the planet’s rate of rotation; stated the\ninverse square law to describe planetary motion, which Newton modified later\netc. He was elected Fellow of Royal Society and also served as the Society’s\nSecretary from 1667 to 1682. In his series of observations presented in Micrographia, he suggested\nwave theory of light and first used the word ‘cell’ in a biological context as a result of his studies of cork.\n\nRobert Hooke is best known to physicists for his discovery of law of elasticity: Ut tensio, sic vis (This\nis a Latin expression and it means as the distortion, so the force). This law laid the basis for studies of\nstress and strain and for understanding the elastic materials.\n\n(a) (b) (c) (d)\n\nFig. 9.2 (a) A cylindrical body under tensile stress elongates by ∆L (b) Shearing stress on a cylinder deforming it by\nan angle θ (c) A body subjected to shearing stress (d) A solid body under a stress normal to the surface at\nevery point (hydraulic stress). The volumetric strain is ∆V/V, but there is no change in shape.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n238 PHYSICS\n\nis known as hydraulic stress and in magnitude\nis equal to the hydraulic pressure (applied force\nper unit area).\n\nThe strain produced by a hydraulic pressure\nis called volume strain and is defined as the\nratio of change in volume (∆V) to the original\nvolume (V ).\n\nVolume strain \n∆\n\n=\nV\n\nV\n(9.5)\n\nSince the strain is a ratio of change in\ndimension to the original dimension, it has no\nunits or dimensional formula.\n\n9.4  HOOKE’S LAW\n\nStress and strain take different forms in the\nsituations depicted in the Fig. (9.2). For small\ndeformations the stress and strain are\nproportional to each other. This is known as\nHooke’s law.\nThus,\n\nstress ∝ strain\nstress = k × strain (9.6)\n\nwhere k is the proportionality constant and is\nknown as modulus of elasticity.\n\nHooke’s law is an empirical law and is found\nto be valid for most materials. However, there\nare some materials which do not exhibit this\nlinear relationship.\n\n9.5  STRESS-STRAIN CURVE\n\nThe relation between the stress and the strain\nfor a given material under tensile stress can be\nfound experimentally. In a standard test of\ntensile properties, a test cylinder or a wire is\nstretched by an applied force. The fractional\nchange in length (the strain) and the applied\nforce needed to cause the strain are recorded.\nThe applied force is gradually increased in steps\nand the change in length is noted. A graph is\nplotted between the stress (which is equal in\nmagnitude to the applied force per unit area)\nand the strain produced. A typical graph for a\nmetal is shown in Fig. 9.3. Analogous graphs\nfor compression and shear stress may also be\nobtained. The stress-strain curves vary from\nmaterial to material. These curves help us to\nunderstand how a given material deforms with\nincreasing loads. From the graph, we can see\nthat in the region between O to A, the curve is\nlinear.  In this region, Hooke’s law is obeyed.\n\nThe body regains its original dimensions when\nthe applied force is removed. In this region, the\nsolid behaves as an elastic body.\n\nIn the region from A to B, stress and strain\nare not proportional. Nevertheless, the body still\nreturns to its original dimension when the load\nis removed. The point B in the curve is known\nas yield point (also known as elastic limit) and\nthe corresponding stress is known as yield\nstrength (σ\n\ny\n) of the material.\n\nIf the load is increased further, the stress\ndeveloped exceeds the yield strength and strain\nincreases rapidly even for a small change in the\nstress. The portion of the curve between B and\nD shows this. When the load is removed, say at\nsome point C between B and D, the body does\nnot regain its original dimension. In this case,\neven when the stress is zero, the strain is not\nzero. The material is said to have a permanent\nset. The deformation is said to be plastic\ndeformation. The point D on the graph is the\nultimate tensile strength (σ\n\nu\n) of the material.\n\nBeyond this point, additional strain is produced\neven by a reduced applied force and fracture\noccurs at point E. If the ultimate strength and\nfracture points D and E are close, the material\nis said to be brittle. If they are far apart, the\nmaterial is said to be ductile.\n\nAs stated earlier, the stress-strain behaviour\nvaries from material to material. For example,\nrubber can be pulled to several times its original\nlength and still returns to its original shape.\nFig. 9.4 shows stress-strain curve for the elastic\ntissue of aorta, present in the heart. Note that\nalthough elastic region is very large, the material\n\nFig. 9.3 A typical stress-strain curve for a metal.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF SOLIDS 239\n\ndoes not obey Hooke’s law over most of the\nregion. Secondly, there is no well defined plastic\nregion. Substances like tissue of aorta, rubber\netc. which can be stretched to cause large strains\nare called elastomers.\n\n9.6  ELASTIC MODULI\n\nThe proportional region within the elastic limit\nof the stress-strain curve (region OA in Fig. 9.3)\nis of great importance for structural and\nmanufacturing engineering designs. The ratio\nof stress and strain, called modulus of elasticity,\nis found to be a characteristic of the material.\n\n9.6.1  Young’s Modulus\n\nExperimental observation show that for a given\nmaterial, the magnitude of the strain produced\nis same whether the stress is tensile or\ncompressive. The ratio of tensile (or compressive)\nstress (σ) to the longitudinal strain (ε) is defined as\nYoung’s modulus and is denoted by the symbol Y.\n\nY =\nσ\n\nε\n(9.7)\n\nFrom Eqs. (9.1) and (9.2), we have\n\nY = (F/A)/(∆L/L)\n   = (F × L) /(A × ∆L) (9.8)\n\nSince strain is a dimensionless quantity, the\nunit of Young’s modulus is the same as that of\nstress i.e., N m–2 or Pascal (Pa). Table 9.1 gives\nthe values of Young’s moduli and yield strengths\nof some material.\n\nFrom the data given in Table 9.1, it is noticed\nthat for metals Young’s moduli are large.\nTherefore, these materials require a large force\nto produce small change in length. To increase\nthe length of a thin steel wire of 0.1 cm2 cross-\nsectional area by 0.1%, a force of 2000 N is\nrequired. The force required to produce the same\nstrain in aluminium, brass and copper wires\nhaving the same cross-sectional area are 690 N,\n900 N and 1100 N respectively. It means that\nsteel is more elastic than copper, brass and\naluminium. It is for this reason that steel is\n\nFig. 9.4 Stress-strain curve for the elastic tissue of\nAorta, the large tube (vessel) carrying blood\n\nfrom the heart.\n\nTable 9.1 Young’s moduli and yield strenghs of some material\n\n# Substance tested under compression\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n240 PHYSICS\n\nu\n\nu\n\npreferred in heavy-duty machines and in\nstructural designs. Wood, bone, concrete and\nglass have rather small Young’s moduli.\n\nExample 9.1  A structural steel rod  has a\nradius of 10 mm and a length of 1.0 m. A\n100 kN force stretches it along its length.\nCalculate (a) stress, (b) elongation, and (c)\nstrain on the rod. Young’s modulus, of\nstructural steel is 2.0 × 1011 N m-2.\n\nAnswer We assume that the rod is held by a\nclamp at one end, and the force F is applied at\nthe other end, parallel to the length of the rod.\nThen the stress on the rod is given by\n\nStress\nF\n\nA\n=  =\n\nF\n\nrπ\n2\n\n        \n=\n\n× ( )\n×\n\n−\n\n100 10 N\n\n3.14 10 m\n\n3\n\n2\n2\n\n         = 3.18 × 108 N m–2\n\nThe elongation,\n\n( )F/A L\nL\n\nY\n∆ =\n\n    = \n( ) ( )×\n\n×\n\n8 –2\n\n11 –2\n\n1m3.18 10 N m\n\n2 10 N m\n\n    = 1.59 × 10–3 m\n    = 1.59 mm\n\nThe strain is given by\nStrain   = ∆L/L\n            = (1.59 × 10–3 m)/(1m)\n             = 1.59 × 10–3\n\n             = 0.16 % t\n\nExample 9.2 A copper wire of length 2.2\nm and a steel wire of length 1.6 m, both of\ndiameter 3.0 mm, are connected end to end.\nWhen stretched by a load, the net\nelongation is found to be 0.70 mm. Obtain\nthe load applied.\n\nAnswer The copper and steel wires are under\na tensile stress because they have the same\ntension (equal to the load W) and the same area\nof cross-section A. From Eq. (9.7) we have stress\n= strain × Young’s modulus. Therefore\n\nW/A = Y\nc\n × (∆L\n\nc\n/L\n\nc\n) = Y\n\ns\n × (∆L\n\ns\n/L\n\ns\n)\n\nwhere the subscripts c  and s refer to copper\nand stainless steel respectively.

Each\nthighbone (femur) of this performer has a\nlength of 50 cm and an effective radius of\n2.0 cm.

(9.8), the compression in each\n\nthighbone (∆L) can be computed as\n\n∆L = [(F × L)/(Y × A)]\n= [(1078 × 0.5)/(9.4 × 109 × 1.26 × 10-3)]\n\n= 4.55 × 10-5 m or 4.55 × 10-3 cm.\n\nThis is a very small change! The fractional\n\ndecrease in the thighbone is ∆L/L = 0.000091\n\nor 0.0091%. t\n\n9.6.2 Determination of Young’s Modulus of\nthe Material of a Wire\n\nA typical experimental arrangement to determine\n\nthe Young’s modulus of a material of wire under\ntension is shown in Fig. 9.6. It consists of two\nlong straight wires of same length and equal\n\nradius suspended side by side from a fixed rigid\nsupport. The wire A (called the reference wire)\n\ncarries a millimetre main scale M and a pan to\nplace a weight. The wire B (called the\nexperimental wire) of uniform area of cross-\n\nsection also carries a pan in which known\nweights can be placed. A vernier scale V is\n\nattached to a pointer at the bottom of the\nexperimental wire B, and the main scale M is\n\nfixed to the reference wire A. The weights placed\nin the pan exert a downward force and stretch\nthe experimental wire under a tensile stress. The\n\nelongation of the wire (increase in length) is\nmeasured by the vernier arrangement. The\n\nreference wire is used to compensate for any\nchange in length that may occur due to change\nin room temperature, since any change in length\n\nof the reference wire due to temperature change\n\nwill be accompanied by an equal change in\nexperimental wire. (We shall study  these\ntemperature effects in detail in Chapter 11.)\n\nFig. 9.6 An arrangement for the determination of\n\nYoung’s modulus of the material of a wire.\n\nBoth the reference and experimental wires are\n\ngiven an initial small load to keep the wires\nstraight and the vernier reading is noted. Now\n\nthe experimental wire is gradually loaded with\n\nmore weights to bring it under a tensile stress\n\nand the vernier reading is noted again. The\n\ndifference between two vernier readings gives\n\nthe elongation produced in the wire. Let r and L\nbe the initial radius and length of the\n\nexperimental wire, respectively. Then the area\n\nof cross-section of the wire would be πr2. Let M\n\nbe the mass that produced an elongation ∆L in\n\nthe wire. Thus the applied force is equal to Mg,\n\nwhere g is the acceleration due to gravity. From\nEq. (9.8), the Young’s modulus of the material\n\nof the experimental wire is given by\n\nY\nσ\n\nε\n=  = 2 .\n\nMg L\n\nLrπ ∆\n\n= Mg × L/(πr2 × ∆L) (9.9)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n242 PHYSICS\n\nu\n\n9.6.3 Shear Modulus\n\nThe ratio of shearing stress to the corresponding\n\nshearing strain is called the shear modulus of\n\nthe material and is represented by G. It is also\n\ncalled the modulus of rigidity.\n\nG  = shearing stress (σ\ns\n)/shearing strain\n\nG  = (F/A)/(∆x/L)\n\n    = (F × L)/(A × ∆x) (9.10)\n\nSimilarly, from Eq. (9.4)\n\nG  = (F/A)/θ\n\n     = F/(A × θ) (9.11)\n\nThe shearing stress σ\ns\n can also be expressed as\n\nσ\ns  \n\n=  G  × θ (9.12)\n\nSI unit of shear modulus is N m–2 or Pa. The\n\nshear moduli of a few common materials are\n\ngiven in Table 9.2. It can be seen that shear\n\nmodulus (or modulus of rigidity) is generally less\n\nthan Young’s modulus (from Table 9.1). For most\n\nmaterials G ≈ Y/3.\n\nTable 9.2 Shear moduli (G) of some common\n\nmaterials\n\nMaterial G (109 Nm–2\n\nor GPa)\n\nAluminium 25\n\nBrass 36\n\nCopper 42\n\nGlass 23\n\nIron 70\n\nLead 5.6\n\nNickel 77\n\nSteel 84\n\nTungsten 150\n\nWood 10\n\n Example 9.4 A square lead slab of side 50\ncm and thickness 10 cm is subject to a\nshearing force (on its narrow face) of 9.0 ×\n104 N. The lower edge is riveted to the floor.\nHow much will the upper edge be displaced?\n\nAnswer  The lead slab is fixed and the force is\napplied parallel to the narrow face as shown in\nFig. 9.7. The area of the face parallel to which\nthis force is applied is\n\n A  = 50 cm × 10 cm\n\n                = 0.5 m × 0.1 m\n\n     = 0.05 m2\n\nTherefore, the stress applied is\n    = (9.4  × 104 N/0.05 m2)\n\n                         = 1.80 × 106 N.m–2\n\nFig. 9.7\n\nWe know that shearing strain = (∆x/L)= Stress /G.\n\nTherefore the displacement ∆x = (Stress × L)/G\n\n = (1.8 × 106 N m–2 × 0.5m)/(5.6 × 109 N m–2)\n\n = 1.6 × 10–4 m = 0.16 mm   t\n\n9.6.4  Bulk Modulus\n\nIn Section (9.3), we have seen that when a body\n\nis submerged in a fluid, it undergoes a hydraulic\n\nstress (equal in magnitude to the hydraulic\n\npressure). This leads to the decrease in the\n\nvolume of the body thus producing a strain called\n\nvolume strain [Eq. (9.5)]. The ratio of hydraulic\n\nstress to the corresponding hydraulic strain is\n\ncalled bulk modulus. It is denoted by symbol B.\n\nB = – p/(∆V/V) (9.13)\n\nThe negative sign indicates the fact that with\n\nan increase in pressure, a decrease in volume\n\noccurs. That is, if p is positive, ∆V is negative.\n\nThus for a system in equilibrium, the value of\n\nbulk modulus B is always positive. SI unit of\n\nbulk modulus is the same as that of pressure\n\ni.e., N m–2 or Pa. The bulk moduli of a few\n\ncommon materials are given in Table 9.3.\n\nThe reciprocal of the bulk modulus is called\n\ncompressibility and is denoted by k. It is defined\n\nas the fractional change in volume per unit\n\nincrease in pressure.\n\nk = (1/B) = – (1/∆p) × (∆V/V) (9.14)\n\nIt can be seen from the data given in Table\n\n9.3 that the bulk moduli for solids are much\n\nlarger than for liquids, which are again much\n\nlarger than the bulk modulus for gases (air).\n\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF SOLIDS 243\n\nu\n\nGases have large compressibilities, which vary\n\nwith pressure and temperature.

The molecules in liquids are also bound\n\nwith their neighbours but not as strong as in\n\nsolids. Molecules in gases are very poorly\n\ncoupled to their neighbours.\n\nTable 9.4 shows the various types of stress,\n\nstrain, elastic moduli, and the applicable state\n\nof matter at a glance.\n\nExample 9.5 The average depth of Indian\nOcean is about 3000 m.

The strain\nperpendicular to the applied force is called\nlateral strain. Simon Poisson pointed out that\nwithin the elastic limit, lateral strain is directly\nproportional to the longitudinal strain. The ratio\nof the lateral strain to the longitudinal strain in\na stretched wire is called Poisson’s ratio. If the\noriginal diameter of the wire is d and the\ncontraction of the diameter under stress is ∆d,\nthe lateral strain is ∆d/d. If the original length\nof the wire is L and the elongation under stress\nis ∆L, the longitudinal strain is ∆L/L. Poisson’s\nratio is then (∆d/d)/(∆L/L) or (∆d/∆L) × (L/d).\nPoisson’s ratio is a ratio of two strains; it is a\npure number and has no dimensions or units.\nIts value depends only on the nature of material.\nFor steels the value is between 0.28 and 0.30,\nand for aluminium alloys it is about 0.33.\n\n9.6.6 Elastic Potential Energy\nin a Stretched Wire\n\nWhen a wire is put under a tensile stress, work\nis done against the inter-atomic forces. This\nwork is stored in the wire in the form of elastic\npotential energy. When a wire of original length\nL and area of cross-section A is subjected to a\ndeforming force F along the length of the wire,\nlet the length of the wire be elongated by l. Then\nfrom Eq. (9.8), we have F = YA × (l/L). Here Y is\nthe Young’s modulus of the material of the wire.\nNow for a further elongation of infinitesimal\nsmall length dl, work done dW is F × dl or YAldl/\nL. Therefore, the amount of work done (W) in\nincreasing the length of the wire from L to L + l,\nthat is from l = 0 to l = l is\n\n      W = = ×∫\n0\n\n2\n\n2\n\nl YAl YA l\ndl\n\nL L\n\n      W = \n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\n× × ×\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ed \uf8f8\n\n2\n1\n\n2\n\nl\nY AL\n\nL\n\n= \n1\n\n2\n×  Young’s modulus × strain2 ×\n\n         volume of the wire\n\n= \n1\n\n2\n×  stress × strain × volume of the\n\n          wire\n\nThis work is stored in the wire in the form of\n\nelastic potential energy (U). Therefore the elastic\n\npotential energy per unit volume of the wire (u) is\n\n       u = \n1\n\n2\n× σ ε (9.15)\n\n9.7 APPLICATIONS OF ELASTIC\nBEHAVIOUR OF MATERIALS\n\nThe elastic behaviour of materials plays an\nimportant role in everyday life. All engineering\ndesigns require precise knowledge of the elastic\nbehaviour of materials. For example while\ndesigning a building, the structural design of\nthe columns, beams and supports require\nknowledge of strength of materials used. Have\nyou ever thought why the beams used in\nconstruction of bridges, as supports etc. have\na cross-section of the type I? Why does a heap\nof sand or a hill have a pyramidal shape?\nAnswers to these questions can be obtained\nfrom the study of structural engineering which\nis based on concepts developed here.\n\nCranes used for lifting and moving heavy\nloads from one place to another have a thick\nmetal rope to which the load is attached. The\nrope is pulled up using pulleys and motors.\nSuppose we want to make a crane, which has\na lifting capacity of 10 tonnes or metric tons (1\nmetric ton = 1000 kg). How thick should the\nsteel rope be? We obviously want that the load\ndoes not deform the rope permanently.\nTherefore, the extension should not exceed the\nelastic limit. From Table 9.1, we find that mild\nsteel has a yield strength (σ\n\ny\n) of about 300 ×\n\n106 N m–2. Thus, the area of cross-section (A)\nof the rope should at least be\n\nA ≥ W/σy  =  Mg/σy (9.16)\n\n=  (104 kg × 9.8 m s-2)/(300 × 106 N m-2)\n=  3.3 × 10-4 m2\n\ncorresponding to a radius of about 1 cm for\na rope of circular cross-section. Generally\na large margin of safety (of about a factor of\nten in the load) is provided. Thus a thicker\nrope of radius about 3 cm is recommended.\nA single wire of this radius would practically\nbe a rigid rod. So the ropes are always made\nof a number of thin wires braided together,\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF SOLIDS 245\n\nlike in pigtails, for ease in manufacture,\nflexibility and strength.\n\nA bridge has to be designed such that it can\nwithstand the load of the flowing traffic, the force\nof winds and its own weight. Similarly, in the\ndesign of buildings the use of beams and columns\nis very common. In both the cases, the\novercoming of the problem of bending of beam\nunder a load is of prime importance. The beam\nshould not bend too much or break. Let us\nconsider the case of a beam loaded at the centre\nand supported near its ends as shown in\nFig. 9.8.  A bar of length l, breadth b, and depth d\nwhen loaded at the centre by a load W sags by\nan amount given by\n\nδ = W l3/(4bd 3Y) (9.17)\n\nFig. 9.8 A beam supported at the ends and loaded\n\nat the centre.\n\nThis relation can be derived using what you\n\nhave already learnt and a little calculus. From\n\nEq. (9.16), we see that to reduce the bending\n\nfor a given load, one should use a material with\n\na large Young’s modulus Y. For a given material,\n\nincreasing the depth d rather than the breadth\n\nb is more effective in reducing the bending, since\n\nδ  is proportional to d -3 and only to b-1(of course\n\nthe length l of the span should be as small as\n\npossible). But on increasing the depth, unless\n\nthe load is exactly at the right place (difficult to\n\narrange in a bridge with moving traffic), the\n\ndeep bar  may bend as shown in Fig. 9.9(b). This\n\nis called buckling. To avoid this, a common\n\ncompromise is the cross-sectional shape shown\n\nin Fig. 9.9(c). This section provides a large load-\n\nbearing surface and enough depth to prevent\n\nbending. This shape reduces the weight of the\n\nbeam without sacrificing the strength and\n\nhence reduces the cost.\n\n(a) (b) (c)\n\nFig. 9.9 Different cross-sectional shapes of a beam.\n(a) Rectangular section of a bar;\n\n(b) A thin bar and how it can buckle;\n\n(c) Commonly used section for a load\n\nbearing bar.\n\nThe use of pillars or columns is also very\ncommon in buildings and bridges. A pillar with\nrounded ends as shown in Fig. 9.10(a) supports\nless load than that with a distributed shape at\nthe ends [Fig. 9.10(b)]. The precise design of a\nbridge or a building has to take into account\nthe conditions under which it will function, the\ncost and long period, reliability of usable\nmaterial, etc.\n\n                    (a)                         (b)\n\nFig. 9.10 Pillars or columns: (a) a pillar with rounded\n\nends, (b) Pillar with distributed ends.\n\nThe answer to the question why the maximum\nheight of a mountain on earth is ~10 km can\nalso be provided by considering the elastic\nproperties of rocks. A mountain base is not under\nuniform compression and this provides some\nshearing stress to the rocks under which they\ncan flow. The stress due to all the material on\nthe top should be less than the critical shearing\nstress at which the rocks flow.\n\nAt the bottom of a mountain of height h, the\nforce per unit area due to the weight of the\nmountain is hρg where ρ is the density of the\nmaterial of the mountain and g is the acceleration\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n246 PHYSICS\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. Stress is the restoring force per unit area and strain is the fractional change in dimension.\nIn general there are three types of stresses (a) tensile stress — longitudinal stress\n(associated with stretching) or compressive stress (associated with compression),\n(b) shearing stress, and (c) hydraulic stress.\n\n2. For small deformations, stress is directly proportional to the strain for many materials.\nThis is known as Hooke’s law. The constant of proportionality is called modulus of\nelasticity. Three elastic moduli viz., Young’s modulus, shear modulus and bulk modulus\nare used to describe the elastic behaviour of objects as they respond to deforming forces\nthat act on them.\nA class of solids called elastomers does not obey Hooke’s law.\n\n3. When an object is under tension or compression, the Hooke’s law takes the form\n F/A  = Y∆L/L\n\nwhere  ∆L/L is the tensile or compressive strain of the object, F is the magnitude of the\napplied force causing the strain, A is the cross-sectional area over which F is applied\n(perpendicular to A) and Y is the Young’s modulus for the object. The stress is F/A.\n\n4. A pair of forces when applied parallel to the upper and lower faces, the solid deforms so\nthat the upper face moves sideways with respect to the lower. The horizontal displacement\n∆L of the upper face is perpendicular to the vertical height L. This type of deformation is\ncalled shear and the corresponding stress is the shearing stress. This type of stress is\npossible only in solids.\nIn this kind of deformation the Hooke’s law takes the form\n\nF/A = G × ∆L/L\nwhere ∆L is the displacement of one end of object in the direction of the applied force F,\nand G is the shear modulus.\n\n5. When an object undergoes hydraulic compression due to a stress exerted by a surrounding\nfluid, the Hooke’s law takes the form\n\np = B (∆V/V),\nwhere p is the pressure (hydraulic stress) on the object due to the fluid, ∆V/V  (the\nvolume strain) is the absolute fractional change in the object’s volume due to that\n\npressure and B is the bulk modulus of the object.\n\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n\n1. In the case of a wire, suspended from celing and stretched under the action of a weight (F)\n\nsuspended from its other end, the force exerted by the ceiling on it is  equal and opposite\n\nto the weight. However, the tension at any cross-section A of the wire is just F and not\n\n2F. Hence, tensile stress which is equal to the tension per unit area is equal to F/A.\n\n2. Hooke’s law is valid only in the linear part of stress-strain curve.\n\n3. The Young’s modulus and shear modulus are relevant only for solids since only solids\n\nhave lengths and shapes.\n\n4. Bulk modulus is relevant for solids, liquid and gases.  It refers to the change in volume\n\nwhen every part of the body is under the uniform stress so that the shape of the body\n\nremains unchanged.\n\ndue to gravity. The material at the bottom\nexperiences this force in the vertical direction,\nand the sides of the mountain are free. Therefore,\nthis is not a case of pressure or bulk compression.\nThere is a shear component, approximately hρg\nitself. Now the elastic limit for a typical rock is\n\n30 × 107 N m-2. Equating this to hρg, with\nρ  = 3 × 103 kg m-3 gives\n\nhρg  = 30 × 107 N m-2 .\nh      =  30 × 107 N m-2/(3 × 103 kg m-3 × 10 m s-2)\n      = 10 km\n\nwhich is more than the height of Mt. Everest!\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF SOLIDS 247\n\n5. Metals have larger values of Young’s modulus than alloys and elastomers. A material\n\nwith large value of Young’s modulus requires a large force to produce small changes in\n\nits length.\n\n6. In daily life, we feel that a material which stretches more is more elastic, but it a is\n\nmisnomer. In fact material which stretches to a lesser extent for a given load is considered\n\nto be more elastic.\n\n7. In general, a deforming force in one direction can produce strains in other directions\n\nalso. The proportionality between stress and strain in such situations cannot be described\n\nby just one elastic constant.  For example, for a wire under longitudinal strain, the\n\nlateral dimensions (radius of cross section) will undergo a small change, which is described\n\nby another elastic constant of the material (called Poisson ratio).\n\n8. Stress is not a vector quantity since, unlike a force, the stress cannot be assigned a\n\nspecific direction. Force acting on the portion of a body on a specified side of a section\n\nhas a definite direction.\n\nEXERCISES\n\n9.1 A steel wire of length 4.7 m and cross-sectional area 3.0 × 10-5 m2 stretches by the same\namount as a copper wire of length 3.5 m and cross-sectional area of 4.0 × 10–5 m2 under\na given load.

Liquids and gases can  flow\nand are therefore, called  fluids.  It is this property that\ndistinguishes liquids and gases from solids in a basic way.\n\nFluids are everywhere around us. Earth has an envelop of\nair and two-thirds of its surface is covered with water.  Water\nis not only necessary for our existence; every mammalian\nbody constitute mostly of water. All the  processes occurring\nin living beings including plants are mediated by fluids. Thus\nunderstanding the behaviour and properties of fluids is\nimportant.\n\nHow are fluids different from solids? What is common in\nliquids and gases? Unlike  a solid, a fluid has no definite\nshape of its own. Solids and liquids have a fixed volume,\nwhereas a gas fills the entire volume of its container. We\nhave learnt in the previous chapter that the volume of solids\ncan be changed by stress. The volume of solid, liquid or gas\ndepends on the stress or pressure acting on it. When we\ntalk about fixed volume of solid or liquid, we mean its volume\nunder atmospheric pressure. The difference between gases\nand solids or liquids is that for solids or liquids the change\nin volume due to  change of external pressure is rather small.\nIn other words solids and liquids have much lower\ncompressibility as compared to gases.\n\nShear stress can change the shape of a solid keeping its\nvolume fixed. The key property of fluids is that they offer\nvery little resistance to shear stress; their shape changes by\napplication of very small shear stress. The shearing stress\nof fluids is about million times smaller than that of solids.\n\n10.2  PRESSURE\n\nA sharp needle when pressed against our skin pierces it. Our\nskin, however, remains intact when a blunt object with a\nwider contact area (say the back of a spoon) is pressed against\nit with the same force. If an elephant were to step on a man’s\nchest, his ribs would crack. A circus performer across whose\n\n10.1 Introduction\n\n10.2 Pressure\n\n10.3 Streamline flow\n\n10.4 Bernoulli’s principle\n\n10.5 Viscosity\n\n10.6 Surface tension\n\nSummary\n\nPoints to ponder\n\nExercises\n\nAdditional exercises\n\nAppendix\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nchest a large, light but strong wooden plank is\nplaced first, is saved from this accident. Such\neveryday experiences convince us that both the\nforce and its coverage area are important. Smaller\nthe area on which the force acts, greater is the\nimpact. This impact is known as pressure.\n\nWhen an object is submerged in a fluid at\nrest, the fluid exerts a force on its surface. This\nforce is always normal to the object’s surface.\nThis is so because if there were a component of\nforce parallel to the surface, the object will also\nexert a force on the fluid parallel to it; as a\nconsequence of Newton’s third law. This force\nwill cause the fluid to flow parallel to the surface.\nSince the fluid is at rest, this cannot happen.\nHence, the force exerted by the fluid at rest has\nto be perpendicular to the surface in contact\nwith it. This is shown in Fig.10.1(a).\n\nThe normal force exerted by the fluid at a point\nmay be measured. An idealised form of one such\npressure-measuring device is shown in Fig.\n10.1(b). It consists of an evacuated chamber with\na spring that is calibrated to measure the force\nacting on the piston. This device is placed at a\npoint inside the fluid. The inward force exerted\nby the fluid on the piston is balanced by the\noutward spring force and is thereby measured.\n\nIf F is the magnitude of this normal force on the\npiston of area A then the average pressure P\n\nav\n\nis defined as the normal force acting per unit\narea.\n\nP\nF\n\nA\nav =              (10.1)\n\nIn principle, the piston area can be made\narbitrarily small. The pressure is then defined\nin a limiting sense as\n\nP = \nlim\n\n∆A 0→\n∆\n∆\n\nF\n\nA\n(10.2)\n\nPressure is a scalar quantity. We remind the\nreader that it is the component of the force\nnormal to the area under consideration and not\nthe (vector) force that appears in the numerator\nin Eqs. (10.1) and (10.2). Its dimensions are\n[ML–1T–2]. The SI unit of pressure is N m–2. It has\nbeen named as pascal (Pa) in honour of the\nFrench scientist Blaise Pascal (1623-1662) who\ncarried out pioneering studies on fluid pressure.\nA common unit of pressure is the atmosphere\n(atm), i.e. the pressure exerted by the\natmosphere at sea level (1 atm = 1.013 ×  105 Pa).\n\nAnother quantity, that is indispensable in\ndescribing fluids, is the density ρ. For a fluid of\nmass m occupying volume V,\n\nρ =\nm\n\nV\n(10.3)\n\nThe dimensions of density are [ML–3]. Its SI\nunit is kg m–3. It is a positive scalar quantity. A\nliquid is largely incompressible and its density\nis therefore, nearly constant at all pressures.\nGases, on the other hand exhibit a large\nvariation in densities with pressure.\n\nThe density of water at 4\no\nC (277 K) is\n\n1.0 ×  103 kg m–3. The relative density of a\nsubstance is the ratio of its density to the\ndensity of water at 4oC. It is a dimensionless\npositive scalar quantity. For example the relative\ndensity of aluminium is 2.7. Its density is\n2.7 ×  103 kg m–3.  The densities of some common\nfluids are displayed in Table 10.1.\n\nTable 10.1 Densities of some common fluids\n\nat STP*(a) (b)\nFig. 10.1 (a) The force exerted by the liquid in the\n\nbeaker on the submerged object or on the\n\nwalls is normal (perpendicular) to the\n\nsurface at all points.\n\n(b) An idealised device for measuring\n\npressure.\n\n* STP means standard temperature (00C) and 1 atm pressure.\n\nMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS 251\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n252 PHYSICS\n\nt\n\nExample 10.1   The two thigh bones\n(femurs), each of cross-sectional area10 cm2\n\nsupport the upper part of a human body of\nmass 40 kg. Estimate the average pressure\nsustained by the femurs.\n\nAnswer   Total cross-sectional area of the\nfemurs is A = 2 ×  10 cm2 = 20 ×  10–4 m2. The\nforce acting on them is F = 40 kg wt = 400 N\n(taking g = 10 m s–2). This force is acting\nvertically down and hence, normally on the\nfemurs. Thus, the average pressure is\n\n25\nm N 10  2    \n\n−×==\nA\n\nF\nPav                             t\n\n10.2.1 Pascal’s Law\n\nThe French scientist Blaise Pascal observed that\nthe pressure in a fluid at rest is the same at all\npoints if they are at the same height. This fact\nmay be demonstrated in a simple way.\n\nFig. 10.2 shows an element in the interior of\na fluid at rest. This element ABC-DEF is in the\nform of a right-angled prism. In principle, this\nprismatic element is very small so that every\npart of it can be considered at the same depth\nfrom the liquid surface and therefore, the effect\nof the gravity is the same at all these points.\nBut for clarity we have enlarged this element.\nThe forces on this element are those exerted by\nthe rest of the fluid and they must be normal to\nthe surfaces of the element as discussed above.\nThus, the fluid exerts pressures P\n\na\n, P\n\nb \nand P\n\nc\n on\n\nthis element of area corresponding to the normal\nforces F\n\na\n, F\n\nb\n and F\n\nc\n as shown in Fig. 10.2 on the\n\nfaces BEFC, ADFC and ADEB denoted by A\na\n, A\n\nb\n\nand A\nc\n respectively. Then\n\nF\nb \nsinθ = F\n\nc\n, F\n\nb \ncosθ = F\n\na\n(by equilibrium)\n\nA\nb \nsinθ = A\n\nc\n, A\n\nb \ncosθ = A\n\na\n(by geometry)\n\nThus,\n\n;b c a b c a\nb c a\n\nF F F\nP P P\n\nA A A\n= = = = (10.4)\n\nHence, pressure exerted is same in all\ndirections in a fluid at rest. It again reminds us\nthat like other types of stress, pressure is not a\nvector quantity. No direction can be assigned\nto it.  The force against any area within (or\nbounding) a fluid at rest and under pressure is\nnormal to the area, regardless of the orientation\nof the area.\n\nNow consider a fluid element in the form of a\nhorizontal bar of uniform cross-section. The bar\nis in equilibrium. The horizontal forces exerted\nat its two ends  must be balanced or the\npressure at the two ends should be equal. This\nproves that for a liquid in equilibrium the\npressure is same at all points in a horizontal\nplane. Suppose the pressure were not equal in\ndifferent parts of the fluid, then there would be\na flow as the  fluid will have some net force\nacting on it. Hence in the absence of flow the\npressure in the fluid must be same everywhere\nin a horizontal plane.\n\n10.2.2 Variation of Pressure with Depth\n\nConsider a fluid at rest in a container. In\nFig. 10.3 point 1 is at height h above a point 2.\nThe pressures at points 1 and 2 are P\n\n1\n and P\n\n2\n\nrespectively. Consider a cylindrical element of\nfluid having area of base A and height h. As the\nfluid is at rest the resultant horizontal forces\nshould be zero and the resultant vertical forces\nshould balance the weight of the element. The\nforces acting in the vertical direction are due to\nthe fluid pressure at the top (P\n\n1\nA) acting\n\ndownward, at the bottom (P\n2\nA) acting upward.\n\nIf mg is weight of the fluid in the cylinder we\nhave\n\n(P\n2 \n\n− P\n1\n) A = mg (10.5)\n\nNow, if ρ is the mass density of the fluid, we\nhave the mass of fluid to be m = ρV= ρhA so\nthat\n\nP\n2 \n\n−\n \nP\n\n1\n=  ρgh (10.6)\n\nFig. 10.2 Proof of Pascal’s law. ABC-DEF is an\nelement of the interior of a fluid at rest.\n\nThis element is in the form of a right-\n\nangled prism. The element is small so that\n\nthe effect of gravity can be ignored, but it\n\nhas been enlarged for the sake of clarity.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS 253\n\nt\n\nFig.10.3 Fluid under gravity. The effect of gravity is\nillustrated through pressure on a vertical\n\ncylindrical column.\n\nPressure difference depends on the vertical\n\ndistance h between the points (1 and 2), mass\n\ndensity of the fluid ρ and acceleration due to\ngravity g. If the point 1 under discussion is\n\nshifted to the top of the  fluid (say, water), which\n\nis open to the atmosphere, P\n1\n may be replaced\n\nby atmospheric pressure (P\na\n) and we replace P\n\n2\n\nby P. Then Eq. (10.6) gives\n\nP =\n \nP\n\na \n+ ρgh (10.7)\n\nThus, the pressure P, at depth below the\n\nsurface of a liquid open to the atmosphere is\n\ngreater than atmospheric pressure by an\n\namount ρgh. The excess of pressure, P −\n \nP\n\na\n, at\n\ndepth h is called a gauge pressure at that point.\n\nThe area of the cylinder is not appearing in\n\nthe expression of absolute pressure in Eq. (10.7).\n\nThus, the height of the fluid column is important\n\nand not cross-sectional or base area or the shape\n\nof the container. The liquid pressure is the same\n\nat all points at the same horizontal level (same\n\ndepth).  The result is appreciated through the\n\nexample of hydrostatic paradox. Consider three\n\nvessels A, B and C  [Fig.10.4] of different shapes.\n\nThey are connected at the bottom by a horizontal\n\npipe. On filling with water, the level in the three\n\nvessels is the same, though they hold different\n\namounts of water. This is so because water at\n\nthe bottom has the same pressure below each\n\nsection of the vessel.\n\nFig 10.4 Illustration of hydrostatic paradox. The\nthree vessels A, B and C contain different\n\namounts of liquids, all upto the same\n\nheight.\n\nExample 10.2 What is the pressure on a\nswimmer 10 m below the surface of a lake?\n\nAnswer Here\nh = 10 m and ρ = 1000 kg m-3. Take g = 10 m s–2\n\nFrom Eq. (10.7)\nP =\n\n \nP\n\na \n+ ρgh\n\n   = 1.01 × 105 Pa + 1000 kg m–3 × 10 m s–2 × 10 m\n   = 2.01 × 105 Pa\n    ≈ 2 atm\n\nThis is a 100% increase in pressure from\nsurface level. At a depth of 1 km, the increase\nin pressure is 100 atm! Submarines are designed\nto withstand such enormous pressures.   t\n\n10.2.3 Atmospheric Pressure and\nGauge Pressure\n\nThe pressure of the atmosphere at any point is\nequal to the weight of a column of air of unit\ncross-sectional area extending from that point\nto the top of the atmosphere. At sea level, it is\n1.013 × 105 Pa (1 atm). Italian scientist\nEvangelista Torricelli (1608–1647) devised for\nthe first time a method for measuring\natmospheric pressure. A long glass tube closed\nat one end and filled with mercury is inverted\ninto a trough of mercury as shown in Fig.10.5 (a).\nThis device is known as ‘mercury barometer’.\nThe space above the mercury column in the tube\ncontains only mercury vapour whose pressure\nP is so small  that it may be neglected. Thus,\nthe pressure at Point A=0. The pressure inside\nthe coloumn at Point B must be the same as the\npressure at Point C, which is atmospheric\npressure, Pa.\n\nP\na \n= ρgh (10.8)\n\nwhere ρ is the density of mercury and h is the\nheight of the mercury column in the tube.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n254 PHYSICS\n\nt\n\nt\n\nIn the experiment it is found that the mercury\ncolumn in the barometer has a height of about\n76 cm at sea level equivalent to one atmosphere\n(1 atm). This can also be obtained using the\nvalue of ρ in Eq. (10.8). A common way of stating\npressure is in terms of cm or mm of mercury\n(Hg). A pressure equivalent of 1 mm is called a\ntorr (after Torricelli).\n\n1 torr = 133 Pa.\nThe mm of Hg and torr are used in medicine\n\nand physiology. In meteorology, a common unit\nis the bar and millibar.\n\n1 bar = 105 Pa\nAn open tube manometer is a useful\n\ninstrument for measuring pressure differences.\nIt consists of a U-tube containing a suitable\nliquid i.e., a low density liquid (such as oil) for\nmeasuring small pressure differences and a\nhigh density liquid (such as mercury) for large\npressure differences. One end of the tube is open\nto the atmosphere and the other end is\nconnected to the system whose pressure we want\nto measure [see Fig. 10.5 (b)]. The pressure P at\nA is equal to pressure at point B. What we\nnormally measure is the gauge pressure, which\nis P − P\n\na\n, given by Eq. (10.8) and is proportional\n\nto manometer height h.\n\nPressure is same at the same level on both\nsides of the U-tube containing a fluid. For\nliquids, the density varies very little over wide\nranges in pressure and temperature and we can\ntreat it safely as a constant for our present\npurposes. Gases on the other hand, exhibits\nlarge variations of densities with changes in\npressure and temperature. Unlike gases, liquids\nare, therefore, largely treated as incompressible.\n\nExample 10.3 The density of the\natmosphere at sea level is 1.29 kg/m3.\nAssume that it does not change with\naltitude. Then how high would the\natmosphere extend?\n\nAnswer We use Eq. (10.7)\n\nρgh  =  1.29 kg m–3 × 9.8 m s2 × h  m = 1.01 × 105 Pa\n\n∴ h = 7989 m ≈ 8 km\nIn reality the density of air decreases with\n\nheight. So does the value of g. The atmospheric\n\ncover extends with decreasing pressure over\n\n100 km. We should also note that the sea level\n\natmospheric pressure is not always 760 mm of\n\nHg. A drop in the Hg level by 10 mm or more is a\n\nsign of an approaching storm. t\n\nExample 10.4 At a depth of 1000 m in an\nocean (a) what is the absolute pressure?\n(b) What is the gauge pressure?

Since\n\nthe area of the window is A = 0.04 m2, the\nforce acting on it is\nF = P\n\ng\n A = 103 ×  105 Pa ×  0.04 m2 = 4.12 ×  105 N\n\n  t\n\n10.2.4  Hydraulic Machines\n\nLet us now consider what happens when we\nchange the pressure on a fluid contained in a\nvessel. Consider a horizontal cylinder with a\n\npiston and three vertical tubes at different\n\npoints [Fig. 10.6 (a)]. The pressure in the\n\nhorizontal cylinder is indicated by the height of\n\nliquid column in the vertical tubes. It is necessarily\n\nthe same in all. If we push the piston, the fluid level\n\nrises in all the tubes, again reaching the same level\nin each one of them.\n\n     This indicates that when the pressure  on the\ncylinder was increased, it was distributed\nuniformly throughout. We can say  whenever\nexternal pressure is applied on any part of a\nfluid contained in a vessel, it is transmitted\nundiminished and equally in all directions.\nThis is another form of the Pascal’s law and it\nhas many applications in daily life.\n\nA number of devices, such as hydraulic lift\nand hydraulic brakes, are based on the Pascal’s\nlaw. In these devices, fluids are used for\ntransmitting pressure. In a hydraulic lift, as\nshown in Fig. 10.6 (b), two pistons are separated\nby the space filled with a liquid. A piston of small\ncross-section A\n\n1\n is used to exert a force F\n\n1\n directly\n\non the liquid. The pressure P = \n1\n\n1\n\nF\n\nA\n is\n\ntransmitted throughout the liquid to the larger\ncylinder attached with a larger piston of area A\n\n2\n,\n\nwhich results in an upward force of P × A\n2\n.\n\nTherefore, the piston is capable of supporting a\nlarge force (large weight of, say a car, or a truck,\n\nArchemedes’ Principle\nFluid appears to provide partial support to the objects placed in it.  When a body is wholly or partially\nimmersed in a fluid at rest, the fluid exerts pressure on the surface of the body in contact with the\nfluid. The pressure is greater on lower surfaces of the body than on the upper surfaces as pressure in\na fluid increases with depth. The resultant of all the forces is an upward force called buoyant force.\nSuppose that a cylindrical body is immersed in the fluid. The upward force on the bottom of the body\nis more than the downward force on its top. The fluid exerts a resultant upward force or buoyant force\n\non the body equal to (P\n2 \n– P\n\n1\n) ×××××      A (Fig. 10.3). We have seen in equation 10.4 that (P\n\n2\n-P\n\n1\n)A = ρghA. Now,\n\nhA is the volume of the solid and  ρhA is the weight of an equivaliant volume of the fluid. (P\n2\n-P\n\n1\n)A = mg.\n\nThus, the upward force exerted is equal to the weight of the displaced fluid.\nThe result holds true irrespective of the shape of the object and here cylindrical object is considered\n\nonly for convenience. This is Archimedes’ principle. For totally immersed objects the volume of the\nfluid displaced by the object is equal to its own volume. If the density of the immersed object is more\nthan that of the fluid, the object will sink as the weight of the body is more than the upward thrust. If\nthe density of the object is less than that of the fluid, it floats in the fluid partially submerged. To\ncalculate the volume submerged, suppose the total volume of the object is V\n\ns\n and  a part V\n\np \nof it is\n\nsubmerged  in the fluid.  Then, the upward force which is the weight of the displaced fluid is ρ\nf\ngV\n\np\n,\n\nwhich must equal the weight of the body; ρ\ns\ngV\n\ns\n = ρ\n\nf\ngV\n\np\nor  ρ\n\ns\n/ρ\n\nf\n = V\n\np\n/V\n\ns \n The apparent weight of the\n\nfloating body is zero.\nThis principle can be summarised as; ‘the loss of weight of a body submerged (partially or fully) in\n\na fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced’.\n\nFig 10.6  (a) Whenever external pressure is applied\n   on any part of a fluid in a vessel, it is\n\nequally transmitted in all directions.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n256 PHYSICS\n\nt\n\nt\n\nplaced on the platform) F\n2 \n\n= PA\n2 \n\n= \n1 2\n\n1\n\nF A\n\nA\n.

Thus, the applied force has\n\nbeen increased by a factor of \n2\n\n1\n\nA\n\nA\n and this factor\n\nis the mechanical advantage of the device. The\nexample below clarifies it.\n\nFig 10.6 (b) Schematic diagram illustrating the principle\n  behind the hydraulic lift, a device used to\n\n  lift heavy loads.\n\nExample 10.5 Two syringes of different\ncross-sections (without needles) filled with\nwater are connected with a tightly fitted\nrubber tube filled with water.

When we apply a little force\non the pedal with our foot the master piston\n\nArchimedes was a Greek philosopher, mathematician, scientist and engineer. He\ninvented the catapult and devised a system of pulleys and levers to handle heavy\nloads. The king of his native city Syracuse, Hiero II, asked him to determine if his gold\ncrown was alloyed with some cheaper metal, such as silver without damaging the crown.\nThe partial loss of weight he experienced while lying in his bathtub suggested a solution\n\nto him. According to legend, he ran naked through the streets of Syracuse, exclaiming “Eureka,\neureka!”, which means “I have found it, I have found it!”\n\nArchimedes (287–212 B.C.)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS 257\n\nmoves inside the master cylinder, and the\npressure caused is transmitted through the\nbrake oil to act on a piston of larger area. A large\nforce acts on the piston and is pushed down\nexpanding the brake shoes against brake lining.\nIn this way, a small force on the pedal produces\na large retarding force on the wheel. An\nimportant advantage of the system is that the\npressure set up by pressing pedal is transmitted\nequally to all cylinders attached to the four\nwheels so that the braking effort is equal on\nall wheels.\n\n10.3  STREAMLINE FLOW\n\nSo far we have studied fluids at rest. The study\nof the fluids in motion is known as fluid\ndynamics. When a water tap is turned on slowly,\n\nthe water flow is smooth initially, but loses its\n\nsmoothness when the speed of the outflow is\n\nincreased. In studying the motion of fluids, we\n\nfocus our attention on what is happening to\n\nvarious fluid particles at a particular point in\nspace at a particular time. The flow of the fluid\n\nis said to be steady if at any given point, the\nvelocity of each passing fluid particle remains\n\nconstant in time. This does not mean that the\n\nvelocity at different points in space is same. The\n\nvelocity of a particular particle may change as it\nmoves from one point to another. That is, at some\n\nother point the particle may have a different\n\nvelocity, but every other particle which passes\n\nthe second point behaves exactly as the previous\n\nparticle that has just passed that point. Each\n\nparticle follows a smooth path, and the paths of\nthe particles do not cross each other.\n\nFig. 10.7 The meaning of streamlines. (a) A typical\ntrajectory of a fluid particle.\n\n(b) A region of streamline flow.\n\nThe path taken by a fluid particle under a\nsteady flow is a streamline. It is defined as a\ncurve whose tangent at any point is in the\ndirection of the fluid velocity at that point.\nConsider the path of a particle as shown in\nFig.10.7 (a), the curve describes how a fluid\nparticle moves with time. The curve PQ is like a\npermanent map of fluid flow, indicating how the\nfluid streams. No two streamlines can cross, for\nif they do, an oncoming fluid particle can go\neither one way or the other and the flow would\nnot be steady. Hence, in steady flow, the map of\nflow is stationary in time. How do we draw closely\nspaced streamlines ? If we intend to show\nstreamline of every flowing particle, we would\nend up with a continuum of lines. Consider planes\nperpendicular to the direction of fluid flow e.g.,\nat three points P, R and Q in Fig.10.7 (b). The\nplane pieces are so chosen that their boundaries\nbe determined by the same set of streamlines.\nThis means that number of fluid particles\ncrossing the surfaces as indicated at P, R and Q\nis the same. If area of cross-sections at these\npoints are A\n\nP\n,A\n\nR\n and A\n\nQ\n and speeds of fluid\n\nparticles are v\nP\n, v\n\nR\n and v\n\nQ\n, then mass of fluid\n\n∆m\nP\n crossing at A\n\nP\n in a small interval of time ∆t\n\nis ρ\nP\nA\n\nP\nv\n\nP \n∆t. Similarly mass of fluid ∆m\n\nR\n flowing\n\nor crossing at A\nR\n in a small interval of time ∆t is\n\nρ\nR\nA\n\nR\nv\n\nR \n∆t and mass of fluid  ∆m\n\nQ\n is ρ\n\nQ\nA\n\nQ\nv\n\nQ \n∆t\n\ncrossing at A\nQ\n. The mass of liquid flowing out\n\nequals the mass flowing in, holds in all cases.\nTherefore,\n\nρ\nP\nA\n\nP\nv\n\nP\n∆t = ρ\n\nR\nA\n\nR\nv\n\nR\n∆t = ρ\n\nQ\nA\n\nQ\nv\n\nQ\n∆t (10.9)\n\nFor flow of incompressible fluids\nρ\n\nP\n = ρ\n\nR\n = ρ\n\nQ\n\nEquation (10.9) reduces to\nA\n\nP\nv\n\nP\n = A\n\nR\nv\n\nR\n = A\n\nQ\nv\n\nQ\n(10.10)\n\nwhich is called the equation of continuity and\nit is a statement of conservation of mass in flow\nof incompressible fluids. In general\n\nAv = constant (10.11)\nAv gives the volume flux or flow rate and\n\nremains constant throughout the pipe of flow.\nThus, at narrower portions where the\nstreamlines are closely spaced, velocity\nincreases and its vice versa. From (Fig 10.7b) it\nis clear that A\n\nR  \n> A\n\nQ \nor   v\n\nR\n <  v\n\nQ\n, the fluid is\n\naccelerated while passing from R to Q. This is\nassociated with a change in pressure in fluid\nflow in horizontal pipes.\n\nSteady flow is achieved at low flow speeds.\nBeyond a limiting value, called critical speed,\nthis flow loses steadiness and becomes\nturbulent. One sees this when a fast flowing\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n258 PHYSICS\n\nstream encounters rocks, small foamy\nwhirlpool-like regions called ‘white water\nrapids are formed.\n\nFigure 10.8 displays streamlines for some\ntypical flows. For example, Fig. 10.8(a) describes\na laminar flow where the velocities at different\npoints in the fluid may have dif ferent\nmagnitudes but their directions are parallel.\nFigure 10.8 (b) gives a sketch of turbulent flow.\n\nFig. 10.8 (a) Some streamlines for fluid flow.\n(b) A jet of air striking a flat plate placed\n\nperpendicular to it. This is an example\n\nof turbulent flow.\n\n10.4  BERNOULLI’S PRINCIPLE\n\nFluid flow is a complex phenomenon. But we\ncan obtain some useful properties for steady\nor streamline flows using the conservation\nof energy.\n\nConsider a fluid moving in a pipe of varying\ncross-sectional area. Let the pipe be at varying\nheights as shown in Fig. 10.9. We now suppose\nthat an incompressible fluid is flowing through\nthe pipe in a steady flow. Its velocity must\nchange as a consequence of equation of\ncontinuity. A force is required to produce this\nacceleration, which is   caused by the fluid\nsurrounding it, the pressure must be different\nin different regions. Bernoulli’s equation is a\ngeneral expression that relates the pressure\ndifference between two points in a pipe to both\nvelocity changes (kinetic energy change) and\nelevation (height) changes (potential energy\n\nchange). The Swiss Physicist Daniel Bernoulli\ndeveloped this relationship in 1738.\n\nConsider the flow at two regions 1 (i.e., BC)\nand 2 (i.e., DE). Consider the fluid initially lying\nbetween B and D. In an infinitesimal time\ninterval ∆t, this fluid would have moved. Suppose\nv\n\n1\n is the speed at B and v\n\n2\n at D, then fluid initially\n\nat B has moved a distance v\n1\n∆t to C (v\n\n1\n∆t is small\n\nenough to assume constant cross-section along\nBC). In the same interval ∆t the fluid initially at\nD moves to E, a distance equal to v\n\n2\n∆t. Pressures\n\nP\n1\n and P\n\n2\n act as shown on the plane faces of\n\nareas A\n1\n and A\n\n2\n binding the two regions. The\n\nwork done on the fluid at left end (BC) is W\n1\n =\n\nP\n1\nA\n\n1\n(v\n\n1\n∆t) = P\n\n1\n∆V. Since the same volume ∆V\n\npasses through both the regions (from the\nequation of continuity) the work done by the fluid\nat the other end (DE) is W\n\n2\n = P\n\n2\nA\n\n2\n(v\n\n2\n∆t) = P\n\n2\n∆V or,\n\nthe work done on the fluid is  –P\n2\n∆V.

The fluid in a\n\nsection of length v\n1\n∆t moves to the section\n\nof length v\n2\n∆t in time ∆t.\n\nIn words, the Bernoulli’s relation may be\nstated as follows: As we move along a streamline\nthe sum of the pressure (P ), the kinetic energy\n\nper unit volume \nρv2\n\n2\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8\uf8f7  and the potential energy\n\nper unit volume (ρgh) remains a constant.\nNote that in applying the energy conservation\n\nprinciple, there is an assumption that no energy\nis lost due to friction. But in fact, when fluids\nflow, some energy does get lost due to internal\nfriction. This arises due to the fact that in a\nfluid flow, the different layers of the fluid flow\nwith different velocities. These layers exert\nfrictional forces on each other resulting in a loss\nof energy. This property of the fluid is called\nviscosity and is discussed in more detail in a\nlater section. The lost kinetic energy of the fluid\ngets converted into heat energy. Thus,\nBernoulli’s equation ideally applies to fluids with\n\nzero viscosity or non-viscous fluids. Another\n\nrestriction on application of Bernoulli theorem\n\nis that the fluids must be incompressible, as\n\nthe elastic energy of the fluid is also not taken\n\ninto consideration. In practice, it has a large\n\nnumber of useful applications and can help\n\nexplain a wide variety of phenomena for low\n\nviscosity incompressible fluids.  Bernoulli’s\n\nequation also does not hold for non-steady or\n\nturbulent flows, because in that situation\n\nvelocity and pressure are constantly fluctuating\n\nin time.\n\nWhen a fluid is at rest i.e., its velocity is zero\n\neverywhere, Bernoulli’s equation becomes\n\nP\n1\n + ρgh\n\n1\n = P\n\n2\n + ρgh\n\n2\n\n(P\n1\n− P\n\n2\n) = ρg (h\n\n2 \n− h\n\n1\n)\n\nwhich is same as Eq. (10.6).\n\n10.4.1 Speed of Efflux: Torricelli’s Law\n\nThe word efflux means fluid outflow. Torricelli\ndiscovered that the speed of efflux from an open\ntank is given by a formula identical to that of a\nfreely falling body. Consider a tank containing\na liquid of density ρ with a small hole in its side\nat a height y\n\n1\n from the bottom (see Fig. 10.10).\n\nThe air above the liquid, whose surface is at\nheight y\n\n2\n, is at pressure P. From the equation\n\nof continuity [Eq. (10.10)] we have\nv\n\n1 \nA\n\n1\n = v\n\n2 \nA\n\n2\n\nv\nA\n\nA\nv2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n= 1\n\nFig. 10.10 Torricelli’s law. The speed of efflux, v\n1\n,\n\nfrom the side of the container is given by\n\nthe application of Bernoulli’s equation.\n\nIf the container is open at the top to the\n\natmosphere then 1   2  hv g= .\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n260 PHYSICS\n\nIf the cross-sectional area of the tank A\n2\n is\n\nmuch larger than that of the hole (A\n2\n >>A\n\n1\n), then\n\nwe may take the fluid to be approximately at rest\nat the top, i.e., v\n\n2\n = 0. Now, applying the Bernoulli\n\nequation at points 1 and 2 and noting that at\nthe hole P\n\n1\n = P\n\na\n, the atmospheric pressure, we\n\nhave from Eq. (10.12)\n\n2\n1 1 2\n\n1\n\n2\naP  v g y P g y             + ρ + ρ = + ρ\n\nTaking  y\n2\n – y\n\n1\n = h we have\n\n( )2\n2\n\na\n\n1\n\nP P\nv g h     \n\n−\n= +\n\nρ\n(10.14)\n\nWhen P >>P\na \nand 2 g h may be ignored, the\n\nspeed of efflux is determined by the container\npressure. Such a situation occurs in rocket\npropulsion. On the other hand, if the tank is\nopen to the atmosphere, then P  = P\n\na \nand\n\nhgv    21 = (10.15)\n\nThis is also the speed of a freely falling body.\nEquation (10.15) represents Torricelli’s law.\n\n10.4.2 Venturi-meter\n\nThe Venturi-meter is a device to measure the\nflow speed of incompressible fluid. It consists of\na tube with a broad diameter and a small\nconstriction at the middle as shown in\nFig. (10.11). A manometer in the form of a\nU-tube is also attached to it, with one arm at\nthe broad neck point of the tube and the other\nat constriction as shown in Fig. (10.11). The\nmanometer contains a liquid of density ρ\n\nm\n. The\n\nspeed v\n1 \nof the liquid flowing through the tube\n\nat the broad neck area A is to be measured\nfrom equation of continuity Eq. (10.10) the speed\n\nat the constriction becomes 2 1v v=\nA\n\na\n. Then\n\nusing Bernoulli’s equation (Eq.10.12) for (h\n1\n=h\n\n2\n),\n\nwe get\n\nP\n1\n+ \n\n1\n\n2\n ρv\n\n1\n2 = P\n\n2\n+\n\n1\n\n2\n ρv\n\n1\n2 (A/a)2\n\nSo that\n\nP\n1\n- P\n\n2\n = \n\n1\n\n2\n ρv\n\n1\n2 \n\nA\n\na\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8fb\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\n2\n\n1– (10.16)\n\nThis pressure difference causes the fluid in\nthe U-tube connected at the narrow neck to rise\nin comparison to the other arm.

The carburetor of automobile has\na Venturi channel (nozzle) through which air\nflows with a high speed. The pressure is then\nlowered at the narrow neck and the petrol\n(gasoline) is sucked up in the chamber to provide\nthe correct mixture of air to fuel necessary for\ncombustion. Filter pumps or aspirators, Bunsen\nburner, atomisers and sprayers [See Fig. 10.12]\nused for perfumes or to spray insecticides work\non the same principle.\n\nFig. 10.12 The spray gun.

The narrower part has an area\na = 4 mm2. The pressure drop in the artery\nis 24 Pa. What is the speed of the blood in\nthe artery?\n\nAnswer We take the density of blood from Table\n10.1 to be 1.06 ×  103 kg m-3. The ratio of the\n\nareas is \nA\n\na\n\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ed \uf8f8\n\n = 2. Using Eq. (10.17) we obtain\n\nt\n\n10.4.3 Blood Flow and Heart Attack\n\nBernoulli’s principle helps in explaining blood\n\nflow in artery. The artery may get constricted\n\ndue to the accumulation of plaque on its inner\n\nwalls. In order to drive the blood through this\n\nconstriction a greater demand is placed on the\n\nactivity of the heart. The speed of the flow of\n\nthe blood in this region is raised which lowers\n\nthe pressure inside and the artery may\n\ncollapse due to the external pressure. The\n\nheart exerts further pressure to open this\n\nartery and forces the blood through. As the\n\nblood rushes through the opening, the\n\ninternal pressure once again drops due to\n\nsame reasons leading to a repeat collapse.\n\nThis may result in heart attack.\n\n10.4.4 Dynamic Lift\n\nDynamic lift is the force that acts on a body,\n\nsuch as airplane wing, a hydrofoil or a spinning\n\nball, by virtue of its motion through a fluid. In\n\nmany games such as cricket, tennis, baseball,\n\nor golf, we notice that a spinning ball deviates\n\nfrom its parabolic trajectory as it moves through\n\nair. This deviation can be partly explained on\n\nthe basis of Bernoulli’s principle.\n\n(i) Ball moving without spin: Fig. 10.13(a)\n\nshows the streamlines around a\n\nnon-spinning ball moving relative to a fluid.\n\nFrom the symmetry of streamlines it is clear\n\nthat the velocity of fluid (air) above and below\n\nthe ball at corresponding points is the same\n\nresulting in zero pressure difference. The air\n\ntherefore, exerts no upward or downward\n\nforce on the ball.\n\n(ii) Ball moving with spin: A ball which is\n\nspinning drags air along with it. If the\n\nsurface is rough more air will be dragged.\n\nFig 10.13(b) shows  the streamlines of air\n\nfor a ball which is moving and spinning at\n\nthe same time. The ball is moving forward\n\nand relative to it the air is moving\n\nbackwards. Therefore, the velocity of air\n\nabove the ball relative to the ball is larger\n\nand below it is smaller (see Section 10.3).\n\nThe stream lines, thus, get crowded above\n\nand rarified below.\n\nThis difference in the velocities of air results\n\nin the pressure difference between the lower and\n\nupper faces and there is a net upward force on\n\nthe ball. This dynamic lift due to spining is called\n\nMagnus effect.\n\n(a) (b) (c)\n\nFig 10.13 (a) Fluid streaming past a static sphere. (b) Streamlines for a fluid around a sphere spinning  clockwise.\n(c) Air flowing past an aerofoil.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n262 PHYSICS\n\nt\n\nAerofoil or lift on aircraft wing: Figure 10.13\n\n(c) shows an aerofoil, which is a solid piece\n\nshaped to provide an upward dynamic lift when\n\nit moves horizontally through air. The cross-\n\nsection of the wings of an aeroplane looks\n\nsomewhat like the aerofoil shown in Fig. 10.13 (c)\n\nwith streamlines around it. When the aerofoil\n\nmoves against the wind, the orientation of the\n\nwing relative to flow direction causes the\n\nstreamlines to crowd together above the wing\n\nmore than those below it. The flow speed on top\n\nis higher than that below it. There is an upward\n\nforce resulting in a dynamic lift of the wings and\n\nthis balances the weight of the plane. The\n\nfollowing example illustrates this.\n\nExample 10.8 A fully loaded Boeing\n\naircraft has a mass of 3.3 ×  105 kg. Its total\nwing area is 500 m2. It is in level flight with\n\na speed of 960 km/h. (a) Estimate the\n\npressure difference between the lower and\n\nupper surfaces of the wings (b) Estimate\n\nthe fractional increase in the speed of the\n\nair on the upper surface of the wing relative\n\nto the lower surface. [The density of air is ρ\n= 1.2 kg m-3]\n\nAnswer (a) The weight of the Boeing aircraft is\n\nbalanced by the upward force due to the\n\npressure difference\n\n∆P × A = 3.3 ×  105 kg ×  9.8\n\nP∆ = (3.3 ×  105 kg ×  9.8 m s–2) / 500 m2\n\n      = 6.5 × 103 Nm-2\n\n(b) We ignore the small height difference\n\nbetween the top and bottom sides in Eq. (10.12).\n\nThe pressure difference between them is\n\nthen\n\n∆P v v= ( )ρ\n2\n\n2\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n–\n\nwhere v\n2\n is the speed of air over the upper\n\nsurface and v\n1\n is the speed under the bottom\n\nsurface.\n\nv v\nP\n\nv v\n2 1\n\n2 1\n\n2\n–( ) =\n\n+( )\n∆\n\nρ\n\nTaking the average speed\n\nv\nav\n = (v\n\n2 \n+ v\n\n1\n)/2 = 960 km/h = 267 m s-1,\n\nwe have\n\nv v v\nP\n\nv\n2 1 2\n\n– /( ) =av\nav\n\n∆\nρ ≈  0.08\n\nThe speed above the wing needs to be only 8\n% higher than that below. t\n\n10.5  VISCOSITY\n\nMost of the fluids are not ideal ones and offer some\n\nresistance to motion. This resistance to fluid motion\n\nis like an internal friction analogous to friction when\n\na solid moves on a surface. It is called  viscosity.\n\nThis force exists when there is relative motion\n\nbetween layers of the liquid. Suppose we consider\n\na fluid  like oil  enclosed between two glass plates\n\nas shown in Fig. 10.14 (a). The bottom plate is fixed\n\nwhile the top plate is moved with a constant\n\nvelocity v relative to the fixed plate. If oil is\n\nreplaced by honey, a greater force is required to\n\nmove the plate with the same velocity. Hence\n\nwe say that honey is more viscous than oil. The\n\nfluid in contact with a surface has the same\n\nvelocity as that of the surfaces. Hence, the layer\n\nof the liquid in contact with top surface moves\n\nwith a velocity v and the layer of the liquid in\n\ncontact with the fixed surface is stationary. The\n\nvelocities of layers increase uniformly from\n\nbottom (zero velocity) to the top layer (velocity\n\nv). For any layer of liquid, its upper layer pulls\n\nit forward while lower layer pulls it backward.\n\nThis results in force between the layers. This\n\ntype of flow is known as laminar. The layers of\n\nliquid slide over one another as the pages of a\n\nbook do when it is placed flat on a table and a\n\nhorizontal force is applied to the top cover. When\n\na fluid is flowing in a pipe or a tube, then  velocity\n\nof the liquid layer along the axis of the tube is\n\nmaximum and  decreases  gradually as we move\n\ntowards the walls where it becomes zero, Fig.\n\n10.14 (b). The velocity on a cylindrical surface\n\nin a tube is constant.\n\nOn account of this motion, a portion of liquid,\n\nwhich at some instant has the shape ABCD, take\n\nthe shape of AEFD after short interval of time\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS 263\n\nt\n\n(∆t). During this time interval the liquid has\nundergone a shear strain of\n\n∆x/l. Since, the strain in a flowing fluid\nincreases with time continuously. Unlike a solid,\n\nhere the stress is found experimentally to depend\n\non ‘rate of change of strain’ or ‘strain rate’ i.e.\n\n∆x/(l ∆t) or v/l instead of strain itself. The\ncoefficient of viscosity (pronounced ‘eta’) for a\n\nfluid is defined as the ratio of shearing stress to\n\nthe strain rate.\n\nη = =\nF A\n\nv l\n\nF l\n\nv A\n\n/\n\n/\n(10.18)\n\nThe SI unit of viscosity is poiseiulle (Pl). Its\n\nother units are N s m-2 or Pa s. The dimensions\n\nof viscosity are [ML-1T-1]. Generally, thin liquids,\n\nlike water, alcohol, etc., are less viscous than\n\nthick liquids, like coal tar, blood, glycerine, etc.\n\nThe coefficients of viscosity for some common\n\nfluids are listed in Table 10.2. We point out two\n\nfacts about blood and water that you may find\n\ninteresting. As Table 10.2 indicates, blood is\n\n‘thicker’ (more viscous) than water. Further, the\n\nrelative viscosity (η/η\nwater\n\n) of blood remains\n\nconstant between 0 \no\nC and 37 \n\no\nC.\n\nThe viscosity of liquids decreases with\n\ntemperature, while it increases in the case of gases.\n\nExample 10.9 A metal block of area 0.10 m2\n\nis connected to a 0.010 kg mass via a string\n\nthat passes over an ideal pulley (considered\n\nmassless and frictionless), as in Fig. 10.15.\n\nA liquid with a film thickness of 0.30 mm\n\nis placed between the block and the table.\n\nWhen released the block moves to the right\n\nwith a constant speed of 0.085 m s-1. Find\n\nthe coefficient of viscosity of the liquid.\n\nAnswer The metal block moves to the right\n\nbecause of the tension in the string. The tension\n\nT is equal in magnitude to the weight of the\n\nsuspended mass m. Thus, the shear force  F  is\n\nF = T = mg = 0.010 kg ×  9.8 m s–2 = 9.8 ×  10-2 N\n\nShear stress on the fluid = F/A = N/m2\n\nStrain rate = \n\nη =\nstress\n\nstrain rate\ns\n\n-1\n\n  = \n\n  = 3.46 × 10-3 Pa s\n  t\n\n(a)\n\nFig. 10.15 Measurement of the coefficient of viscosity\nof a liquid.\n\n(b)\n\nFig 10.14 (a) A layer of liquid sandwiched between\ntwo parallel glass plates, in which the\n\nlower plate is fixed and the upper one is\n\nmoving to the right with velocity v\n(b) velocity distribution for viscous flow in\n\na pipe.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n264 PHYSICS\n\nt\n\nwhere ρ and σ are mass densities of sphere and\nthe fluid, respectively. We obtain\n\nv\nt\n = 2a2 (ρ-σ)g / (9η) (10.20)\n\nSo the terminal velocity v\nt\n depends on the\n\nsquare of the radius of the sphere and inversely\n\non the viscosity of the medium.\n\nYou may like to refer back to Example 6.2 in\n\nthis context.\n\nExample 10.10 The terminal velocity of a\n\ncopper ball of radius 2.0 mm falling through\n\na tank of oil at 20oC is 6.5 cm s-1. Compute\n\nthe viscosity of the oil at 20oC.

As\n\nliquids have no definite shape but have a\n\ndefinite volume, they acquire a free surface when\n\npoured in a container. These surfaces  possess\n\nsome additional  energy. This phenomenon is\n\nknown as surface tension and it is concerned\n\nwith only liquid as gases do not have free\n\nsurfaces.  Let us now understand this\n\nphenomena.\n\nTable10.2 The viscosities of some fluids\n\nFluid T(oC) Viscosity (mPl)\n\nWater 20 1.0\n\n100 0.3\n\nBlood 37 2.7\n\nMachine Oil 16 113\n\n38 34\n\nGlycerine 20 830\n\nHoney – 200\n\nAir 0 0.017\n\n40 0.019\n\n10.5.1 Stokes’ Law\n\nWhen a body falls through a fluid it drags the\n\nlayer of the fluid in contact with it. A relative\n\nmotion between the different layers of the fluid\n\nis set and, as a result, the body experiences a\n\nretarding force. Falling of a raindrop and\n\nswinging of a pendulum bob are some common\n\nexamples of such motion. It is seen that the\n\nviscous force is proportional to the velocity of\n\nthe object and is opposite to the direction of\n\nmotion. The other quantities on which the force\n\nF depends are viscosity η of the fluid and radius\na of the sphere. Sir George G. Stokes (1819–\n\n1903), an English scientist enunciated clearly\n\nthe viscous drag force F as\n\n6F avη= π (10.19)\n\nThis is known as Stokes’ law. We shall not\n\nderive Stokes’ law.\n\nThis law is an interesting example of retarding\n\nforce, which is proportional to velocity. We can\n\nstudy its consequences on an object falling\n\nthrough a viscous  medium. We consider a\n\nraindrop in air. It accelerates initially due to\n\ngravity. As the velocity increases, the retarding\n\nforce also increases. Finally, when viscous force\n\nplus buoyant force becomes equal to the force\n\ndue to gravity, the net force becomes zero and so\n\ndoes the acceleration. The sphere (raindrop) then\n\ndescends with a constant velocity. Thus, in\n\nequilibrium, this terminal velocity v\nt \nis given by\n\n6πηav\nt\n = (4π/3) a3 (ρ-σ)g\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS 265\n\nFig. 10.16 Schematic picture of molecules in a liquid, at the surface and balance of forces.

(c) Balance of attractive (AI and repulsive (R) forces.\n\nterms of this fact. What is the energy required\n\nfor having a molecule at the surface? As\n\nmentioned above, roughly it is half the energy\n\nrequired to remove it entirely from the liquid\n\ni.e., half the heat of evaporation.\n\nFinally, what is a surface? Since a liquid\n\nconsists of molecules moving about, there cannot\n\nbe a perfectly sharp surface. The density of the\n\nliquid molecules drops rapidly to zero around\n\nz = 0 as we move along the direction indicated\n\nFig 10.16 (c) in a distance of the order of a few\n\nmolecular sizes.\n\nand to disperse them far away from each other\n\nin order to evaporate or vaporise, the heat of\n\nevaporation required is quite large. For water it\n\nis of the order of 40 kJ/mol.\n\nLet us consider a molecule near the surface\n\nFig. 10.16(b). Only lower half side of it is\n\nsurrounded by liquid molecules. There is some\n\nnegative potential energy due to these, but\n\nobviously it is less than that of a molecule in\n\nbulk, i.e., the one fully inside. Approximately\n\nit is half of the latter. Thus, molecules on a\n\nliquid surface have some extra energy in\n\ncomparison to molecules in the interior.  A\n\nliquid, thus, tends to have the least surface\n\narea which external conditions permit.\n\nIncreasing surface area requires energy. Most\n\nsurface phenomenon can be understood in\n\n10.6.2 Surface Energy and Surface Tension\n\nAs we have discussed that an extra energy is\n\nassociated with surface of liquids, the creation\n\nof more surface (spreading of surface) keeping\n\nother things like volume fixed requires\n\nadditional energy. To appreciate this, consider\n\na horizontal liquid film ending in bar free to slide\n\nover parallel guides Fig (10.17).\n\n10.6.1 Surface Energy\n\nA liquid stays together because of attraction\n\nbetween molecules. Consider a molecule well\n\ninside a liquid. The intermolecular distances are\n\nsuch that it is attracted to all the surrounding\n\nmolecules [Fig. 10.16(a)]. This attraction results\n\nin a negative potential energy for the molecule,\n\nwhich depends on the number and distribution\n\nof molecules around the chosen one. But the\n\naverage potential energy of all the molecules is\n\nthe same. This is supported by the fact that to\n\ntake a collection of such molecules (the liquid)\n\nFig. 10.17 Stretching a film.

Since the area of the\n\nsurface increases, the system now has more\n\nenergy, this means that some work has been\n\ndone against an internal force. Let this internal\n\nforce be F, the work done by the applied force is\n\nF.d = Fd. From conservation of energy, this is\n\nstored as additional energy in the film. If the\n\nsurface energy of the film is S per unit area, the\n\nextra area is 2dl. A film has two sides and the\n\nliquid in between, so there are two surfaces and\n\nthe extra energy is\n\nS (2dl) = Fd (10.21)\n\nOr, S=Fd/2dl = F/2l (10.22)\n\nThis quantity S is the magnitude of surface\n\ntension. It is equal to the surface energy per unit\n\narea of the liquid interface and is also equal to\n\nthe force per unit length exerted by the fluid on\n\nthe movable bar.\n\nSo far we have talked about the surface of one\n\nliquid. More generally, we need to consider fluid\n\nsurface in contact with other fluids or solid\n\nsurfaces. The surface energy in that case depends\n\non the materials on both sides of the surface. For\n\nexample, if the molecules of the materials attract\n\neach other, surface energy is reduced while if they\n\nrepel each other the surface energy is increased.\n\nThus, more appropriately, the surface energy is\n\nthe energy of the interface between two materials\n\nand depends on both of them.\n\nWe make the following observations from\n\nabove:\n\n(i) Surface tension is a force per unit length\n\n(or surface energy per unit area) acting in\n\nthe plane of the interface between the plane\n\nof the liquid and any other substance; it also\n\nis the extra energy that the molecules at the\n\ninterface have as compared to molecules in\n\nthe interior.\n\n(ii) At any point on the interface besides the\n\nboundary, we can draw a line and imagine\n\nequal and opposite surface tension forces S\n\nper unit length of the line acting\n\nperpendicular to the line, in the plane of the\n\ninterface. The line is in equilibrium. To be\n\nmore specific, imagine a line of atoms or\n\nmolecules at the surface. The atoms to the\n\nleft pull the line towards them; those to the\n\nright pull it towards them! This line of atoms\n\nis in equilibrium under tension. If the line\n\nreally marks the end of the interface, as in\n\nFigure 10.16 (a) and (b) there is only the force\n\nS per unit length acting inwards.\n\nTable 10.3 gives the surface tension of various\n\nliquids. The value of surface tension depends\n\non temperature. Like viscosity, the surface\n\ntension of a liquid usually falls with\n\ntemperature.\n\nTable 10.3 Surface tension of some liquids at the\ntemperatures indicated with the\nheats of the vaporisation\n\nLiquid Temp (oC) Surface Heat of\n\nTension vaporisation\n (N/m)  (kJ/mol)\n\nHelium –270 0.000239 0.115\n\nOxygen –183 0.0132 7.1\n\nEthanol 20 0.0227 40.6\n\nWater 20 0.0727 44.16\n\nMercury 20 0.4355 63.2\n\nA fluid will stick to a solid surface if the\n\nsurface energy between fluid and the solid is\n\nsmaller than the sum of surface energies\n\nbetween solid-air, and fluid-air. Now there is\n\nattraction between the solid surface and the\n\nliquid. It can be directly measured\n\nexperimentaly as schematically shown in Fig.\n\n10.18. A flat vertical glass plate, below which a\n\nvessel of some liquid is kept, forms one arm of\n\nthe balance. The plate is balanced by weights\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS 267\n\non the other side, with its horizontal edge just\n\nover water. The vessel is raised slightly till the\n\nliquid just touches the glass plate and pulls it\n\ndown a little because of surface tension. Weights\n\nare added till the plate just clears water.\n\nFig. 10.18 Measuring Surface Tension.\n\nSuppose the additional weight required is W.\n\nThen from Eq. 10.22 and the discussion given\n\nthere, the surface tension of the liquid-air\n\ninterface is\n\nS\nla \n\n= (W/2l) = (mg/2l ) (10.23)\n\nwhere m is the extra mass and l is the length of\n\nthe plate edge. The subscript (la) emphasises\n\nthe fact that the liquid-air interface tension is\n\ninvolved.\n\n10.6.3 Angle of Contact\n\nThe surface of liquid near the plane of contact,\n\nwith another medium is in general curved. The\n\nangle between tangent to the liquid surface at\n\nthe point of contact and solid surface inside the\n\nliquid is termed as angle of contact. It is denoted\n\nby θ. It is different at interfaces of different pairs\nof liquids and solids. The value of θ determines\nwhether a liquid will spread on the surface of a\n\nsolid or it will form droplets on it. For example,\n\nwater forms droplets on lotus leaf as shown in\n\nFig. 10.19 (a) while spreads over a clean plastic\n\nplate as shown in Fig. 10.19(b).\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFig. 10.19 Different shapes of water drops with\ninterfacial tensions (a) on a lotus leaf (b)\n\non a clean plastic plate.\n\nWe consider the three interfacial tensions at\n\nall the three interfaces, liquid-air, solid-air and\n\nsolid-liquid denoted by S\nla\n, S\n\nsa\n and S\n\nsl \n, respectively\n\nas given in Fig. 10.19 (a) and (b). At the line of\n\ncontact, the surface forces between the three media\n\nmust be in equilibrium. From the Fig. 10.19(b) the\n\nfollowing relation is easily derived.\n\nS\nla\n cos θ  +  S\n\nsl\n =  S\n\nsa\n(10.24)\n\nThe angle of contact is an obtuse angle if\n\nS\nsl  \n\n> S\nla\n as in the case of water-leaf interface\n\nwhile it is an acute angle if S\nsl  \n\n< S\nla\n as in the\n\ncase of water-plastic interface. When θ is an\nobtuse angle then molecules of liquids are\n\nattracted strongly to themselves and weakly to\n\nthose of solid, it costs a lot of energy to create a\n\nliquid-solid surface, and liquid then does not\n\nwet the solid. This is what happens with water\n\non a waxy or oily surface, and with mercury on\n\nany surface. On the other hand, if the molecules\n\nof the liquid are strongly attracted to those of\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n268 PHYSICS\n\nthe solid, this will reduce S\nsl\n and therefore,\n\ncos θ may increase or θ may decrease. In this\ncase θ is an acute angle. This is what happens\nfor water on glass or on plastic and for kerosene\n\noil on virtually anything (it just spreads). Soaps,\n\ndetergents and dying substances are wetting\n\nagents. When they are added the angle of\n\ncontact becomes small so that these may\n\npenetrate well and become effective. Water\n\nproofing agents on the other hand are added to\n\ncreate a large angle of contact between the water\n\nand fibres.\n\n10.6.4 Drops and Bubbles\n\nOne consequence of surface tension is that free\n\nliquid drops and bubbles are spherical if effects\n\nof gravity can be neglected. You must have seen\n\nthis especially clearly in small drops just formed\n\nin a high-speed spray or jet, and in soap bubbles\n\nblown by most of us in childhood. Why are drops\n\nand bubbles spherical? What keeps soap\n\nbubbles stable?\n\nAs we have been saying repeatedly, a liquid-\n\nair interface has energy, so for a given volume\n\nthe surface with minimum energy is the one with\n\nthe least area. The sphere has this property.\n\nThough it is out of the scope of this book, but\n\nyou can check that a sphere is better than at\n\nleast a cube in this respect! So, if gravity and\n\nother forces (e.g. air resistance) were ineffective,\n\nliquid drops would be spherical.\n\nAnother interesting consequence of surface\n\ntension is that the pressure inside a spherical\n\ndrop Fig. 10.20(a) is more than the pressure\n\noutside. Suppose a spherical drop of radius r is\n\nin equilibrium. If its radius increase by ∆r. The\nextra surface energy is\n\n[4π(r + ∆r) 2- 4πr2] S\nla\n = 8πr ∆r S\n\nla\n(10.25)\n\nIf the drop is in equilibrium this energy cost is\n\nbalanced by the energy gain due to\n\nexpansion under the pressure difference (P\ni\n – P\n\no\n)\n\nbetween the inside of the bubble and the outside.\n\nThe work done is\n\nW = (P\ni\n – P\n\no\n) 4πr2∆r (10.26)\n\nso that\n\n(P\ni\n – P\n\no\n) = (2 S\n\nla\n/ r) (10.27)\n\nIn general, for a liquid-gas interface, the\n\nconvex side has a higher pressure than the\n\nconcave side. For example, an air bubble in a\n\nliquid, would have higher pressure inside it.\n\nSee Fig 10.20 (b).\n\nFig. 10.20 Drop, cavity and bubble of radius r.\n\nA bubble Fig 10.20 (c) differs from a drop\n\nand a cavity; in this it has two interfaces.\n\nApplying the above argument we have for a\n\nbubble\n\n (P\ni\n – P\n\no\n) = (4 S\n\nla\n/ r) (10.28)\n\nThis is probably why you have to blow hard,\n\nbut not too hard, to form a soap bubble. A little\n\nextra air pressure is needed inside!\n\n10.6.5 Capillary Rise\n\nOne consequence of the pressure difference\n\nacross a curved liquid-air interface is the well-\n\nknown effect that water rises up in a narrow\n\ntube in spite of gravity. The word capilla means\n\nhair in Latin; if the tube were hair thin, the rise\n\nwould be very large. To see this, consider a\n\nvertical capillary tube of circular cross section\n\n(radius a) inserted into an open vessel of water\n\n(Fig. 10.21). The contact angle between water\n\nFig. 10.21 Capillary rise, (a) Schematic picture of a\nnarrow tube immersed water.\n\n(b) Enlarged picture near interface.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS 269\n\nand glass is acute. Thus the surface of water in\n\nthe capillary is concave. This means that\n\nthere is a pressure difference between the\n\ntwo sides of the top surface. This is given by\n\n(P\ni\n – P\n\no\n) =(2S/r) = 2S/(a sec θ )\n\n= (2S/a) cos θ (10.29)\n\nThus the pressure of the water inside the\n\ntube, just at the meniscus (air-water interface)\n\nis less than the atmospheric pressure. Consider\n\nthe two points A and B in Fig. 10.21(a). They\n\nmust be at the same pressure, namely\n\nP\n0\n + h ρ  g = P\n\ni\n = P\n\nA\n(10.30)\n\nwhere ρρρρρ is the density of water and h is called\nthe capillary rise [Fig. 10.21(a)]. Using\n\nEq. (10.29) and (10.30) we have\n\nh ρ  g = (P\ni\n – P\n\n0\n) = (2S cos θ  )/a    (10.31)\n\nThe discussion here, and the Eqs. (10.26) and\n\n(10.27) make it clear that the capillary rise is\n\ndue to surface tension. It is larger, for a smaller\n\na. Typically it is of the order of a few cm for fine\n\ncapillaries. For example, if a = 0.05 cm, using\n\nthe value of surface tension for water (Table\n\n10.3), we find that\n\nh = 2S/(ρ  g a)\n\n  \n\n-1\n\n3 -3 -2 -4\n\n2×(0.073 N m )\n=\n\n(10 kg m ) (9.8 m s )(5 × 10 m)\n\n  = 2.98 ×  10–2 m = 2.98 cm\n\nNotice that if the liquid meniscus is convex,\n\nas for mercury, i.e., if cos θ is negative then from\nEq. (10.30) for example, it is clear that the liquid\n\nwill be lower in the capillary !\n\n10.6.6 Detergents and Surface Tension\n\nWe clean dirty clothes containing grease and oil\n\nstains sticking to cotton or other fabrics by\n\nadding detergents or soap to water, soaking\n\nclothes in it and shaking. Let us understand\n\nthis process better.\n\nWashing with water does not remove grease\n\nstains. This is because water does not wet greasy\n\ndirt; i.e., there is very little area of contact\n\nbetween them. If water could wet grease, the flow\n\nof water could carry some grease away.\n\nSomething of this sort is achieved through\n\ndetergents. The molecules of detergents are\n\nhairpin shaped, with one end attracted to water\nand the other to molecules of grease, oil or wax,\nthus tending to form water-oil interfaces. The result\nis shown in Fig. 10.22 as a sequence of figures.\n\nIn our language, we would say that addition\nof detergents, whose molecules attract at one\nend and say, oil on the other, reduces drastically\nthe surface tension S (water-oil). It may even\nbecome energetically favourable to form such\ninterfaces, i.e., globs of dirt surrounded by\ndetergents and then by water. This kind of\nprocess using surface active detergents or\nsurfactants is important not only for cleaning,\nbut also in recovering oil, mineral ores etc.\n\nFig. 10.22 Detergent action in terms of what\ndetergent molecules do.\n\n.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n270 PHYSICS\n\nt\n\nExample 10.11 The lower end of a capillary\ntube of diameter 2.00 mm is dipped 8.00\ncm below the surface of water in a beaker.\nWhat is the pressure required in the tube\nin order to blow a hemispherical bubble at\nits end in water? The surface tension of\nwater at temperature of the experiments is\n7.30×10-2 Nm-1. 1 atmospheric pressure =\n1.01 × 105 Pa, density of water = 1000 kg/m3,\ng = 9.80 m s-2. Also calculate the excess\npressure.\n\nAnswer The excess pressure in a bubble of gas\nin a liquid is given by 2S/r, where S is the\nsurface tension of the liquid-gas interface. You\nshould note there is only one liquid surface in\nthis case. (For a bubble of liquid in a gas, there\nare two liquid surfaces, so the formula for\n\nexcess pressure in that case is 4S/r.) The\nradius of the bubble is r. Now the pressure\noutside the bubble P\n\no\n equals atmospheric\n\npressure plus the pressure due to 8.00 cm of\nwater column. That is\n\nP\no\n = (1.01 × 105 Pa + 0.08 m × 1000 kg m–3\n\n    × 9.80 m s–2)\n    = 1.01784 × 105 Pa\n\nTherefore, the pressure inside the bubble is\n  P\n\ni \n = P\n\no\n + 2S/r\n\n= 1.01784 × 105 Pa + (2 × 7.3 × 10-2 Pa m/10-3 m)\n= (1.01784 + 0.00146) × 105  Pa\n= 1.02  × 105 Pa\n\nwhere the radius of the bubble is taken\nto be equal to the radius of the capillary tube,\nsince the bubble is hemispherical ! (The answer\nhas been rounded off to three significant\nfigures.) The excess pressure in the\nbubble is 146 Pa. t\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. The basic property of a fluid is that it can flow. The fluid does not have any\n\nresistance to change of its shape. Thus, the shape of a fluid is governed by the\n\nshape of its container.\n\n2. A liquid is incompressible and has a free surface of its own. A gas is compressible\n\nand it expands to occupy all the space available to it.\n\n3. If F is the normal force exerted by a fluid on an area A then the average pressure P\nav\n\nis defined as the ratio of the force to area\n\nA\n\nF\nP\n\nav\n=\n\n4. The unit of the pressure is the pascal (Pa). It is the same as N m-2. Other common\n\nunits of pressure are\n\n1 atm = 1.01×105 Pa\n\n1 bar = 105 Pa\n\n1 torr = 133 Pa = 0.133 kPa\n\n1 mm of Hg = 1 torr = 133 Pa\n\n5. Pascal’s law states that: Pressure in a fluid at rest is same at all points which are at\n\nthe same height. A change in pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted\n\nundiminished to every point of the fluid and the walls of the containing vessel.\n\n6. The pressure in a fluid varies with depth h according to the expression\n\nP = P\na \n+ ρgh\n\nwhere  ρ is the density of the fluid, assumed uniform.\n\n7. The volume of an incompressible fluid passing any point every second in a pipe of\n\nnon uniform crossection is the same in the steady flow.\n\nv A = constant ( v is the velocity and A is the area of crossection)\n\nThe equation is due to mass conservation in incompressible fluid flow.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS 271\n\n8. Bernoulli’s principle states that as we move along a streamline, the sum of the\n\npressure (P), the kinetic energy per unit volume (ρv2/2) and the potential energy per\nunit volume (ρgy) remains a constant.\nP + ρv2/2 + ρgy = constant\n\nThe equation is basically the conservation of energy applied to non viscuss fluid\n\nmotion in steady state. There is no fluid which have zero viscosity, so the above\n\nstatement is true only approximately. The viscosity is like friction and converts the\n\nkinetic energy to heat energy.\n\n9. Though shear strain in a fluid does not require shear stress, when a shear stress is\n\napplied to a fluid, the motion is generated which causes a shear strain growing\n\nwith time. The ratio of the shear stress to the time rate of shearing strain is known\n\nas coefficient of viscosity, η.\n\nwhere symbols have their usual meaning and are defined in the text.\n\n10. Stokes’ law states that the viscous drag force F on a sphere of radius a moving with\n\nvelocity v through a fluid of viscosity is, F = 6πηav.\n\n11. Surface tension is a force per unit length (or surface energy per unit area) acting in\n\nthe plane of interface between the liquid and the bounding surface. It is the extra\n\nenergy that the molecules at the interface have as compared to the interior.\n\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n\n1. Pressure is a scalar quantity. The definition of the pressure as “force per unit area”\nmay give one false impression that pressure is a vector. The “force” in the numerator of\nthe definition is the component of the force normal to the area upon which it is\nimpressed. While describing fluids as a concept, shift from particle and rigid body\nmechanics is required. We are concerned with properties that vary from point to point\nin the fluid.\n\n2.  One should not think of pressure of a fluid as being exerted only on a solid like the\nwalls of a container or a piece of solid matter immersed in the fluid. Pressure exists at\nall points in a fluid. An element of a fluid (such as the one shown in Fig. 10.2) is in\nequilibrium because the pressures exerted on the various faces are equal.\n\n3. The expression for pressure\nP = P\n\na \n+ ρgh\n\nholds true if fluid is incompressible. Practically speaking it holds for liquids, which\nare largely incompressible and hence  is a constant with height.\n\n4. The gauge pressure is the difference of the actual pressure and the atmospheric pressure.\nP – P\n\na \n= P\n\ng\n\nMany pressure-measuring devices measure the gauge pressure. These include the tyre\npressure gauge and the blood pressure gauge (sphygmomanometer).\n\n5. A streamline is a map of fluid flow. In a steady flow two streamlines do not intersect as\nit means that the fluid particle will have two possible velocities at the point.\n\n6. Bernoulli’s principle does not hold in presence of viscous drag on the fluid. The work\ndone by this dissipative viscous force must be taken into account in this case, and P\n\n2\n\n[Fig. 10.9] will be lower than the value given by Eq. (10.12).\n7. As the temperature rises the atoms of the liquid become more mobile and the coefficient\n\nof viscosity, η  falls. In a gas the temperature rise increases the random motion of\natoms and η  increases.\n\n8. Surface tension arises due to excess potential energy of the molecules on the surface\nin comparison to their potential energy in the interior. Such a surface energy is present\nat the interface separating two substances at least one of which is a fluid. It is not the\nproperty of a single fluid alone.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n272 PHYSICS\n\nEXERCISES\n\n10.1 Explain why\n(a) The blood pressure in humans is greater at the feet than at the brain\n(b) Atmospheric pressure at a height of about 6 km decreases to nearly half of\n\nits value at the sea level, though the height of the atmosphere is more than\n100 km\n\n(c) Hydrostatic pressure is a scalar quantity even though pressure is force\ndivided by area.\n\n10.2 Explain why\n(a) The angle of contact of mercury with glass is obtuse, while that of water\n\nwith glass is acute.\n(b) Water on a clean glass surface tends to spread out while mercury on the\n\nsame surface tends to form drops.

This placed a number of demands on the circulatory system. The\nvenous system that returns blood from the lower extremities to the heart underwent changes. You\nwill recall that veins are blood vessels through which blood returns to the heart. Humans and\nanimals such as the giraffe have adapted to the problem of moving blood upward against gravity.\nBut animals such as snakes, rats and rabbits will die if held upwards, since the blood remains in\nthe lower extremities and the venous system is unable to move it towards the heart.\n\nFig. 10.26 Schematic view of the gauge pressures in the arteries in various parts of the human body while\nstanding or lying down. The pressures shown are averaged over a heart cycle.\n\nFigure 10.26 shows the average pressures observed in the arteries at various points in the human body.\nSince viscous effects are small, we can use Bernoulli’s equation, Eq. (10.13),\n\n21\nConstant\n\n2\nP v gy+ ρ + ρ =\n\nto understand these pressure values. The kinetic energy term (ρ  v2/2) can be ignored since the velocities in\nthe three arteries are small (≈  0.1 m s–1) and almost constant. Hence the gauge pressures at the brain P\n\nB\n,\n\nthe heart P\nH\n, and the foot P\n\nF \nare related by\n\nP\nF\n = P\n\nH\n +  ρ g h\n\nH\n = P\n\nB\n + ρ g h\n\nB\n(10.34)\n\nwhere ρ is the density of blood.\nTypical values of the heights to the heart and the brain are h\n\nH\n = 1.3 m and h\n\nB\n = 1.7 m. Taking\n\nρ = 1.06 ×  103 kg m–3 we obtain that P\nF  \n\n= 26.8 kPa (kilopascals) and\n \nP\n\nB\n = 9.3 kPa given that P\n\nH\n = 13.3 kPa.\n\nThus the pressures in the lower and upper parts of the body are so different when a person is standing,\nbut are almost equal when he is lying down. As mentioned in the text the units for pressure more\ncommonly employed in medicine and physiology are torr and mm of Hg. 1 mm of Hg = 1 torr = 0.133 kPa.\nThus the average pressure at the heart is P\n\nH\n = 13.3 kPa = 100 mm of Hg.\n\nThe human body is a marvel of nature. The veins in the lower extremities are equipped with valves,\nwhich open when blood flows towards the heart and close if it tends to drain down. Also, blood is returned\nat least partially by the pumping action associated with breathing and by the flexing of the skeletal muscles\nduring walking. This explains why a soldier who is required to stand at attention may faint because of\ninsufficient return of the blood to the heart. Once he is made to lie down, the pressures become equalized\nand he regains consciousness.\n\nAn instrument called the sphygmomanometer usually measures the blood pressure of humans. It is a\nfast, painless and non-invasive technique and gives the doctor a reliable idea about the patient’s health.\nThe measurement process is shown in Fig. 10.27. There are two reasons why the upper arm is used. First,\nit is at the same level as the heart and measurements here give values close to that at the heart. Secondly,\nthe upper arm contains a single bone and makes the artery there (called the brachial artery) easy to\ncompress. We have all measured pulse rates by placing our fingers over the wrist. Each pulse takes a little\nless than a second. During each pulse the pressure in the heart and the  circulatory  system goes through a\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS 277\n\nmaximum as the blood is pumped by the heart (systolic  pressure) and a minimum as the heart relaxes\n(diastolic pressure). The sphygmomanometer is a device, which measures these extreme pressures. It\nworks on the principle that blood flow in the brachial (upper arm) artery can be made to go from\nlaminar to turbulent by suitable compression. Turbulent flow is dissipative, and its sound can be\npicked up on the stethoscope.\n\nThe gauge pressure in an air sack wrapped around the upper arm is measured using a manometer or a\n\ndial pressure gauge (Fig. 10.27). The pressure in the sack is first increased till the brachial artery is closed.\n\nThe pressure in the sack is then slowly reduced while a stethoscope placed just below the sack is used to\nlisten to noises arising in the brachial artery. When\n\nthe pressure is just below the systolic (peak)\npressure, the artery opens briefly. During this brief\n\nperiod, the blood velocity in the highly constricted\n\nartery is high and turbulent and hence noisy. The\n\nresulting noise is heard as a tapping sound on the\nstethoscope. When the pressure in the sack is\n\nlowered further, the artery remains open for a longer\n\nportion of the heart cycle. Nevertheless, it remains\n\nclosed during the diastolic (minimum pressure)\nphase of the heartbeat. Thus the duration of the\n\ntapping sound is longer. When the pressure in the\nsack reaches the diastolic pressure the artery is\n\nopen during the entire heart cycle. The flow is\n\nhowever, still turbulent and noisy. But instead of a\n\ntapping sound we hear a steady, continuous roar\n\non the stethoscope.\n\nThe blood pressure of a patient is presented as the ratio of systolic/diastolic pressures. For a resting\n\nhealthy adult it is typically 120/80 mm of Hg (120/80 torr). Pressures above 140/90 require medical\n\nattention and advice. High blood pressures may seriously damage the heart, kidney and other organs and\n\nmust be controlled.\n\nFig. 10.27 Blood pressure measurement using the\nsphygmomanometer and stethoscope.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 10.pmd\n\n\nCHAPTER TEN\n\nMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS\n\n10.1 INTRODUCTION\n\nIn this chapter, we shall study  some common physical\nproperties of liquids and gases. Liquids and gases can  flow\nand are therefore, called  fluids.  It is this property that\ndistinguishes liquids and gases from solids in a basic way.\n\nFluids are everywhere around us. Earth has an envelop of\nair and two-thirds of its surface is covered with water.  Water\nis not only necessary for our existence; every mammalian\nbody constitute mostly of water. All the  processes occurring\nin living beings including plants are mediated by fluids. Thus\nunderstanding the behaviour and properties of fluids is\nimportant.\n\nHow are fluids different from solids? What is common in\nliquids and gases? Unlike  a solid, a fluid has no definite\nshape of its own. Solids and liquids have a fixed volume,\nwhereas a gas fills the entire volume of its container. We\nhave learnt in the previous chapter that the volume of solids\ncan be changed by stress. The volume of solid, liquid or gas\ndepends on the stress or pressure acting on it. When we\ntalk about fixed volume of solid or liquid, we mean its volume\nunder atmospheric pressure. The difference between gases\nand solids or liquids is that for solids or liquids the change\nin volume due to  change of external pressure is rather small.\nIn other words solids and liquids have much lower\ncompressibility as compared to gases.\n\nShear stress can change the shape of a solid keeping its\nvolume fixed. The key property of fluids is that they offer\nvery little resistance to shear stress; their shape changes by\napplication of very small shear stress. The shearing stress\nof fluids is about million times smaller than that of solids.\n\n10.2  PRESSURE\n\nA sharp needle when pressed against our skin pierces it. Our\nskin, however, remains intact when a blunt object with a\nwider contact area (say the back of a spoon) is pressed against\nit with the same force. If an elephant were to step on a man’s\nchest, his ribs would crack. A circus performer across whose\n\n10.1 Introduction\n\n10.2 Pressure\n\n10.3 Streamline flow\n\n10.4 Bernoulli’s principle\n\n10.5 Viscosity\n\n10.6 Surface tension\n\nSummary\n\nPoints to ponder\n\nExercises\n\nAdditional exercises\n\nAppendix\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nchest a large, light but strong wooden plank is\nplaced first, is saved from this accident. Such\neveryday experiences convince us that both the\nforce and its coverage area are important. Smaller\nthe area on which the force acts, greater is the\nimpact. This impact is known as pressure.\n\nWhen an object is submerged in a fluid at\nrest, the fluid exerts a force on its surface. This\nforce is always normal to the object’s surface.\nThis is so because if there were a component of\nforce parallel to the surface, the object will also\nexert a force on the fluid parallel to it; as a\nconsequence of Newton’s third law. This force\nwill cause the fluid to flow parallel to the surface.\nSince the fluid is at rest, this cannot happen.\nHence, the force exerted by the fluid at rest has\nto be perpendicular to the surface in contact\nwith it. This is shown in Fig.10.1(a).\n\nThe normal force exerted by the fluid at a point\nmay be measured. An idealised form of one such\npressure-measuring device is shown in Fig.\n10.1(b). It consists of an evacuated chamber with\na spring that is calibrated to measure the force\nacting on the piston. This device is placed at a\npoint inside the fluid. The inward force exerted\nby the fluid on the piston is balanced by the\noutward spring force and is thereby measured.\n\nIf F is the magnitude of this normal force on the\npiston of area A then the average pressure P\n\nav\n\nis defined as the normal force acting per unit\narea.\n\nP\nF\n\nA\nav =              (10.1)\n\nIn principle, the piston area can be made\narbitrarily small. The pressure is then defined\nin a limiting sense as\n\nP = \nlim\n\n∆A 0→\n∆\n∆\n\nF\n\nA\n(10.2)\n\nPressure is a scalar quantity. We remind the\nreader that it is the component of the force\nnormal to the area under consideration and not\nthe (vector) force that appears in the numerator\nin Eqs. (10.1) and (10.2). Its dimensions are\n[ML–1T–2]. The SI unit of pressure is N m–2. It has\nbeen named as pascal (Pa) in honour of the\nFrench scientist Blaise Pascal (1623-1662) who\ncarried out pioneering studies on fluid pressure.\nA common unit of pressure is the atmosphere\n(atm), i.e. the pressure exerted by the\natmosphere at sea level (1 atm = 1.013 ×  105 Pa).\n\nAnother quantity, that is indispensable in\ndescribing fluids, is the density ρ. For a fluid of\nmass m occupying volume V,\n\nρ =\nm\n\nV\n(10.3)\n\nThe dimensions of density are [ML–3]. Its SI\nunit is kg m–3. It is a positive scalar quantity. A\nliquid is largely incompressible and its density\nis therefore, nearly constant at all pressures.\nGases, on the other hand exhibit a large\nvariation in densities with pressure.\n\nThe density of water at 4\no\nC (277 K) is\n\n1.0 ×  103 kg m–3. The relative density of a\nsubstance is the ratio of its density to the\ndensity of water at 4oC. It is a dimensionless\npositive scalar quantity. For example the relative\ndensity of aluminium is 2.7. Its density is\n2.7 ×  103 kg m–3.  The densities of some common\nfluids are displayed in Table 10.1.\n\nTable 10.1 Densities of some common fluids\n\nat STP*(a) (b)\nFig. 10.1 (a) The force exerted by the liquid in the\n\nbeaker on the submerged object or on the\n\nwalls is normal (perpendicular) to the\n\nsurface at all points.\n\n(b) An idealised device for measuring\n\npressure.\n\n* STP means standard temperature (00C) and 1 atm pressure.\n\nMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS 251\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n252 PHYSICS\n\nt\n\nExample 10.1   The two thigh bones\n(femurs), each of cross-sectional area10 cm2\n\nsupport the upper part of a human body of\nmass 40 kg. Estimate the average pressure\nsustained by the femurs.\n\nAnswer   Total cross-sectional area of the\nfemurs is A = 2 ×  10 cm2 = 20 ×  10–4 m2. The\nforce acting on them is F = 40 kg wt = 400 N\n(taking g = 10 m s–2). This force is acting\nvertically down and hence, normally on the\nfemurs. Thus, the average pressure is\n\n25\nm N 10  2    \n\n−×==\nA\n\nF\nPav                             t\n\n10.2.1 Pascal’s Law\n\nThe French scientist Blaise Pascal observed that\nthe pressure in a fluid at rest is the same at all\npoints if they are at the same height. This fact\nmay be demonstrated in a simple way.\n\nFig. 10.2 shows an element in the interior of\na fluid at rest. This element ABC-DEF is in the\nform of a right-angled prism. In principle, this\nprismatic element is very small so that every\npart of it can be considered at the same depth\nfrom the liquid surface and therefore, the effect\nof the gravity is the same at all these points.\nBut for clarity we have enlarged this element.\nThe forces on this element are those exerted by\nthe rest of the fluid and they must be normal to\nthe surfaces of the element as discussed above.\nThus, the fluid exerts pressures P\n\na\n, P\n\nb \nand P\n\nc\n on\n\nthis element of area corresponding to the normal\nforces F\n\na\n, F\n\nb\n and F\n\nc\n as shown in Fig. 10.2 on the\n\nfaces BEFC, ADFC and ADEB denoted by A\na\n, A\n\nb\n\nand A\nc\n respectively. Then\n\nF\nb \nsinθ = F\n\nc\n, F\n\nb \ncosθ = F\n\na\n(by equilibrium)\n\nA\nb \nsinθ = A\n\nc\n, A\n\nb \ncosθ = A\n\na\n(by geometry)\n\nThus,\n\n;b c a b c a\nb c a\n\nF F F\nP P P\n\nA A A\n= = = = (10.4)\n\nHence, pressure exerted is same in all\ndirections in a fluid at rest. It again reminds us\nthat like other types of stress, pressure is not a\nvector quantity. No direction can be assigned\nto it.  The force against any area within (or\nbounding) a fluid at rest and under pressure is\nnormal to the area, regardless of the orientation\nof the area.\n\nNow consider a fluid element in the form of a\nhorizontal bar of uniform cross-section. The bar\nis in equilibrium. The horizontal forces exerted\nat its two ends  must be balanced or the\npressure at the two ends should be equal. This\nproves that for a liquid in equilibrium the\npressure is same at all points in a horizontal\nplane. Suppose the pressure were not equal in\ndifferent parts of the fluid, then there would be\na flow as the  fluid will have some net force\nacting on it. Hence in the absence of flow the\npressure in the fluid must be same everywhere\nin a horizontal plane.\n\n10.2.2 Variation of Pressure with Depth\n\nConsider a fluid at rest in a container. In\nFig. 10.3 point 1 is at height h above a point 2.\nThe pressures at points 1 and 2 are P\n\n1\n and P\n\n2\n\nrespectively. Consider a cylindrical element of\nfluid having area of base A and height h. As the\nfluid is at rest the resultant horizontal forces\nshould be zero and the resultant vertical forces\nshould balance the weight of the element. The\nforces acting in the vertical direction are due to\nthe fluid pressure at the top (P\n\n1\nA) acting\n\ndownward, at the bottom (P\n2\nA) acting upward.\n\nIf mg is weight of the fluid in the cylinder we\nhave\n\n(P\n2 \n\n− P\n1\n) A = mg (10.5)\n\nNow, if ρ is the mass density of the fluid, we\nhave the mass of fluid to be m = ρV= ρhA so\nthat\n\nP\n2 \n\n−\n \nP\n\n1\n=  ρgh (10.6)\n\nFig. 10.2 Proof of Pascal’s law. ABC-DEF is an\nelement of the interior of a fluid at rest.\n\nThis element is in the form of a right-\n\nangled prism. The element is small so that\n\nthe effect of gravity can be ignored, but it\n\nhas been enlarged for the sake of clarity.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS 253\n\nt\n\nFig.10.3 Fluid under gravity. The effect of gravity is\nillustrated through pressure on a vertical\n\ncylindrical column.\n\nPressure difference depends on the vertical\n\ndistance h between the points (1 and 2), mass\n\ndensity of the fluid ρ and acceleration due to\ngravity g. If the point 1 under discussion is\n\nshifted to the top of the  fluid (say, water), which\n\nis open to the atmosphere, P\n1\n may be replaced\n\nby atmospheric pressure (P\na\n) and we replace P\n\n2\n\nby P. Then Eq. (10.6) gives\n\nP =\n \nP\n\na \n+ ρgh (10.7)\n\nThus, the pressure P, at depth below the\n\nsurface of a liquid open to the atmosphere is\n\ngreater than atmospheric pressure by an\n\namount ρgh. The excess of pressure, P −\n \nP\n\na\n, at\n\ndepth h is called a gauge pressure at that point.\n\nThe area of the cylinder is not appearing in\n\nthe expression of absolute pressure in Eq. (10.7).\n\nThus, the height of the fluid column is important\n\nand not cross-sectional or base area or the shape\n\nof the container. The liquid pressure is the same\n\nat all points at the same horizontal level (same\n\ndepth).  The result is appreciated through the\n\nexample of hydrostatic paradox. Consider three\n\nvessels A, B and C  [Fig.10.4] of different shapes.\n\nThey are connected at the bottom by a horizontal\n\npipe. On filling with water, the level in the three\n\nvessels is the same, though they hold different\n\namounts of water. This is so because water at\n\nthe bottom has the same pressure below each\n\nsection of the vessel.\n\nFig 10.4 Illustration of hydrostatic paradox. The\nthree vessels A, B and C contain different\n\namounts of liquids, all upto the same\n\nheight.\n\nExample 10.2 What is the pressure on a\nswimmer 10 m below the surface of a lake?\n\nAnswer Here\nh = 10 m and ρ = 1000 kg m-3. Take g = 10 m s–2\n\nFrom Eq. (10.7)\nP =\n\n \nP\n\na \n+ ρgh\n\n   = 1.01 × 105 Pa + 1000 kg m–3 × 10 m s–2 × 10 m\n   = 2.01 × 105 Pa\n    ≈ 2 atm\n\nThis is a 100% increase in pressure from\nsurface level. At a depth of 1 km, the increase\nin pressure is 100 atm! Submarines are designed\nto withstand such enormous pressures.   t\n\n10.2.3 Atmospheric Pressure and\nGauge Pressure\n\nThe pressure of the atmosphere at any point is\nequal to the weight of a column of air of unit\ncross-sectional area extending from that point\nto the top of the atmosphere. At sea level, it is\n1.013 × 105 Pa (1 atm). Italian scientist\nEvangelista Torricelli (1608–1647) devised for\nthe first time a method for measuring\natmospheric pressure. A long glass tube closed\nat one end and filled with mercury is inverted\ninto a trough of mercury as shown in Fig.10.5 (a).\nThis device is known as ‘mercury barometer’.\nThe space above the mercury column in the tube\ncontains only mercury vapour whose pressure\nP is so small  that it may be neglected. Thus,\nthe pressure at Point A=0. The pressure inside\nthe coloumn at Point B must be the same as the\npressure at Point C, which is atmospheric\npressure, Pa.\n\nP\na \n= ρgh (10.8)\n\nwhere ρ is the density of mercury and h is the\nheight of the mercury column in the tube.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n254 PHYSICS\n\nt\n\nt\n\nIn the experiment it is found that the mercury\ncolumn in the barometer has a height of about\n76 cm at sea level equivalent to one atmosphere\n(1 atm). This can also be obtained using the\nvalue of ρ in Eq. (10.8). A common way of stating\npressure is in terms of cm or mm of mercury\n(Hg). A pressure equivalent of 1 mm is called a\ntorr (after Torricelli).\n\n1 torr = 133 Pa.\nThe mm of Hg and torr are used in medicine\n\nand physiology. In meteorology, a common unit\nis the bar and millibar.\n\n1 bar = 105 Pa\nAn open tube manometer is a useful\n\ninstrument for measuring pressure differences.\nIt consists of a U-tube containing a suitable\nliquid i.e., a low density liquid (such as oil) for\nmeasuring small pressure differences and a\nhigh density liquid (such as mercury) for large\npressure differences. One end of the tube is open\nto the atmosphere and the other end is\nconnected to the system whose pressure we want\nto measure [see Fig. 10.5 (b)]. The pressure P at\nA is equal to pressure at point B. What we\nnormally measure is the gauge pressure, which\nis P − P\n\na\n, given by Eq. (10.8) and is proportional\n\nto manometer height h.\n\nPressure is same at the same level on both\nsides of the U-tube containing a fluid. For\nliquids, the density varies very little over wide\nranges in pressure and temperature and we can\ntreat it safely as a constant for our present\npurposes. Gases on the other hand, exhibits\nlarge variations of densities with changes in\npressure and temperature. Unlike gases, liquids\nare, therefore, largely treated as incompressible.\n\nExample 10.3 The density of the\natmosphere at sea level is 1.29 kg/m3.\nAssume that it does not change with\naltitude. Then how high would the\natmosphere extend?\n\nAnswer We use Eq. (10.7)\n\nρgh  =  1.29 kg m–3 × 9.8 m s2 × h  m = 1.01 × 105 Pa\n\n∴ h = 7989 m ≈ 8 km\nIn reality the density of air decreases with\n\nheight. So does the value of g. The atmospheric\n\ncover extends with decreasing pressure over\n\n100 km. We should also note that the sea level\n\natmospheric pressure is not always 760 mm of\n\nHg.

Consider a horizontal cylinder with a\n\npiston and three vertical tubes at different\n\npoints [Fig. 10.6 (a)]. The pressure in the\n\nhorizontal cylinder is indicated by the height of\n\nliquid column in the vertical tubes. It is necessarily\n\nthe same in all. If we push the piston, the fluid level\n\nrises in all the tubes, again reaching the same level\nin each one of them.\n\n     This indicates that when the pressure  on the\ncylinder was increased, it was distributed\nuniformly throughout. We can say  whenever\nexternal pressure is applied on any part of a\nfluid contained in a vessel, it is transmitted\nundiminished and equally in all directions.\nThis is another form of the Pascal’s law and it\nhas many applications in daily life.\n\nA number of devices, such as hydraulic lift\nand hydraulic brakes, are based on the Pascal’s\nlaw. In these devices, fluids are used for\ntransmitting pressure. In a hydraulic lift, as\nshown in Fig. 10.6 (b), two pistons are separated\nby the space filled with a liquid. A piston of small\ncross-section A\n\n1\n is used to exert a force F\n\n1\n directly\n\non the liquid. The pressure P = \n1\n\n1\n\nF\n\nA\n is\n\ntransmitted throughout the liquid to the larger\ncylinder attached with a larger piston of area A\n\n2\n,\n\nwhich results in an upward force of P × A\n2\n.\n\nTherefore, the piston is capable of supporting a\nlarge force (large weight of, say a car, or a truck,\n\nArchemedes’ Principle\nFluid appears to provide partial support to the objects placed in it.  When a body is wholly or partially\nimmersed in a fluid at rest, the fluid exerts pressure on the surface of the body in contact with the\nfluid. The pressure is greater on lower surfaces of the body than on the upper surfaces as pressure in\na fluid increases with depth. The resultant of all the forces is an upward force called buoyant force.\nSuppose that a cylindrical body is immersed in the fluid. The upward force on the bottom of the body\nis more than the downward force on its top. The fluid exerts a resultant upward force or buoyant force\n\non the body equal to (P\n2 \n– P\n\n1\n) ×××××      A (Fig. 10.3). We have seen in equation 10.4 that (P\n\n2\n-P\n\n1\n)A = ρghA. Now,\n\nhA is the volume of the solid and  ρhA is the weight of an equivaliant volume of the fluid. (P\n2\n-P\n\n1\n)A = mg.\n\nThus, the upward force exerted is equal to the weight of the displaced fluid.\nThe result holds true irrespective of the shape of the object and here cylindrical object is considered\n\nonly for convenience. This is Archimedes’ principle. For totally immersed objects the volume of the\nfluid displaced by the object is equal to its own volume. If the density of the immersed object is more\nthan that of the fluid, the object will sink as the weight of the body is more than the upward thrust. If\nthe density of the object is less than that of the fluid, it floats in the fluid partially submerged. To\ncalculate the volume submerged, suppose the total volume of the object is V\n\ns\n and  a part V\n\np \nof it is\n\nsubmerged  in the fluid.  Then, the upward force which is the weight of the displaced fluid is ρ\nf\ngV\n\np\n,\n\nwhich must equal the weight of the body; ρ\ns\ngV\n\ns\n = ρ\n\nf\ngV\n\np\nor  ρ\n\ns\n/ρ\n\nf\n = V\n\np\n/V\n\ns \n The apparent weight of the\n\nfloating body is zero.\nThis principle can be summarised as; ‘the loss of weight of a body submerged (partially or fully) in\n\na fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced’.\n\nFig 10.6  (a) Whenever external pressure is applied\n   on any part of a fluid in a vessel, it is\n\nequally transmitted in all directions.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n256 PHYSICS\n\nt\n\nt\n\nplaced on the platform) F\n2 \n\n= PA\n2 \n\n= \n1 2\n\n1\n\nF A\n\nA\n.

When we apply a little force\non the pedal with our foot the master piston\n\nArchimedes was a Greek philosopher, mathematician, scientist and engineer. He\ninvented the catapult and devised a system of pulleys and levers to handle heavy\nloads. The king of his native city Syracuse, Hiero II, asked him to determine if his gold\ncrown was alloyed with some cheaper metal, such as silver without damaging the crown.\nThe partial loss of weight he experienced while lying in his bathtub suggested a solution\n\nto him. According to legend, he ran naked through the streets of Syracuse, exclaiming “Eureka,\neureka!”, which means “I have found it, I have found it!”\n\nArchimedes (287–212 B.C.)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS 257\n\nmoves inside the master cylinder, and the\npressure caused is transmitted through the\nbrake oil to act on a piston of larger area. A large\nforce acts on the piston and is pushed down\nexpanding the brake shoes against brake lining.\nIn this way, a small force on the pedal produces\na large retarding force on the wheel. An\nimportant advantage of the system is that the\npressure set up by pressing pedal is transmitted\nequally to all cylinders attached to the four\nwheels so that the braking effort is equal on\nall wheels.\n\n10.3  STREAMLINE FLOW\n\nSo far we have studied fluids at rest. The study\nof the fluids in motion is known as fluid\ndynamics. When a water tap is turned on slowly,\n\nthe water flow is smooth initially, but loses its\n\nsmoothness when the speed of the outflow is\n\nincreased. In studying the motion of fluids, we\n\nfocus our attention on what is happening to\n\nvarious fluid particles at a particular point in\nspace at a particular time. The flow of the fluid\n\nis said to be steady if at any given point, the\nvelocity of each passing fluid particle remains\n\nconstant in time. This does not mean that the\n\nvelocity at different points in space is same. The\n\nvelocity of a particular particle may change as it\nmoves from one point to another. That is, at some\n\nother point the particle may have a different\n\nvelocity, but every other particle which passes\n\nthe second point behaves exactly as the previous\n\nparticle that has just passed that point. Each\n\nparticle follows a smooth path, and the paths of\nthe particles do not cross each other.\n\nFig. 10.7 The meaning of streamlines. (a) A typical\ntrajectory of a fluid particle.\n\n(b) A region of streamline flow.\n\nThe path taken by a fluid particle under a\nsteady flow is a streamline. It is defined as a\ncurve whose tangent at any point is in the\ndirection of the fluid velocity at that point.\nConsider the path of a particle as shown in\nFig.10.7 (a), the curve describes how a fluid\nparticle moves with time. The curve PQ is like a\npermanent map of fluid flow, indicating how the\nfluid streams. No two streamlines can cross, for\nif they do, an oncoming fluid particle can go\neither one way or the other and the flow would\nnot be steady. Hence, in steady flow, the map of\nflow is stationary in time. How do we draw closely\nspaced streamlines ? If we intend to show\nstreamline of every flowing particle, we would\nend up with a continuum of lines. Consider planes\nperpendicular to the direction of fluid flow e.g.,\nat three points P, R and Q in Fig.10.7 (b). The\nplane pieces are so chosen that their boundaries\nbe determined by the same set of streamlines.\nThis means that number of fluid particles\ncrossing the surfaces as indicated at P, R and Q\nis the same. If area of cross-sections at these\npoints are A\n\nP\n,A\n\nR\n and A\n\nQ\n and speeds of fluid\n\nparticles are v\nP\n, v\n\nR\n and v\n\nQ\n, then mass of fluid\n\n∆m\nP\n crossing at A\n\nP\n in a small interval of time ∆t\n\nis ρ\nP\nA\n\nP\nv\n\nP \n∆t. Similarly mass of fluid ∆m\n\nR\n flowing\n\nor crossing at A\nR\n in a small interval of time ∆t is\n\nρ\nR\nA\n\nR\nv\n\nR \n∆t and mass of fluid  ∆m\n\nQ\n is ρ\n\nQ\nA\n\nQ\nv\n\nQ \n∆t\n\ncrossing at A\nQ\n. The mass of liquid flowing out\n\nequals the mass flowing in, holds in all cases.\nTherefore,\n\nρ\nP\nA\n\nP\nv\n\nP\n∆t = ρ\n\nR\nA\n\nR\nv\n\nR\n∆t = ρ\n\nQ\nA\n\nQ\nv\n\nQ\n∆t (10.9)\n\nFor flow of incompressible fluids\nρ\n\nP\n = ρ\n\nR\n = ρ\n\nQ\n\nEquation (10.9) reduces to\nA\n\nP\nv\n\nP\n = A\n\nR\nv\n\nR\n = A\n\nQ\nv\n\nQ\n(10.10)\n\nwhich is called the equation of continuity and\nit is a statement of conservation of mass in flow\nof incompressible fluids. In general\n\nAv = constant (10.11)\nAv gives the volume flux or flow rate and\n\nremains constant throughout the pipe of flow.\nThus, at narrower portions where the\nstreamlines are closely spaced, velocity\nincreases and its vice versa. From (Fig 10.7b) it\nis clear that A\n\nR  \n> A\n\nQ \nor   v\n\nR\n <  v\n\nQ\n, the fluid is\n\naccelerated while passing from R to Q. This is\nassociated with a change in pressure in fluid\nflow in horizontal pipes.\n\nSteady flow is achieved at low flow speeds.\nBeyond a limiting value, called critical speed,\nthis flow loses steadiness and becomes\nturbulent. One sees this when a fast flowing\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n258 PHYSICS\n\nstream encounters rocks, small foamy\nwhirlpool-like regions called ‘white water\nrapids are formed.\n\nFigure 10.8 displays streamlines for some\ntypical flows. For example, Fig. 10.8(a) describes\na laminar flow where the velocities at different\npoints in the fluid may have dif ferent\nmagnitudes but their directions are parallel.\nFigure 10.8 (b) gives a sketch of turbulent flow.\n\nFig. 10.8 (a) Some streamlines for fluid flow.\n(b) A jet of air striking a flat plate placed\n\nperpendicular to it. This is an example\n\nof turbulent flow.\n\n10.4  BERNOULLI’S PRINCIPLE\n\nFluid flow is a complex phenomenon. But we\ncan obtain some useful properties for steady\nor streamline flows using the conservation\nof energy.\n\nConsider a fluid moving in a pipe of varying\ncross-sectional area. Let the pipe be at varying\nheights as shown in Fig. 10.9. We now suppose\nthat an incompressible fluid is flowing through\nthe pipe in a steady flow. Its velocity must\nchange as a consequence of equation of\ncontinuity. A force is required to produce this\nacceleration, which is   caused by the fluid\nsurrounding it, the pressure must be different\nin different regions. Bernoulli’s equation is a\ngeneral expression that relates the pressure\ndifference between two points in a pipe to both\nvelocity changes (kinetic energy change) and\nelevation (height) changes (potential energy\n\nchange). The Swiss Physicist Daniel Bernoulli\ndeveloped this relationship in 1738.\n\nConsider the flow at two regions 1 (i.e., BC)\nand 2 (i.e., DE). Consider the fluid initially lying\nbetween B and D. In an infinitesimal time\ninterval ∆t, this fluid would have moved. Suppose\nv\n\n1\n is the speed at B and v\n\n2\n at D, then fluid initially\n\nat B has moved a distance v\n1\n∆t to C (v\n\n1\n∆t is small\n\nenough to assume constant cross-section along\nBC). In the same interval ∆t the fluid initially at\nD moves to E, a distance equal to v\n\n2\n∆t. Pressures\n\nP\n1\n and P\n\n2\n act as shown on the plane faces of\n\nareas A\n1\n and A\n\n2\n binding the two regions. The\n\nwork done on the fluid at left end (BC) is W\n1\n =\n\nP\n1\nA\n\n1\n(v\n\n1\n∆t) = P\n\n1\n∆V. Since the same volume ∆V\n\npasses through both the regions (from the\nequation of continuity) the work done by the fluid\nat the other end (DE) is W\n\n2\n = P\n\n2\nA\n\n2\n(v\n\n2\n∆t) = P\n\n2\n∆V or,\n\nthe work done on the fluid is  –P\n2\n∆V. So the total\n\nwork done on the fluid is\nW\n\n1\n – W\n\n2 \n=  (P\n\n1\n− P\n\n2\n) ∆V\n\nPart of this work goes into changing the kinetic\nenergy of the fluid, and part goes into changing\nthe gravitational potential energy.

The fluid in a\n\nsection of length v\n1\n∆t moves to the section\n\nof length v\n2\n∆t in time ∆t.\n\nIn words, the Bernoulli’s relation may be\nstated as follows: As we move along a streamline\nthe sum of the pressure (P ), the kinetic energy\n\nper unit volume \nρv2\n\n2\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8\uf8f7  and the potential energy\n\nper unit volume (ρgh) remains a constant.\nNote that in applying the energy conservation\n\nprinciple, there is an assumption that no energy\nis lost due to friction. But in fact, when fluids\nflow, some energy does get lost due to internal\nfriction. This arises due to the fact that in a\nfluid flow, the different layers of the fluid flow\nwith different velocities. These layers exert\nfrictional forces on each other resulting in a loss\nof energy. This property of the fluid is called\nviscosity and is discussed in more detail in a\nlater section. The lost kinetic energy of the fluid\ngets converted into heat energy. Thus,\nBernoulli’s equation ideally applies to fluids with\n\nzero viscosity or non-viscous fluids. Another\n\nrestriction on application of Bernoulli theorem\n\nis that the fluids must be incompressible, as\n\nthe elastic energy of the fluid is also not taken\n\ninto consideration. In practice, it has a large\n\nnumber of useful applications and can help\n\nexplain a wide variety of phenomena for low\n\nviscosity incompressible fluids.  Bernoulli’s\n\nequation also does not hold for non-steady or\n\nturbulent flows, because in that situation\n\nvelocity and pressure are constantly fluctuating\n\nin time.\n\nWhen a fluid is at rest i.e., its velocity is zero\n\neverywhere, Bernoulli’s equation becomes\n\nP\n1\n + ρgh\n\n1\n = P\n\n2\n + ρgh\n\n2\n\n(P\n1\n− P\n\n2\n) = ρg (h\n\n2 \n− h\n\n1\n)\n\nwhich is same as Eq.

Torricelli\ndiscovered that the speed of efflux from an open\ntank is given by a formula identical to that of a\nfreely falling body. Consider a tank containing\na liquid of density ρ with a small hole in its side\nat a height y\n\n1\n from the bottom (see Fig. 10.10).\n\nThe air above the liquid, whose surface is at\nheight y\n\n2\n, is at pressure P.

The speed of efflux, v\n1\n,\n\nfrom the side of the container is given by\n\nthe application of Bernoulli’s equation.\n\nIf the container is open at the top to the\n\natmosphere then 1   2  hv g= .\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n260 PHYSICS\n\nIf the cross-sectional area of the tank A\n2\n is\n\nmuch larger than that of the hole (A\n2\n >>A\n\n1\n), then\n\nwe may take the fluid to be approximately at rest\nat the top, i.e., v\n\n2\n = 0. Now, applying the Bernoulli\n\nequation at points 1 and 2 and noting that at\nthe hole P\n\n1\n = P\n\na\n, the atmospheric pressure, we\n\nhave from Eq.

On the other hand, if the tank is\nopen to the atmosphere, then P  = P\n\na \nand\n\nhgv    21 = (10.15)\n\nThis is also the speed of a freely falling body.\nEquation (10.15) represents Torricelli’s law.\n\n10.4.2 Venturi-meter\n\nThe Venturi-meter is a device to measure the\nflow speed of incompressible fluid. It consists of\na tube with a broad diameter and a small\nconstriction at the middle as shown in\nFig. (10.11). A manometer in the form of a\nU-tube is also attached to it, with one arm at\nthe broad neck point of the tube and the other\nat constriction as shown in Fig. (10.11).

The artery may get constricted\n\ndue to the accumulation of plaque on its inner\n\nwalls. In order to drive the blood through this\n\nconstriction a greater demand is placed on the\n\nactivity of the heart. The speed of the flow of\n\nthe blood in this region is raised which lowers\n\nthe pressure inside and the artery may\n\ncollapse due to the external pressure. The\n\nheart exerts further pressure to open this\n\nartery and forces the blood through. As the\n\nblood rushes through the opening, the\n\ninternal pressure once again drops due to\n\nsame reasons leading to a repeat collapse.\n\nThis may result in heart attack.\n\n10.4.4 Dynamic Lift\n\nDynamic lift is the force that acts on a body,\n\nsuch as airplane wing, a hydrofoil or a spinning\n\nball, by virtue of its motion through a fluid. In\n\nmany games such as cricket, tennis, baseball,\n\nor golf, we notice that a spinning ball deviates\n\nfrom its parabolic trajectory as it moves through\n\nair. This deviation can be partly explained on\n\nthe basis of Bernoulli’s principle.\n\n(i) Ball moving without spin: Fig. 10.13(a)\n\nshows the streamlines around a\n\nnon-spinning ball moving relative to a fluid.\n\nFrom the symmetry of streamlines it is clear\n\nthat the velocity of fluid (air) above and below\n\nthe ball at corresponding points is the same\n\nresulting in zero pressure difference. The air\n\ntherefore, exerts no upward or downward\n\nforce on the ball.\n\n(ii) Ball moving with spin: A ball which is\n\nspinning drags air along with it. If the\n\nsurface is rough more air will be dragged.\n\nFig 10.13(b) shows  the streamlines of air\n\nfor a ball which is moving and spinning at\n\nthe same time. The ball is moving forward\n\nand relative to it the air is moving\n\nbackwards. Therefore, the velocity of air\n\nabove the ball relative to the ball is larger\n\nand below it is smaller (see Section 10.3).\n\nThe stream lines, thus, get crowded above\n\nand rarified below.\n\nThis difference in the velocities of air results\n\nin the pressure difference between the lower and\n\nupper faces and there is a net upward force on\n\nthe ball. This dynamic lift due to spining is called\n\nMagnus effect.\n\n(a) (b) (c)\n\nFig 10.13 (a) Fluid streaming past a static sphere. (b) Streamlines for a fluid around a sphere spinning  clockwise.\n(c) Air flowing past an aerofoil.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n262 PHYSICS\n\nt\n\nAerofoil or lift on aircraft wing: Figure 10.13\n\n(c) shows an aerofoil, which is a solid piece\n\nshaped to provide an upward dynamic lift when\n\nit moves horizontally through air. The cross-\n\nsection of the wings of an aeroplane looks\n\nsomewhat like the aerofoil shown in Fig. 10.13 (c)\n\nwith streamlines around it. When the aerofoil\n\nmoves against the wind, the orientation of the\n\nwing relative to flow direction causes the\n\nstreamlines to crowd together above the wing\n\nmore than those below it. The flow speed on top\n\nis higher than that below it. There is an upward\n\nforce resulting in a dynamic lift of the wings and\n\nthis balances the weight of the plane. The\n\nfollowing example illustrates this.\n\nExample 10.8 A fully loaded Boeing\n\naircraft has a mass of 3.3 ×  105 kg. Its total\nwing area is 500 m2. It is in level flight with\n\na speed of 960 km/h. (a) Estimate the\n\npressure difference between the lower and\n\nupper surfaces of the wings (b) Estimate\n\nthe fractional increase in the speed of the\n\nair on the upper surface of the wing relative\n\nto the lower surface. [The density of air is ρ\n= 1.2 kg m-3]\n\nAnswer (a) The weight of the Boeing aircraft is\n\nbalanced by the upward force due to the\n\npressure difference\n\n∆P × A = 3.3 ×  105 kg ×  9.8\n\nP∆ = (3.3 ×  105 kg ×  9.8 m s–2) / 500 m2\n\n      = 6.5 × 103 Nm-2\n\n(b) We ignore the small height difference\n\nbetween the top and bottom sides in Eq. (10.12).\n\nThe pressure difference between them is\n\nthen\n\n∆P v v= ( )ρ\n2\n\n2\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n–\n\nwhere v\n2\n is the speed of air over the upper\n\nsurface and v\n1\n is the speed under the bottom\n\nsurface.\n\nv v\nP\n\nv v\n2 1\n\n2 1\n\n2\n–( ) =\n\n+( )\n∆\n\nρ\n\nTaking the average speed\n\nv\nav\n = (v\n\n2 \n+ v\n\n1\n)/2 = 960 km/h = 267 m s-1,\n\nwe have\n\nv v v\nP\n\nv\n2 1 2\n\n– /( ) =av\nav\n\n∆\nρ ≈  0.08\n\nThe speed above the wing needs to be only 8\n% higher than that below. t\n\n10.5  VISCOSITY\n\nMost of the fluids are not ideal ones and offer some\n\nresistance to motion. This resistance to fluid motion\n\nis like an internal friction analogous to friction when\n\na solid moves on a surface. It is called  viscosity.\n\nThis force exists when there is relative motion\n\nbetween layers of the liquid. Suppose we consider\n\na fluid  like oil  enclosed between two glass plates\n\nas shown in Fig. 10.14 (a). The bottom plate is fixed\n\nwhile the top plate is moved with a constant\n\nvelocity v relative to the fixed plate. If oil is\n\nreplaced by honey, a greater force is required to\n\nmove the plate with the same velocity. Hence\n\nwe say that honey is more viscous than oil. The\n\nfluid in contact with a surface has the same\n\nvelocity as that of the surfaces. Hence, the layer\n\nof the liquid in contact with top surface moves\n\nwith a velocity v and the layer of the liquid in\n\ncontact with the fixed surface is stationary. The\n\nvelocities of layers increase uniformly from\n\nbottom (zero velocity) to the top layer (velocity\n\nv). For any layer of liquid, its upper layer pulls\n\nit forward while lower layer pulls it backward.\n\nThis results in force between the layers. This\n\ntype of flow is known as laminar. The layers of\n\nliquid slide over one another as the pages of a\n\nbook do when it is placed flat on a table and a\n\nhorizontal force is applied to the top cover. When\n\na fluid is flowing in a pipe or a tube, then  velocity\n\nof the liquid layer along the axis of the tube is\n\nmaximum and  decreases  gradually as we move\n\ntowards the walls where it becomes zero, Fig.\n\n10.14 (b). The velocity on a cylindrical surface\n\nin a tube is constant.\n\nOn account of this motion, a portion of liquid,\n\nwhich at some instant has the shape ABCD, take\n\nthe shape of AEFD after short interval of time\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS 263\n\nt\n\n(∆t). During this time interval the liquid has\nundergone a shear strain of\n\n∆x/l. Since, the strain in a flowing fluid\nincreases with time continuously. Unlike a solid,\n\nhere the stress is found experimentally to depend\n\non ‘rate of change of strain’ or ‘strain rate’ i.e.\n\n∆x/(l ∆t) or v/l instead of strain itself. The\ncoefficient of viscosity (pronounced ‘eta’) for a\n\nfluid is defined as the ratio of shearing stress to\n\nthe strain rate.\n\nη = =\nF A\n\nv l\n\nF l\n\nv A\n\n/\n\n/\n(10.18)\n\nThe SI unit of viscosity is poiseiulle (Pl). Its\n\nother units are N s m-2 or Pa s. The dimensions\n\nof viscosity are [ML-1T-1]. Generally, thin liquids,\n\nlike water, alcohol, etc., are less viscous than\n\nthick liquids, like coal tar, blood, glycerine, etc.\n\nThe coefficients of viscosity for some common\n\nfluids are listed in Table 10.2. We point out two\n\nfacts about blood and water that you may find\n\ninteresting. As Table 10.2 indicates, blood is\n\n‘thicker’ (more viscous) than water. Further, the\n\nrelative viscosity (η/η\nwater\n\n) of blood remains\n\nconstant between 0 \no\nC and 37 \n\no\nC.\n\nThe viscosity of liquids decreases with\n\ntemperature, while it increases in the case of gases.\n\nExample 10.9 A metal block of area 0.10 m2\n\nis connected to a 0.010 kg mass via a string\n\nthat passes over an ideal pulley (considered\n\nmassless and frictionless), as in Fig. 10.15.\n\nA liquid with a film thickness of 0.30 mm\n\nis placed between the block and the table.\n\nWhen released the block moves to the right\n\nwith a constant speed of 0.085 m s-1. Find\n\nthe coefficient of viscosity of the liquid.\n\nAnswer The metal block moves to the right\n\nbecause of the tension in the string. The tension\n\nT is equal in magnitude to the weight of the\n\nsuspended mass m. Thus, the shear force  F  is\n\nF = T = mg = 0.010 kg ×  9.8 m s–2 = 9.8 ×  10-2 N\n\nShear stress on the fluid = F/A = N/m2\n\nStrain rate = \n\nη =\nstress\n\nstrain rate\ns\n\n-1\n\n  = \n\n  = 3.46 × 10-3 Pa s\n  t\n\n(a)\n\nFig. 10.15 Measurement of the coefficient of viscosity\nof a liquid.\n\n(b)\n\nFig 10.14 (a) A layer of liquid sandwiched between\ntwo parallel glass plates, in which the\n\nlower plate is fixed and the upper one is\n\nmoving to the right with velocity v\n(b) velocity distribution for viscous flow in\n\na pipe.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n264 PHYSICS\n\nt\n\nwhere ρ and σ are mass densities of sphere and\nthe fluid, respectively. We obtain\n\nv\nt\n = 2a2 (ρ-σ)g / (9η) (10.20)\n\nSo the terminal velocity v\nt\n depends on the\n\nsquare of the radius of the sphere and inversely\n\non the viscosity of the medium.\n\nYou may like to refer back to Example 6.2 in\n\nthis context.\n\nExample 10.10 The terminal velocity of a\n\ncopper ball of radius 2.0 mm falling through\n\na tank of oil at 20oC is 6.5 cm s-1. Compute\n\nthe viscosity of the oil at 20oC. Density of\n\noil is 1.5 ×103 kg m-3, density of copper is\n8.9 × 103 kg m-3.\n\nAnswer We have v\nt \n= 6.5 × 10-2 ms-1, a = 2 × 10-3 m,\n\ng = 9.8 ms-2,  ρ = 8.9 × 103 kg m-3,\n\nσ =1.5 ×103 kg m-3. From Eq. (10.20)\n\n   =  9.9 × 10-1 kg m–1 s–1 t\n\n10.6  SURFACE TENSION\n\nYou must have noticed that, oil and water do\n\nnot mix; water wets you and me but not ducks;\n\nmercury does not wet glass but water sticks to\n\nit, oil rises up a cotton wick, inspite of gravity,\n\nSap and water rise up to the top of the leaves of\n\nthe tree,  hair of a paint brush do not cling\n\ntogether when dry and even when dipped in\n\nwater but form a fine tip when taken out of it.\n\nAll these and many more such experiences are\n\nrelated with the free surfaces of liquids. As\n\nliquids have no definite shape but have a\n\ndefinite volume, they acquire a free surface when\n\npoured in a container. These surfaces  possess\n\nsome additional  energy. This phenomenon is\n\nknown as surface tension and it is concerned\n\nwith only liquid as gases do not have free\n\nsurfaces.  Let us now understand this\n\nphenomena.\n\nTable10.2 The viscosities of some fluids\n\nFluid T(oC) Viscosity (mPl)\n\nWater 20 1.0\n\n100 0.3\n\nBlood 37 2.7\n\nMachine Oil 16 113\n\n38 34\n\nGlycerine 20 830\n\nHoney – 200\n\nAir 0 0.017\n\n40 0.019\n\n10.5.1 Stokes’ Law\n\nWhen a body falls through a fluid it drags the\n\nlayer of the fluid in contact with it. A relative\n\nmotion between the different layers of the fluid\n\nis set and, as a result, the body experiences a\n\nretarding force. Falling of a raindrop and\n\nswinging of a pendulum bob are some common\n\nexamples of such motion. It is seen that the\n\nviscous force is proportional to the velocity of\n\nthe object and is opposite to the direction of\n\nmotion. The other quantities on which the force\n\nF depends are viscosity η of the fluid and radius\na of the sphere. Sir George G. Stokes (1819–\n\n1903), an English scientist enunciated clearly\n\nthe viscous drag force F as\n\n6F avη= π (10.19)\n\nThis is known as Stokes’ law. We shall not\n\nderive Stokes’ law.\n\nThis law is an interesting example of retarding\n\nforce, which is proportional to velocity. We can\n\nstudy its consequences on an object falling\n\nthrough a viscous  medium. We consider a\n\nraindrop in air. It accelerates initially due to\n\ngravity. As the velocity increases, the retarding\n\nforce also increases. Finally, when viscous force\n\nplus buoyant force becomes equal to the force\n\ndue to gravity, the net force becomes zero and so\n\ndoes the acceleration. The sphere (raindrop) then\n\ndescends with a constant velocity. Thus, in\n\nequilibrium, this terminal velocity v\nt \nis given by\n\n6πηav\nt\n = (4π/3) a3 (ρ-σ)g\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS 265\n\nFig. 10.16 Schematic picture of molecules in a liquid, at the surface and balance of forces.

(c) Balance of attractive (AI and repulsive (R) forces.\n\nterms of this fact. What is the energy required\n\nfor having a molecule at the surface? As\n\nmentioned above, roughly it is half the energy\n\nrequired to remove it entirely from the liquid\n\ni.e., half the heat of evaporation.\n\nFinally, what is a surface? Since a liquid\n\nconsists of molecules moving about, there cannot\n\nbe a perfectly sharp surface. The density of the\n\nliquid molecules drops rapidly to zero around\n\nz = 0 as we move along the direction indicated\n\nFig 10.16 (c) in a distance of the order of a few\n\nmolecular sizes.\n\nand to disperse them far away from each other\n\nin order to evaporate or vaporise, the heat of\n\nevaporation required is quite large. For water it\n\nis of the order of 40 kJ/mol.\n\nLet us consider a molecule near the surface\n\nFig. 10.16(b). Only lower half side of it is\n\nsurrounded by liquid molecules. There is some\n\nnegative potential energy due to these, but\n\nobviously it is less than that of a molecule in\n\nbulk, i.e., the one fully inside. Approximately\n\nit is half of the latter. Thus, molecules on a\n\nliquid surface have some extra energy in\n\ncomparison to molecules in the interior.  A\n\nliquid, thus, tends to have the least surface\n\narea which external conditions permit.\n\nIncreasing surface area requires energy. Most\n\nsurface phenomenon can be understood in\n\n10.6.2 Surface Energy and Surface Tension\n\nAs we have discussed that an extra energy is\n\nassociated with surface of liquids, the creation\n\nof more surface (spreading of surface) keeping\n\nother things like volume fixed requires\n\nadditional energy. To appreciate this, consider\n\na horizontal liquid film ending in bar free to slide\n\nover parallel guides Fig (10.17).\n\n10.6.1 Surface Energy\n\nA liquid stays together because of attraction\n\nbetween molecules. Consider a molecule well\n\ninside a liquid. The intermolecular distances are\n\nsuch that it is attracted to all the surrounding\n\nmolecules [Fig. 10.16(a)]. This attraction results\n\nin a negative potential energy for the molecule,\n\nwhich depends on the number and distribution\n\nof molecules around the chosen one. But the\n\naverage potential energy of all the molecules is\n\nthe same. This is supported by the fact that to\n\ntake a collection of such molecules (the liquid)\n\nFig. 10.17 Stretching a film. (a) A film in equilibrium;\n\n(b) The film stretched an extra distance.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n266 PHYSICS\n\nSuppose that we move the bar by a small\n\ndistance d as shown. Since the area of the\n\nsurface increases, the system now has more\n\nenergy, this means that some work has been\n\ndone against an internal force. Let this internal\n\nforce be F, the work done by the applied force is\n\nF.d = Fd. From conservation of energy, this is\n\nstored as additional energy in the film. If the\n\nsurface energy of the film is S per unit area, the\n\nextra area is 2dl. A film has two sides and the\n\nliquid in between, so there are two surfaces and\n\nthe extra energy is\n\nS (2dl) = Fd (10.21)\n\nOr, S=Fd/2dl = F/2l (10.22)\n\nThis quantity S is the magnitude of surface\n\ntension. It is equal to the surface energy per unit\n\narea of the liquid interface and is also equal to\n\nthe force per unit length exerted by the fluid on\n\nthe movable bar.\n\nSo far we have talked about the surface of one\n\nliquid. More generally, we need to consider fluid\n\nsurface in contact with other fluids or solid\n\nsurfaces. The surface energy in that case depends\n\non the materials on both sides of the surface. For\n\nexample, if the molecules of the materials attract\n\neach other, surface energy is reduced while if they\n\nrepel each other the surface energy is increased.\n\nThus, more appropriately, the surface energy is\n\nthe energy of the interface between two materials\n\nand depends on both of them.\n\nWe make the following observations from\n\nabove:\n\n(i) Surface tension is a force per unit length\n\n(or surface energy per unit area) acting in\n\nthe plane of the interface between the plane\n\nof the liquid and any other substance; it also\n\nis the extra energy that the molecules at the\n\ninterface have as compared to molecules in\n\nthe interior.\n\n(ii) At any point on the interface besides the\n\nboundary, we can draw a line and imagine\n\nequal and opposite surface tension forces S\n\nper unit length of the line acting\n\nperpendicular to the line, in the plane of the\n\ninterface. The line is in equilibrium. To be\n\nmore specific, imagine a line of atoms or\n\nmolecules at the surface. The atoms to the\n\nleft pull the line towards them; those to the\n\nright pull it towards them! This line of atoms\n\nis in equilibrium under tension. If the line\n\nreally marks the end of the interface, as in\n\nFigure 10.16 (a) and (b) there is only the force\n\nS per unit length acting inwards.\n\nTable 10.3 gives the surface tension of various\n\nliquids. The value of surface tension depends\n\non temperature. Like viscosity, the surface\n\ntension of a liquid usually falls with\n\ntemperature.\n\nTable 10.3 Surface tension of some liquids at the\ntemperatures indicated with the\nheats of the vaporisation\n\nLiquid Temp (oC) Surface Heat of\n\nTension vaporisation\n (N/m)  (kJ/mol)\n\nHelium –270 0.000239 0.115\n\nOxygen –183 0.0132 7.1\n\nEthanol 20 0.0227 40.6\n\nWater 20 0.0727 44.16\n\nMercury 20 0.4355 63.2\n\nA fluid will stick to a solid surface if the\n\nsurface energy between fluid and the solid is\n\nsmaller than the sum of surface energies\n\nbetween solid-air, and fluid-air. Now there is\n\nattraction between the solid surface and the\n\nliquid. It can be directly measured\n\nexperimentaly as schematically shown in Fig.\n\n10.18. A flat vertical glass plate, below which a\n\nvessel of some liquid is kept, forms one arm of\n\nthe balance. The plate is balanced by weights\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS 267\n\non the other side, with its horizontal edge just\n\nover water. The vessel is raised slightly till the\n\nliquid just touches the glass plate and pulls it\n\ndown a little because of surface tension. Weights\n\nare added till the plate just clears water.\n\nFig. 10.18 Measuring Surface Tension.\n\nSuppose the additional weight required is W.\n\nThen from Eq. 10.22 and the discussion given\n\nthere, the surface tension of the liquid-air\n\ninterface is\n\nS\nla \n\n= (W/2l) = (mg/2l ) (10.23)\n\nwhere m is the extra mass and l is the length of\n\nthe plate edge. The subscript (la) emphasises\n\nthe fact that the liquid-air interface tension is\n\ninvolved.\n\n10.6.3 Angle of Contact\n\nThe surface of liquid near the plane of contact,\n\nwith another medium is in general curved. The\n\nangle between tangent to the liquid surface at\n\nthe point of contact and solid surface inside the\n\nliquid is termed as angle of contact. It is denoted\n\nby θ. It is different at interfaces of different pairs\nof liquids and solids. The value of θ determines\nwhether a liquid will spread on the surface of a\n\nsolid or it will form droplets on it. For example,\n\nwater forms droplets on lotus leaf as shown in\n\nFig. 10.19 (a) while spreads over a clean plastic\n\nplate as shown in Fig. 10.19(b).\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFig. 10.19 Different shapes of water drops with\ninterfacial tensions (a) on a lotus leaf (b)\n\non a clean plastic plate.\n\nWe consider the three interfacial tensions at\n\nall the three interfaces, liquid-air, solid-air and\n\nsolid-liquid denoted by S\nla\n, S\n\nsa\n and S\n\nsl \n, respectively\n\nas given in Fig. 10.19 (a) and (b). At the line of\n\ncontact, the surface forces between the three media\n\nmust be in equilibrium. From the Fig. 10.19(b) the\n\nfollowing relation is easily derived.\n\nS\nla\n cos θ  +  S\n\nsl\n =  S\n\nsa\n(10.24)\n\nThe angle of contact is an obtuse angle if\n\nS\nsl  \n\n> S\nla\n as in the case of water-leaf interface\n\nwhile it is an acute angle if S\nsl  \n\n< S\nla\n as in the\n\ncase of water-plastic interface. When θ is an\nobtuse angle then molecules of liquids are\n\nattracted strongly to themselves and weakly to\n\nthose of solid, it costs a lot of energy to create a\n\nliquid-solid surface, and liquid then does not\n\nwet the solid. This is what happens with water\n\non a waxy or oily surface, and with mercury on\n\nany surface. On the other hand, if the molecules\n\nof the liquid are strongly attracted to those of\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n268 PHYSICS\n\nthe solid, this will reduce S\nsl\n and therefore,\n\ncos θ may increase or θ may decrease. In this\ncase θ is an acute angle. This is what happens\nfor water on glass or on plastic and for kerosene\n\noil on virtually anything (it just spreads). Soaps,\n\ndetergents and dying substances are wetting\n\nagents. When they are added the angle of\n\ncontact becomes small so that these may\n\npenetrate well and become effective. Water\n\nproofing agents on the other hand are added to\n\ncreate a large angle of contact between the water\n\nand fibres.\n\n10.6.4 Drops and Bubbles\n\nOne consequence of surface tension is that free\n\nliquid drops and bubbles are spherical if effects\n\nof gravity can be neglected. You must have seen\n\nthis especially clearly in small drops just formed\n\nin a high-speed spray or jet, and in soap bubbles\n\nblown by most of us in childhood. Why are drops\n\nand bubbles spherical? What keeps soap\n\nbubbles stable?\n\nAs we have been saying repeatedly, a liquid-\n\nair interface has energy, so for a given volume\n\nthe surface with minimum energy is the one with\n\nthe least area. The sphere has this property.\n\nThough it is out of the scope of this book, but\n\nyou can check that a sphere is better than at\n\nleast a cube in this respect! So, if gravity and\n\nother forces (e.g. air resistance) were ineffective,\n\nliquid drops would be spherical.\n\nAnother interesting consequence of surface\n\ntension is that the pressure inside a spherical\n\ndrop Fig. 10.20(a) is more than the pressure\n\noutside. Suppose a spherical drop of radius r is\n\nin equilibrium. If its radius increase by ∆r. The\nextra surface energy is\n\n[4π(r + ∆r) 2- 4πr2] S\nla\n = 8πr ∆r S\n\nla\n(10.25)\n\nIf the drop is in equilibrium this energy cost is\n\nbalanced by the energy gain due to\n\nexpansion under the pressure difference (P\ni\n – P\n\no\n)\n\nbetween the inside of the bubble and the outside.\n\nThe work done is\n\nW = (P\ni\n – P\n\no\n) 4πr2∆r (10.26)\n\nso that\n\n(P\ni\n – P\n\no\n) = (2 S\n\nla\n/ r) (10.27)\n\nIn general, for a liquid-gas interface, the\n\nconvex side has a higher pressure than the\n\nconcave side. For example, an air bubble in a\n\nliquid, would have higher pressure inside it.\n\nSee Fig 10.20 (b).\n\nFig. 10.20 Drop, cavity and bubble of radius r.\n\nA bubble Fig 10.20 (c) differs from a drop\n\nand a cavity; in this it has two interfaces.\n\nApplying the above argument we have for a\n\nbubble\n\n (P\ni\n – P\n\no\n) = (4 S\n\nla\n/ r) (10.28)\n\nThis is probably why you have to blow hard,\n\nbut not too hard, to form a soap bubble. A little\n\nextra air pressure is needed inside!\n\n10.6.5 Capillary Rise\n\nOne consequence of the pressure difference\n\nacross a curved liquid-air interface is the well-\n\nknown effect that water rises up in a narrow\n\ntube in spite of gravity. The word capilla means\n\nhair in Latin; if the tube were hair thin, the rise\n\nwould be very large. To see this, consider a\n\nvertical capillary tube of circular cross section\n\n(radius a) inserted into an open vessel of water\n\n(Fig. 10.21). The contact angle between water\n\nFig. 10.21 Capillary rise, (a) Schematic picture of a\nnarrow tube immersed water.\n\n(b) Enlarged picture near interface.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS 269\n\nand glass is acute. Thus the surface of water in\n\nthe capillary is concave. This means that\n\nthere is a pressure difference between the\n\ntwo sides of the top surface. This is given by\n\n(P\ni\n – P\n\no\n) =(2S/r) = 2S/(a sec θ )\n\n= (2S/a) cos θ (10.29)\n\nThus the pressure of the water inside the\n\ntube, just at the meniscus (air-water interface)\n\nis less than the atmospheric pressure. Consider\n\nthe two points A and B in Fig. 10.21(a). They\n\nmust be at the same pressure, namely\n\nP\n0\n + h ρ  g = P\n\ni\n = P\n\nA\n(10.30)\n\nwhere ρρρρρ is the density of water and h is called\nthe capillary rise [Fig. 10.21(a)]. Using\n\nEq. (10.29) and (10.30) we have\n\nh ρ  g = (P\ni\n – P\n\n0\n) = (2S cos θ  )/a    (10.31)\n\nThe discussion here, and the Eqs. (10.26) and\n\n(10.27) make it clear that the capillary rise is\n\ndue to surface tension. It is larger, for a smaller\n\na. Typically it is of the order of a few cm for fine\n\ncapillaries. For example, if a = 0.05 cm, using\n\nthe value of surface tension for water (Table\n\n10.3), we find that\n\nh = 2S/(ρ  g a)\n\n  \n\n-1\n\n3 -3 -2 -4\n\n2×(0.073 N m )\n=\n\n(10 kg m ) (9.8 m s )(5 × 10 m)\n\n  = 2.98 ×  10–2 m = 2.98 cm\n\nNotice that if the liquid meniscus is convex,\n\nas for mercury, i.e., if cos θ is negative then from\nEq. (10.30) for example, it is clear that the liquid\n\nwill be lower in the capillary !\n\n10.6.6 Detergents and Surface Tension\n\nWe clean dirty clothes containing grease and oil\n\nstains sticking to cotton or other fabrics by\n\nadding detergents or soap to water, soaking\n\nclothes in it and shaking. Let us understand\n\nthis process better.\n\nWashing with water does not remove grease\n\nstains. This is because water does not wet greasy\n\ndirt; i.e., there is very little area of contact\n\nbetween them. If water could wet grease, the flow\n\nof water could carry some grease away.\n\nSomething of this sort is achieved through\n\ndetergents. The molecules of detergents are\n\nhairpin shaped, with one end attracted to water\nand the other to molecules of grease, oil or wax,\nthus tending to form water-oil interfaces. The result\nis shown in Fig. 10.22 as a sequence of figures.\n\nIn our language, we would say that addition\nof detergents, whose molecules attract at one\nend and say, oil on the other, reduces drastically\nthe surface tension S (water-oil). It may even\nbecome energetically favourable to form such\ninterfaces, i.e., globs of dirt surrounded by\ndetergents and then by water. This kind of\nprocess using surface active detergents or\nsurfactants is important not only for cleaning,\nbut also in recovering oil, mineral ores etc.\n\nFig. 10.22 Detergent action in terms of what\ndetergent molecules do.\n\n.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n270 PHYSICS\n\nt\n\nExample 10.11 The lower end of a capillary\ntube of diameter 2.00 mm is dipped 8.00\ncm below the surface of water in a beaker.\nWhat is the pressure required in the tube\nin order to blow a hemispherical bubble at\nits end in water? The surface tension of\nwater at temperature of the experiments is\n7.30×10-2 Nm-1. 1 atmospheric pressure =\n1.01 × 105 Pa, density of water = 1000 kg/m3,\ng = 9.80 m s-2. Also calculate the excess\npressure.\n\nAnswer The excess pressure in a bubble of gas\nin a liquid is given by 2S/r, where S is the\nsurface tension of the liquid-gas interface. You\nshould note there is only one liquid surface in\nthis case. (For a bubble of liquid in a gas, there\nare two liquid surfaces, so the formula for\n\nexcess pressure in that case is 4S/r.) The\nradius of the bubble is r. Now the pressure\noutside the bubble P\n\no\n equals atmospheric\n\npressure plus the pressure due to 8.00 cm of\nwater column. That is\n\nP\no\n = (1.01 × 105 Pa + 0.08 m × 1000 kg m–3\n\n    × 9.80 m s–2)\n    = 1.01784 × 105 Pa\n\nTherefore, the pressure inside the bubble is\n  P\n\ni \n = P\n\no\n + 2S/r\n\n= 1.01784 × 105 Pa + (2 × 7.3 × 10-2 Pa m/10-3 m)\n= (1.01784 + 0.00146) × 105  Pa\n= 1.02  × 105 Pa\n\nwhere the radius of the bubble is taken\nto be equal to the radius of the capillary tube,\nsince the bubble is hemispherical ! (The answer\nhas been rounded off to three significant\nfigures.) The excess pressure in the\nbubble is 146 Pa. t\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. The basic property of a fluid is that it can flow. The fluid does not have any\n\nresistance to change of its shape. Thus, the shape of a fluid is governed by the\n\nshape of its container.\n\n2. A liquid is incompressible and has a free surface of its own. A gas is compressible\n\nand it expands to occupy all the space available to it.\n\n3. If F is the normal force exerted by a fluid on an area A then the average pressure P\nav\n\nis defined as the ratio of the force to area\n\nA\n\nF\nP\n\nav\n=\n\n4. The unit of the pressure is the pascal (Pa). It is the same as N m-2. Other common\n\nunits of pressure are\n\n1 atm = 1.01×105 Pa\n\n1 bar = 105 Pa\n\n1 torr = 133 Pa = 0.133 kPa\n\n1 mm of Hg = 1 torr = 133 Pa\n\n5. Pascal’s law states that: Pressure in a fluid at rest is same at all points which are at\n\nthe same height. A change in pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted\n\nundiminished to every point of the fluid and the walls of the containing vessel.\n\n6. The pressure in a fluid varies with depth h according to the expression\n\nP = P\na \n+ ρgh\n\nwhere  ρ is the density of the fluid, assumed uniform.\n\n7. The volume of an incompressible fluid passing any point every second in a pipe of\n\nnon uniform crossection is the same in the steady flow.\n\nv A = constant ( v is the velocity and A is the area of crossection)\n\nThe equation is due to mass conservation in incompressible fluid flow.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS 271\n\n8. Bernoulli’s principle states that as we move along a streamline, the sum of the\n\npressure (P), the kinetic energy per unit volume (ρv2/2) and the potential energy per\nunit volume (ρgy) remains a constant.\nP + ρv2/2 + ρgy = constant\n\nThe equation is basically the conservation of energy applied to non viscuss fluid\n\nmotion in steady state. There is no fluid which have zero viscosity, so the above\n\nstatement is true only approximately. The viscosity is like friction and converts the\n\nkinetic energy to heat energy.\n\n9. Though shear strain in a fluid does not require shear stress, when a shear stress is\n\napplied to a fluid, the motion is generated which causes a shear strain growing\n\nwith time. The ratio of the shear stress to the time rate of shearing strain is known\n\nas coefficient of viscosity, η.\n\nwhere symbols have their usual meaning and are defined in the text.\n\n10. Stokes’ law states that the viscous drag force F on a sphere of radius a moving with\n\nvelocity v through a fluid of viscosity is, F = 6πηav.\n\n11. Surface tension is a force per unit length (or surface energy per unit area) acting in\n\nthe plane of interface between the liquid and the bounding surface. It is the extra\n\nenergy that the molecules at the interface have as compared to the interior.\n\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n\n1. Pressure is a scalar quantity. The definition of the pressure as “force per unit area”\nmay give one false impression that pressure is a vector. The “force” in the numerator of\nthe definition is the component of the force normal to the area upon which it is\nimpressed. While describing fluids as a concept, shift from particle and rigid body\nmechanics is required. We are concerned with properties that vary from point to point\nin the fluid.\n\n2.  One should not think of pressure of a fluid as being exerted only on a solid like the\nwalls of a container or a piece of solid matter immersed in the fluid. Pressure exists at\nall points in a fluid. An element of a fluid (such as the one shown in Fig. 10.2) is in\nequilibrium because the pressures exerted on the various faces are equal.\n\n3. The expression for pressure\nP = P\n\na \n+ ρgh\n\nholds true if fluid is incompressible. Practically speaking it holds for liquids, which\nare largely incompressible and hence  is a constant with height.\n\n4. The gauge pressure is the difference of the actual pressure and the atmospheric pressure.\nP – P\n\na \n= P\n\ng\n\nMany pressure-measuring devices measure the gauge pressure. These include the tyre\npressure gauge and the blood pressure gauge (sphygmomanometer).\n\n5. A streamline is a map of fluid flow. In a steady flow two streamlines do not intersect as\nit means that the fluid particle will have two possible velocities at the point.\n\n6. Bernoulli’s principle does not hold in presence of viscous drag on the fluid. The work\ndone by this dissipative viscous force must be taken into account in this case, and P\n\n2\n\n[Fig. 10.9] will be lower than the value given by Eq. (10.12).\n7. As the temperature rises the atoms of the liquid become more mobile and the coefficient\n\nof viscosity, η  falls. In a gas the temperature rise increases the random motion of\natoms and η  increases.\n\n8. Surface tension arises due to excess potential energy of the molecules on the surface\nin comparison to their potential energy in the interior. Such a surface energy is present\nat the interface separating two substances at least one of which is a fluid. It is not the\nproperty of a single fluid alone.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n272 PHYSICS\n\nEXERCISES\n\n10.1 Explain why\n(a) The blood pressure in humans is greater at the feet than at the brain\n(b) Atmospheric pressure at a height of about 6 km decreases to nearly half of\n\nits value at the sea level, though the height of the atmosphere is more than\n100 km\n\n(c) Hydrostatic pressure is a scalar quantity even though pressure is force\ndivided by area.\n\n10.2 Explain why\n(a) The angle of contact of mercury with glass is obtuse, while that of water\n\nwith glass is acute.\n(b) Water on a clean glass surface tends to spread out while mercury on the\n\nsame surface tends to form drops.

This placed a number of demands on the circulatory system. The\nvenous system that returns blood from the lower extremities to the heart underwent changes. You\nwill recall that veins are blood vessels through which blood returns to the heart. Humans and\nanimals such as the giraffe have adapted to the problem of moving blood upward against gravity.\nBut animals such as snakes, rats and rabbits will die if held upwards, since the blood remains in\nthe lower extremities and the venous system is unable to move it towards the heart.\n\nFig. 10.26 Schematic view of the gauge pressures in the arteries in various parts of the human body while\nstanding or lying down. The pressures shown are averaged over a heart cycle.\n\nFigure 10.26 shows the average pressures observed in the arteries at various points in the human body.\nSince viscous effects are small, we can use Bernoulli’s equation, Eq.

The kinetic energy term (ρ  v2/2) can be ignored since the velocities in\nthe three arteries are small (≈  0.1 m s–1) and almost constant. Hence the gauge pressures at the brain P\n\nB\n,\n\nthe heart P\nH\n, and the foot P\n\nF \nare related by\n\nP\nF\n = P\n\nH\n +  ρ g h\n\nH\n = P\n\nB\n + ρ g h\n\nB\n(10.34)\n\nwhere ρ is the density of blood.\nTypical values of the heights to the heart and the brain are h\n\nH\n = 1.3 m and h\n\nB\n = 1.7 m. Taking\n\nρ = 1.06 ×  103 kg m–3 we obtain that P\nF  \n\n= 26.8 kPa (kilopascals) and\n \nP\n\nB\n = 9.3 kPa given that P\n\nH\n = 13.3 kPa.\n\nThus the pressures in the lower and upper parts of the body are so different when a person is standing,\nbut are almost equal when he is lying down. As mentioned in the text the units for pressure more\ncommonly employed in medicine and physiology are torr and mm of Hg. 1 mm of Hg = 1 torr = 0.133 kPa.\nThus the average pressure at the heart is P\n\nH\n = 13.3 kPa = 100 mm of Hg.\n\nThe human body is a marvel of nature. The veins in the lower extremities are equipped with valves,\nwhich open when blood flows towards the heart and close if it tends to drain down. Also, blood is returned\nat least partially by the pumping action associated with breathing and by the flexing of the skeletal muscles\nduring walking. This explains why a soldier who is required to stand at attention may faint because of\ninsufficient return of the blood to the heart. Once he is made to lie down, the pressures become equalized\nand he regains consciousness.\n\nAn instrument called the sphygmomanometer usually measures the blood pressure of humans. It is a\nfast, painless and non-invasive technique and gives the doctor a reliable idea about the patient’s health.\nThe measurement process is shown in Fig. 10.27. There are two reasons why the upper arm is used. First,\nit is at the same level as the heart and measurements here give values close to that at the heart. Secondly,\nthe upper arm contains a single bone and makes the artery there (called the brachial artery) easy to\ncompress. We have all measured pulse rates by placing our fingers over the wrist. Each pulse takes a little\nless than a second. During each pulse the pressure in the heart and the  circulatory  system goes through a\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS 277\n\nmaximum as the blood is pumped by the heart (systolic  pressure) and a minimum as the heart relaxes\n(diastolic pressure). The sphygmomanometer is a device, which measures these extreme pressures. It\nworks on the principle that blood flow in the brachial (upper arm) artery can be made to go from\nlaminar to turbulent by suitable compression. Turbulent flow is dissipative, and its sound can be\npicked up on the stethoscope.\n\nThe gauge pressure in an air sack wrapped around the upper arm is measured using a manometer or a\n\ndial pressure gauge (Fig. 10.27). The pressure in the sack is first increased till the brachial artery is closed.\n\nThe pressure in the sack is then slowly reduced while a stethoscope placed just below the sack is used to\nlisten to noises arising in the brachial artery. When\n\nthe pressure is just below the systolic (peak)\npressure, the artery opens briefly. During this brief\n\nperiod, the blood velocity in the highly constricted\n\nartery is high and turbulent and hence noisy. The\n\nresulting noise is heard as a tapping sound on the\nstethoscope. When the pressure in the sack is\n\nlowered further, the artery remains open for a longer\n\nportion of the heart cycle. Nevertheless, it remains\n\nclosed during the diastolic (minimum pressure)\nphase of the heartbeat. Thus the duration of the\n\ntapping sound is longer. When the pressure in the\nsack reaches the diastolic pressure the artery is\n\nopen during the entire heart cycle. The flow is\n\nhowever, still turbulent and noisy. But instead of a\n\ntapping sound we hear a steady, continuous roar\n\non the stethoscope.\n\nThe blood pressure of a patient is presented as the ratio of systolic/diastolic pressures. For a resting\n\nhealthy adult it is typically 120/80 mm of Hg (120/80 torr). Pressures above 140/90 require medical\n\nattention and advice. High blood pressures may seriously damage the heart, kidney and other organs and\n\nmust be controlled.\n\nFig. 10.27 Blood pressure measurement using the\nsphygmomanometer and stethoscope.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nch-12.pmd\n\n\nCHAPTER TWELVE\n\nTHERMODYNAMICS\n\n12.1  INTRODUCTION\n\nIn previous chapter we have studied thermal properties of\nmatter. In this chapter we shall study laws that govern\nthermal energy. We shall study the processes where work is\nconverted into heat and vice versa. In winter, when we rub\nour palms together, we feel warmer; here work done in rubbing\nproduces the  ‘heat’.  Conversely, in a steam engine, the ‘heat’\nof the steam is used to do useful work in moving the pistons,\nwhich in turn rotate the wheels of the train.\n\nIn physics, we need to define the notions of heat,\ntemperature, work, etc. more carefully.  Historically, it took a\nlong time to arrive at the proper concept of ‘heat’. Before the\nmodern picture, heat was regarded as a fine invisible fluid\nfilling in the pores of a substance.  On contact between a hot\nbody and a cold body, the fluid  (called caloric) flowed from\nthe colder to the hotter body ! This is similar to what happens\nwhen a horizontal pipe connects two tanks containing water\nup to different heights. The flow continues until the levels of\nwater in the two tanks are the same.  Likewise, in the ‘caloric’\npicture of heat, heat flows until the ‘caloric levels’ (i.e., the\ntemperatures) equalise.\n\nIn time, the picture of heat as a fluid was discarded in\nfavour of the modern concept of heat as a form of energy. An\nimportant experiment in this connection was due to Benjamin\nThomson (also known as Count Rumford) in 1798. He\nobserved that boring of a brass cannon generated a lot of\nheat, indeed enough to boil water. More significantly, the\namount of heat produced depended on the work done (by the\nhorses employed for turning the drill) but not on the\nsharpness of the drill. In the caloric picture, a sharper drill\nwould scoop out more heat fluid from the pores; but this\nwas not observed. A most natural explanation of the\nobservations was that heat was a form of energy and the\nexperiment demonstrated conversion of energy from one form\nto another–from work to heat.\n\n12.1 Introduction\n\n12.2 Thermal equilibrium\n\n12.3 Zeroth law of\nThermodynamics\n\n12.4 Heat, internal energy and\nwork\n\n12.5 First law of\nthermodynamics\n\n12.6 Specific heat capacity\n\n12.7 Thermodynamic state\nvariables and equation of\nstate\n\n12.8 Thermodynamic processes\n\n12.9 Heat engines\n\n12.10 Refrigerators and heat\npumps\n\n12.11 Second law of\nthermodynamics\n\n12.12 Reversible and irreversible\nprocesses\n\n12.13 Carnot engine\n\nSummary\n\nPoints to ponder\n\nExercises\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS304\n\nThermodynamics is the branch of physics that\ndeals with the concepts of heat and temperature\nand the inter-conversion of heat and other forms\nof energy. Thermodynamics is a macroscopic\nscience. It deals with bulk systems and does not\ngo into the molecular constitution of matter. In\nfact, its concepts and laws were formulated in the\nnineteenth century before the molecular picture\nof matter was firmly established.  Thermodynamic\ndescription involves relatively few macroscopic\nvariables of the system, which are suggested by\ncommon sense and can be usually measured\ndirectly. A microscopic description of a gas, for\nexample, would involve specifying the co-ordinates\nand velocities of the huge number of molecules\nconstituting the gas. The description in kinetic\ntheory of gases is not so detailed but it does involve\nmolecular distribution of velocities.\nThermodynamic description of a gas, on the other\nhand, avoids the molecular description altogether.\nInstead, the state of a gas in thermodynamics is\nspecified by macroscopic variables such as\npressure, volume, temperature, mass and\ncomposition that  are felt by our sense perceptions\n\nand are measurable*.\nThe distinction between mechanics and\n\nthermodynamics is worth bearing in mind.  In\nmechanics, our interest is in the motion of particles\nor bodies under the action of forces and torques.\nThermodynamics is not concerned with the\nmotion of the system as a whole.  It is concerned\nwith the internal macroscopic state of the body.\nWhen a bullet is fired from a gun, what changes\nis the mechanical state of the bullet (its kinetic\nenergy, in particular), not its temperature.  When\nthe bullet pierces a wood and stops, the kinetic\nenergy of the bullet gets converted into heat,\nchanging the temperature of the bullet and the\nsurrounding layers of wood.  Temperature is\nrelated to the energy of the internal (disordered)\nmotion of the bullet, not to the motion of the bullet\nas a whole.\n\n12.2  THERMAL EQUILIBRIUM\n\nEquilibrium in mechanics means that the net\nexternal force and torque on a system are zero.\nThe term ‘equilibrium’ in thermodynamics appears\n\nin a different context : we say the state of a system\n\nis an equilibrium state if the macroscopic\n\nvariables that characterise the system do not\nchange in time. For example, a gas inside a closed\n\nrigid container, completely insulated from its\n\nsurroundings, with fixed values of pressure,\n\nvolume, temperature, mass and composition that\n\ndo not change with time, is in a state of\n\nthermodynamic equilibrium.\n\nFig. 12.1 (a) Systems A and B (two gases) separated\nby an adiabatic wall – an insulating wall\n\nthat does not allow flow of heat. (b) The\n\nsame systems A and B separated by a\n\ndiathermic wall – a conducting wall that\n\nallows heat to flow from one to another.  In\n\nthis case, thermal equilibrium is attained\n\nin due course.\n\nIn general, whether or not a system is in a state\nof equilibrium depends on the surroundings and\nthe nature of the wall that separates the system\nfrom the surroundings.  Consider two gases A and\nB occupying two different containers. We know\nexperimentally that pressure and volume of a\ngiven mass of gas can be chosen to be its two\nindependent variables. Let the pressure and\nvolume of the gases be (P\n\nA\n, V\n\nA\n) and (P\n\nB\n, V\n\nB\n)\n\nrespectively.  Suppose first that the two systems\nare put in proximity but are separated by an\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n* Thermodynamics may also involve other variables that are not so obvious to our senses  e.g. entropy, enthalpy,\netc., and they are all macroscopic variables. However, a thermodynamic state is specified by five state\n\nvariables viz., pressure, volume, temperature, internal energy and entropy. Entropy is a measure of disorderness\n\nin the system. Enthalpy is a measure of total heat content of the system.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTHERMODYNAMICS 305\n\nadiabatic wall – an insulating wall (can be\nmovable) that does not allow flow of energy (heat)\nfrom one to another. The systems are insulated\nfrom the rest of the surroundings also by similar\nadiabatic walls. The situation is shown\nschematically in Fig. 12.1 (a). In this case, it is\nfound that any possible pair of values (P\n\nA\n, V\n\nA\n) will\n\nbe in equilibrium with any possible pair of values\n(P\n\nB\n, V\n\nB\n).  Next, suppose that the adiabatic wall is\n\nreplaced by a diathermic wall – a conducting wall\nthat allows energy flow (heat) from one to another.\nIt is then found that the macroscopic variables of\nthe systems A and B change spontaneously until\nboth the systems attain equilibrium states. After\nthat there is no change in their states. The\nsituation is shown in Fig. 12.1(b).  The pressure\nand volume variables of the two gases change to\n(P\n\nB\n′, V\n\nB\n′) and (P\n\nA\n′, V\n\nA\n′) such that the new states\n\nof A and B are in equilibrium with each other*.\nThere is no more energy flow from one to another.\nWe then say that the system A is in thermal\nequilibrium with the system B.\n\nWhat characterises the situation of thermal\nequilibrium between two systems ? You can guess\n\nthe answer from your experience. In thermal\n\nequilibrium, the temperatures of the two systems\nare equal. We shall see how does one arrive at the\nconcept of temperature in thermodynamics? The\nZeroth law of thermodynamics provides the clue.\n\n12.3  ZEROTH LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS\n\nImagine two systems A and B, separated by an\n\nadiabatic wall, while each is in contact with a third\n\nsystem C, via a conducting wall [Fig. 12.2(a)]. The\n\nstates of the systems (i.e., their macroscopic\n\nvariables) will change until both A and B come to\n\nthermal equilibrium with C. After this is achieved,\n\nsuppose that the adiabatic wall between A and B\n\nis replaced by a conducting wall and C is insulated\n\nfrom A and B by an adiabatic wall [Fig.12.2(b)]. It\n\nis found that the states of A and B change no\n\nfurther i.e. they are found to be in thermal\n\nequilibrium with each other. This observation\n\nforms the basis of the Zeroth Law of\n\nThermodynamics, which states that ‘two\n\nsystems in thermal equilibrium with a third\n\nsystem separately are in thermal equilibrium\n\nwith each other’.  R.H. Fowler formulated this\n\nlaw in 1931 long after the first and second Laws\n\nof thermodynamics were stated and so numbered.\n\nThe Zeroth Law clearly suggests that when two\nsystems A and B, are in thermal equilibrium,\nthere must be a physical quantity that has the\nsame value for both. This thermodynamic\nvariable whose value is equal for two systems in\nthermal equilibrium is called temperature (T ).\nThus, if A and B are separately in equilibrium\nwith C, TA = TC  and TB = TC.  This implies that\nTA = TB i.e. the systems A and B are also in\nthermal equilibrium.\n\nWe have arrived at the concept of temperature\nformally via the Zeroth Law.  The next question\nis : how to assign numerical values to\ntemperatures of different bodies ?  In other words,\nhow do we construct a scale of temperature ?\nThermometry deals with this basic question to\nwhich we turn in the next section.\n\nFig. 12.2 (a) Systems A and B are separated by an\nadiabatic wall, while each is in contact\n\nwith a third system C via a conducting\n\nwall. (b) The adiabatic wall between  A\n\nand B is replaced by a conducting wall,\n\nwhile C is insulated from A and B by an\n\nadiabatic wall.\n\n* Both the variables need not change. It depends on the constraints. For instance, if the gases are in containers\nof fixed volume, only the pressures of the gases would change to achieve thermal equilibrium.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS306\n\n12.4  HEAT, INTERNAL ENERGY AND WORK\n\nThe Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics led us to\nthe concept of temperature that agrees with our\n\ncommonsense notion.  Temperature is a marker\nof the ‘hotness’ of a body. It determines the\n\ndirection of flow of heat when two bodies are\nplaced in thermal contact.  Heat flows from the\nbody at a higher temperature to the one at lower\n\ntemperature. The flow stops when the\ntemperatures equalise; the two bodies are then\n\nin thermal equilibrium. We saw in some detail\nhow to construct temperature scales to assign\ntemperatures to different bodies. We now\n\ndescribe the concepts of heat and other relevant\nquantities like internal energy and work.\n\nThe concept of internal energy of a system is\nnot difficult to understand.  We know that every\nbulk system consists of a large number of\n\nmolecules.  Internal energy is simply the sum of\nthe kinetic energies and potential energies of\n\nthese molecules. We remarked earlier that in\nthermodynamics, the kinetic energy of the\nsystem, as a whole, is not relevant.  Internal\n\nenergy is thus, the sum of molecular kinetic and\npotential energies in the frame of reference\n\nrelative to which the centre of mass of the system\nis at rest. Thus, it includes only the (disordered)\n\nenergy associated with the random motion of\nmolecules of the system. We denote the internal\nenergy of a system by U.\n\nThough we have invoked the molecular\npicture to understand the meaning of internal\nenergy, as far as thermodynamics is concerned,\n\nU is simply a macroscopic variable of the system.\nThe important thing about internal energy is\n\nthat it depends only on the state of the system,\nnot on how that state was achieved.  Internal\n\nenergy U of a system is an example of a\nthermodynamic ‘state variable’ – its value\ndepends only on the given state of the system,\n\nnot on history i.e. not on the ‘path’ taken to arrive\nat that state. Thus, the internal energy of a given\n\nmass of gas depends on its state described by\nspecific values of pressure, volume and\ntemperature. It does not depend on how this\n\nstate of the gas came about. Pressure, volume,\ntemperature, and internal energy are\n\nthermodynamic state variables of the system\n(gas) (see section 12.7). If we neglect the small\n\nintermolecular forces in a gas, the internal\nenergy of a gas is just the sum of kinetic energies\n\nassociated with various random motions of its\nmolecules.  We will see in the next chapter that\nin a gas this motion is not only translational\n\n(i.e. motion from one point to another in the\nvolume of the container); it also includes\nrotational and vibrational motion of the\nmolecules (Fig. 12.3).\n\nFig. 12.3 (a) Internal energy U of a gas is the sum\nof the kinetic and potential energies of  its\n\nmolecules when the box is at rest. Kinetic\n\nenergy due to various types of motion\n\n(translational, rotational, vibrational) is to\n\nbe included in U.  (b) If the same box is\n\nmoving as a whole with some velocity,\n\nthe kinetic energy of the box is not to be\n\nincluded in U.\n\nFig. 12.4 Heat and work are two distinct modes of\nenergy transfer to a system that results  in\n\nchange in its internal energy. (a) Heat is\n\nenergy transfer due to temperature\n\ndifference between the system and the\n\nsurroundings.  (b) Work is energy transfer\n\nbrought about by means (e.g. moving the\n\npiston by raising or lowering some weight\n\nconnected to it) that do not involve such a\n\ntemperature difference.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTHERMODYNAMICS 307\n\nWhat are the ways of changing internal\nenergy of a system ? Consider again, for\nsimplicity, the system to be a certain mass of\ngas contained in a cylinder with a movable\npiston as shown in Fig. 12.4.  Experience shows\nthere are two ways of changing the state of the\ngas (and hence its internal energy).  One way is\nto put the cylinder in contact with a body at a\nhigher temperature than that of the gas. The\ntemperature difference will cause a flow of\nenergy (heat) from the hotter body to the gas,\nthus increasing the internal energy of the gas.\nThe other way is to push the piston down i.e. to\ndo work on the system, which again results in\nincreasing the internal energy of the gas.  Of\ncourse, both these things could happen in the\n\nreverse direction. With surroundings at a lower\ntemperature, heat would flow from the gas to\nthe surroundings.  Likewise, the gas could push\n\nthe piston up and do work on the surroundings.\nIn short, heat and work are two different modes\nof altering the state of a thermodynamic system\nand changing its internal energy.\n\nThe notion of heat should be carefully\ndistinguished from the notion of internal energy.\nHeat is certainly energy, but it is the energy in\ntransit.  This is not just a play of words.  The\ndistinction is of basic significance. The state of\na thermodynamic system is characterised by its\ninternal energy, not heat. A statement like ‘a\ngas in a given state has a certain amount of\nheat’ is as meaningless as the statement that\n‘a gas in a given state has a certain amount\nof work’.  In contrast, ‘a gas in a given state\nhas a certain amount of internal energy’ is a\nperfectly meaningful statement. Similarly, the\nstatements ‘a certain amount of heat is\nsupplied to the system’ or ‘a certain amount\nof work was done by the system’ are perfectly\nmeaningful.\n\nTo summarise, heat and work in\nthermodynamics are not state variables. They\nare modes of energy transfer to a system\n\nresulting in change in its internal energy,\nwhich, as already mentioned, is a state variable.\n\nIn ordinary language, we often confuse heat\n\nwith internal energy.  The distinction between\nthem is sometimes ignored in elementary\n\nphysics books. For proper understanding of\nthermodynamics, however, the distinction is\ncrucial.\n\n12.5  FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS\n\nWe have seen that the internal energy U of a\nsystem can change through two modes of energy\ntransfer : heat and work.  Let\n\n∆Q = Heat supplied to the system by the\nsurroundings\n\n∆W = Work done by the system on the\nsurroundings\n\n∆U = Change in internal energy of the system\nThe general principle of conservation of\n\nenergy then implies that\n\n∆Q =  ∆U + ∆W (12.1)\ni.e. the energy (∆Q) supplied to the system goes\nin partly to increase the internal energy of the\nsystem (∆U) and the rest in work on the\nenvironment (∆W). Equation (12.1) is known as\nthe First Law of Thermodynamics.  It is simply\nthe general law of conservation of energy applied\nto any system in which the energy transfer from\nor to the surroundings is taken into account.\n\nLet us put Eq. (12.1) in the alternative form\n\n∆Q  – ∆W  = ∆U (12.2)\n\nNow, the system may go from an initial state\nto the final state in a number of ways. For\nexample, to change the state of a gas from\n(P\n\n1\n, V\n\n1\n) to (P\n\n2\n, V\n\n2\n), we can first change the\n\nvolume of the gas from V\n1\n to V\n\n2\n, keeping its\n\npressure constant i.e. we can first go the state\n(P\n\n1\n, V\n\n2\n) and then change the pressure of the\n\ngas from P\n1\n to P\n\n2\n, keeping volume constant, to\n\ntake the gas to (P\n2\n, V\n\n2\n).  Alternatively, we can\n\nfirst keep the volume constant and then keep\nthe pressure constant. Since U is a state\nvariable, ∆U depends only on the initial and\nfinal states and not on the path taken by the\ngas to go from one to the other. However, ∆Q\nand ∆W will, in general, depend on the path\ntaken to go from the initial to final states. From\nthe First Law of Thermodynamics, Eq. (12.2),\nit is clear that the combination ∆Q – ∆W, is\nhowever, path independent. This shows that\nif a system is taken through a process in which\n∆U = 0 (for example, isothermal expansion of\nan ideal gas, see section 12.8),\n\n∆Q  = ∆W\n\ni.e., heat supplied to the system is used up\nentirely by the system in doing work on the\nenvironment.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS308\n\nIf the system is a gas in a cylinder with a\nmovable piston, the gas in moving the piston does\nwork. Since force is pressure times area, and\narea times displacement is volume, work done\nby the system against a constant pressure P is\n\n∆W  = P ∆V\n\nwhere ∆V is the change in volume of the gas.\nThus, for this case, Eq. (12.1) gives\n\n∆Q  = ∆U + P ∆V (12.3)\n\nAs an application of Eq. (12.3), consider the\n\nchange in internal energy for 1 g of water when\n\nwe go from its liquid to vapour phase. The\n\nmeasured latent heat of water is 2256 J/g. i.e.,\n\nfor 1 g of water ∆Q = 2256 J. At atmospheric\npressure, 1 g of water has a volume 1 cm3 in\nliquid phase and 1671 cm3 in vapour phase.\n\nTherefore,\n\n∆W =P (V\ng\n –V\n\nl \n) = 1.013 ×105 ×(1671×10–6) =169.2 J\n\nEquation (12.3) then gives\n\n∆U = 2256 – 169.2  =  2086.8 J\n\nWe see that most of the heat goes to increase\nthe internal energy of water in transition from\nthe liquid to the vapour phase.\n\n12.6  SPECIFIC HEAT CAPACITY\n\nSuppose an amount of heat ∆Q supplied to a\nsubstance changes its temperature from T to\nT + ∆T.  We define heat capacity of a substance\n(see Chapter 11) to be\n\nT\n\nQ\nS\n\n∆\n∆\n\n=  (12.4)\n\nWe expect ∆Q and, therefore, heat capacity S\nto be proportional to the mass of the substance.\nFurther, it could also depend on the\ntemperature, i.e., a different amount of heat may\nbe needed for a unit rise in temperature at\ndifferent temperatures. To define a constant\ncharacteristic of the substance and\nindependent of its amount, we divide S by the\nmass of the substance m  in kg :\n\ns\nS\n\nm m\n\nQ\n\nT\n    = = \uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n1 ∆\n∆ (12.5)\n\ns is known as the specific heat capacity of the\nsubstance. It depends on the nature of the\nsubstance and its temperature. The unit of\nspecific heat capacity is J kg–1 K–1.\n\nIf the amount of substance is specified in\nterms of moles µ (instead of mass m in kg ), we\ncan define heat capacity per mole of the\nsubstance by\n\n1S Q\nC\n\nTµ µ\n∆\n\n= =\n∆ (12.6)\n\nC is known as molar specific heat capacity of\nthe substance. Like s, C is independent of the\namount of substance. C depends on the nature\nof the substance, its temperature and the\nconditions under which heat is supplied. The\nunit of C is J mo1–1 K–1. As we shall see later (in\nconnection with specific heat capacity of gases),\nadditional conditions may be needed to define\nC or s. The idea in defining C is that simple\npredictions can be made in regard to molar\nspecific heat capacities.\n\nTable 12.1 lists measured specific and molar\nheat capacities of solids at atmospheric pressure\nand ordinary room temperature.\n\nWe will see in Chapter 13 that predictions of\nspecific heats of gases generally agree with\nexperiment. We can use the same law of\nequipartition of energy that we use there to\npredict molar specific heat capacities of solids\n(See Section 13.5 and 13.6).  Consider a solid of\nN atoms, each vibrating about its mean\nposition. An oscillator in one dimension has\naverage energy of 2 × ½ k\n\nB\nT = k\n\nB\nT. In three\n\ndimensions, the average energy is 3 k\nB\nT.\n\nFor a mole of a solid, the total energy is\n\nU  = 3 k\nB\nT  × N\n\nA\n  = 3 RT  (∵kBT  × NA = R )\n\nNow, at constant pressure, ∆Q = ∆U + P ∆V ≅\n∆U,  since for a solid ∆V is negligible.

One calorie\nwas earlier defined to be the amount of heat\nrequired to raise the temperature of 1g of water\nby 1°C. With more precise measurements, it was\nfound that the specific heat of water varies\nslightly with temperature.  Figure 12.5 shows\nthis variation in the temperature range 0 to\n100 °C.\n\nFig. 12.5 Variation of specific heat capacity of water\n\nwith temperature.\n\nFor a precise definition of calorie, it was,\n\ntherefore, necessary to specify the unit\n\ntemperature interval. One calorie is defined\n\nto be the amount of heat required to raise the\n\ntemperature of 1g of water from 14.5 °C to\n\n15.5 °C. Since heat is just a form of energy,\n\nit is preferable to use the unit joule, J.\n\nIn SI units, the specific heat capacity of water\n\nis 4186 J kg\n–1\n\n K\n–1\n\n i.e. 4.186 J g\n–1\n\n K\n–1\n\n. The so\n\ncalled mechanical equivalent of heat defined\n\nas the amount of work needed to produce\n\n1 cal of heat is in fact just a conversion factor\n\nbetween two different units of energy : calorie\n\nto joule. Since in SI units, we use the unit joule\n\nfor heat, work or any other form of energy, the\n\nterm mechanical equivalent is now\n\nsuperfluous and need not be used.\n\nAs already remarked, the specific heat\n\ncapacity depends on the process or the\n\nconditions under which heat capacity transfer\n\ntakes place.  For gases, for example, we can\n\ndefine two specific heats : specific heat\n\ncapacity at constant volume and specific\nheat capacity at constant pressure.  For an\n\nideal gas, we have a simple relation.\n\n        C\np\n  –  C\n\nv\n = R (12.8)\n\nwhere C\np\n and C\n\nv\n  are molar specific heat\n\ncapacities of an ideal gas at constant pressure\n\nand volume respectively and R is the universal\n\ngas constant.  To prove the relation, we begin\n\nwith Eq. (12.3) for 1 mole of the gas :\n\n                ∆Q  = ∆U + P ∆V\n\nIf ∆Q  is absorbed at constant volume, ∆V = 0\n\n   C\nQ\n\nT\n\nU\n\nT\n\nU\n\nT\nv\n\nv v\n\n= \uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n= \uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n= \uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n∆\n∆\n\n∆\n∆\n\n∆\n∆ (12.9)\n\nwhere the subscript v is dropped in the last\nstep, since U of an ideal gas depends only on\ntemperature. (The subscript denotes the\nquantity kept fixed.) If, on the other hand, ∆Q\nis absorbed at constant pressure,\n\nC\nQ\n\nT\n\nU\n\nT\n P\n\nV\n\nT\np\n\np p p\n\n   =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n=\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n+\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n∆\n∆\n\n∆\n∆\n\n∆\n∆ (12.10)\n\nThe subscript p can be dropped from the\nfirst term since U of an ideal gas depends only\non T.

(12.8).\n\n12.7 THERMODYNAMIC STATE VARIABLES\nAND EQUATION OF STATE\n\nEvery equilibrium state of a thermodynamic\nsystem is completely described by specific\n\nvalues of some macroscopic variables, also\n\ncalled state variables. For example, an\n\nequilibrium state of a gas is completely\n\nspecified by the values of pressure, volume,\ntemperature, and mass (and composition if\n\nthere is a mixture of gases). A thermodynamic\n\nsystem is not always in equilibrium. For example,\n\na gas allowed to expand freely  against vacuum\n\nis not an equilibrium state [Fig. 12.6(a)]. During\n\nthe rapid expansion, pressure of the gas may\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS310\n\nnot be uniform throughout. Similarly, a mixture\n\nof gases undergoing an explosive chemical\n\nreaction (e.g. a mixture of petrol vapour and\n\nair when ignited by a spark) is not an\n\nequilibrium state; again its temperature and\n\npressure are not uniform [Fig. 12.6(b)].\n\nEventually, the gas attains a uniform\n\ntemperature and pressure and comes to\n\nthermal and mechanical equilibrium with its\n\nsurroundings.\n\nFig. 12.6 (a) The partition in the box is suddenly\nremoved leading to free expansion of the\n\ngas. (b) A mixture of gases undergoing an\n\nexplosive chemical reaction. In both\n\nsituations, the gas is not in equilibrium and\n\ncannot be described by state variables.\n\nIn short, thermodynamic state variables\ndescribe equilibrium states of systems. The\nvarious state variables are not necessarily\nindependent. The connection between the state\nvariables is called the equation of state. For\nexample, for an ideal gas, the equation of state\nis the ideal gas relation\n\n   P V = µ R T\nFor a fixed amount of the gas i.e. given µ, there\n\nare thus, only two independent variables, say P\nand V or T and V.  The pressure-volume curve\nfor a fixed temperature is called an isotherm.\nReal gases may have more complicated\nequations of state.\n\nThe thermodynamic state variables are of two\nkinds: extensive and intensive. Extensive\nvariables indicate the ‘size’ of the system.\nIntensive variables such as pressure and\n\ntemperature do not. To decide which variable is\nextensive and which intensive, think of a\nrelevant system in equilibrium, and imagine that\nit is divided into two equal parts. The variables\nthat remain unchanged for each part are\nintensive. The variables whose values get halved\nin each part are extensive. It is easily seen, for\nexample, that internal energy U, volume V, total\nmass M are extensive variables. Pressure P,\ntemperature T, and density ρ are intensive\nvariables.  It is a good practice to check the\nconsistency of thermodynamic equations using\nthis classification of variables. For example, in\nthe equation\n\n      ∆Q = ∆U + P ∆V\n\nquantities on both sides are extensive*. (The\nproduct of an intensive variable like P and an\nextensive quantity ∆V is extensive.)\n\n12.8  THERMODYNAMIC PROCESSES\n\n12.8.1  Quasi-static process\n\nConsider a gas in thermal and mechanical\nequilibrium with its surroundings. The pressure\nof the gas in that case equals the external\npressure and its temperature is the same as\nthat of its surroundings. Suppose that the\nexternal pressure is suddenly reduced (say by\nlifting the weight on the movable piston in the\ncontainer).  The piston will accelerate outward.\nDuring the process, the gas passes through\nstates that are not equilibrium states. The non-\nequilibrium states do not have well-defined\npressure and temperature. In the same way, if\na finite temperature difference exists between\nthe gas and its surroundings, there will be a\nrapid exchange of heat during which the gas\nwill pass through non-equilibrium states.  In\ndue course, the gas will settle to an equilibrium\nstate with well-defined temperature and\npressure equal to those of the surroundings. The\nfree expansion of a gas in vacuum and a mixture\nof gases undergoing an explosive chemical\nreaction, mentioned in section 12.7 are also\nexamples where the system goes through non-\nequilibrium states.\n\nNon-equilibrium states of a system are difficult\nto deal with.  It is, therefore, convenient to\nimagine an idealised process in which at every\nstage the system is an equilibrium state. Such a\n\n* As emphasised earlier, Q is not a state variable.  However, ∆Q is clearly proportional to the total mass of\nsystem and hence is extensive.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTHERMODYNAMICS 311\n\nprocess is, in principle, infinitely slow, hence the\nname quasi-static (meaning nearly static). The\nsystem changes its variables (P, T, V ) so slowly\n\nthat it remains in thermal and mechanical\nequilibrium with its surroundings throughout.\n\nIn a quasi-static process, at every stage, the\ndifference in the pressure of the system and the\nexternal pressure is infinitesimally small.  The\n\nsame is true of the temperature difference\nbetween the system and its surroundings\n\n(Fig.12.7).  To take a gas from the state (P, T ) to\nanother state (P ′, T ′ ) via  a quasi-static process,\nwe change the external pressure by a very small\namount, allow the system to equalise its pressure\nwith that of the surroundings and continue the\n\nprocess infinitely slowly until the system\nachieves the pressure P ′. Similarly, to change\nthe temperature, we introduce an infinitesimal\ntemperature difference between the system and\nthe surrounding reservoirs and by choosing\n\nreservoirs of progressively different temperatures\nT to T ′, the system achieves the temperature T ′.\n\nFig. 12.7 In a quasi-static process, the temperature\n\nof the surrounding reservoir and the\n\nexternal pressure differ only infinitesimally\n\nfrom the temperature and pressure of the\n\nsystem.\n\nA quasi-static process is obviously a\n\nhypothetical construct.  In practice, processes\n\nthat are sufficiently slow and do not involve\n\naccelerated motion of the piston, large\n\ntemperature gradient, etc., are reasonably\n\napproximation to an ideal quasi-static process.\n\nWe shall from now on deal with quasi-static\n\nprocesses only, except when stated otherwise.\n\nA process in which the temperature of the\nsystem is kept fixed throughout is called an\nisothermal process.  The expansion of a gas in\na metallic cylinder placed in a large reservoir of\nfixed temperature is an example of an isothermal\nprocess.  (Heat transferred from the reservoir to\nthe system does not materially affect the\ntemperature of the reservoir, because of its very\nlarge heat capacity.)  In isobaric processes the\npressure is constant while in isochoric\nprocesses the volume is constant.  Finally, if\nthe system is insulated from the surroundings\nand no heat flows between the system and the\nsurroundings, the process is adiabatic. The\ndefinitions of these special processes are\nsummarised in Table. 12.2\n\nTable 12.2 Some special thermodynamic\nprocesses\n\nWe now consider these processes in some detail :\n\n12.8.2 Isothermal process\n\nFor an isothermal process (T fixed), the ideal gas\nequation gives\n\n                  PV  =  constant\n\ni.e., pressure of a given mass of gas varies inversely\nas its volume. This is nothing but Boyle’s Law.\n\nSuppose an ideal gas goes isothermally (at\ntemperature T ) from its initial state (P\n\n1\n, V\n\n1\n) to\n\nthe final state (P\n2\n, V \n\n2\n).  At any intermediate stage\n\nwith pressure P and volume change from V to\nV + ∆V (∆V small)\n\n     ∆W  = P ∆ V\n\nTaking (∆V → 0) and summing the quantity\n∆W over the entire process,\n\nW = P V\n\nV\n\nV\n\n1\n\n2\n\n d∫\n\n=  RT\n\nV\n\nV\n\nRT    \nV\n\nV\n\nV\n\nV\n1\n\n2\n2\n\n1\n\nµ µ\nd\n\n∫ =    In (12.12)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS312\n\nwhere in the second  step we have made use of\nthe ideal gas equation PV = µ RT and  taken the\nconstants out of the integral.  For an ideal gas,\ninternal energy depends only on temperature.\nThus, there is no change in the internal energy\nof an ideal gas in an isothermal process. The\nFirst Law of Thermodynamics then implies that\nheat supplied to the gas equals the work done\nby the gas : Q = W.  Note from Eq. (12.12) that\nfor V\n\n2\n > V\n\n1\n,  W > 0; and for V\n\n2\n < V\n\n1\n, W < 0.  That\n\nis, in an isothermal expansion, the gas absorbs\nheat and does work while in an isothermal\ncompression, work is  done on the gas by the\nenvironment and heat is released.\n\n12.8.3 Adiabatic process\n\nIn an adiabatic process, the system is insulated\nfrom the surroundings and heat absorbed or\nreleased is zero. From Eq. (12.1), we see that\nwork done by the gas results in decrease in its\ninternal energy (and hence its temperature for\nan ideal gas).  We quote without proof (the result\nthat you will learn in higher courses) that for\nan adiabatic process of an ideal gas.\n\n    P V γ   =  const (12.13)\n\nwhere γ  is the ratio of specific heats (ordinary\nor molar) at constant pressure and at constant\nvolume.\n\n               γ =\nC\n\np\n\nC\nv\n\nThus if an ideal gas undergoes a change in\nits state adiabatically from (P\n\n1\n, V\n\n1\n) to (P\n\n2\n, V\n\n2\n) :\n\nP\n1\n V\n\n1\n\nγ  = P\n2\n V\n\n2\n\nγ\n(12.14)\n\nFigure12.8 shows the P-V curves of an ideal\ngas for two adiabatic processes connecting two\nisotherms.\n\nFig. 12.8 P-V curves for isothermal and adiabatic\n\nprocesses of an ideal gas.\n\nWe can calculate, as before, the work done in\nan adiabatic change of an ideal gas from the\nstate (P\n\n1\n, V\n\n1\n, T\n\n1\n) to the state (P\n\n2\n, V\n\n2\n, T\n\n2\n).\n\n         W = P V\n\nV\n\nV\n\n  d\n\n1\n\n2\n\n∫\n\n(12.15)\n\nFrom Eq. (12.14), the constant is P\n1\nV\n\n1\nγ  or P\n\n2\nV\n\n2\nγ\n\nW = \nP V\n\nV\n\nP V\n\nV\n \n\n2 2\n\n2\n\n1 1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1  − − −\n−\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ef\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8fb\n\uf8fa\n\nγ\n\nγ\n\nγ\n\nγ\n\nγ1 1\n\n = P V P V\nR(T T1\n\n1  −\n−\n\n−\n\n−\n[ ] =\n\nγ\n\nµ\n\nγ\n2 2 1 1\n\n1 2 )\n\n1\n(12.16)\n\nAs expected, if work is done by the gas in an\n\nadiabatic process (W > 0), from Eq. (12.16),\n\nT\n2\n < T\n\n1\n.  On the other hand, if work is done on\n\nthe gas (W < 0), we get T\n2\n > T\n\n1\n i.e., the\n\ntemperature of the gas rises.\n\n12.8.4 Isochoric process\n\nIn an isochoric process, V is constant. No work\nis done on or by the gas.  From Eq. (12.1), the\nheat absorbed by the gas goes entirely to change\nits internal energy and its temperature.  The\nchange in temperature for a given amount of\nheat is determined by the specific heat of the\ngas at constant volume.\n\n12.8.5 Isobaric process\n\nIn an isobaric process, P is fixed. Work done by\nthe gas is\n\nW = P (V\n2\n – V\n\n1\n)  =  µ R (T\n\n2\n – T\n\n1\n)    (12.17)\n\nSince temperature changes, so does internal\n\nenergy. The heat absorbed goes partly to\nincrease internal energy and partly to do work.\n\nThe change in temperature for a given amount\nof heat is determined by the specific heat of the\ngas at constant pressure.\n\n12.8.6 Cyclic process\n\nIn a cyclic process, the system returns to its\ninitial state. Since internal energy is a state\nvariable, ∆U = 0 for a cyclic process. From\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTHERMODYNAMICS 313\n\nEq. (12.1), the total heat absorbed equals the\nwork done by the system.\n\n12.9  HEAT ENGINES\n\nHeat engine is a device by which a system is\nmade to undergo a cyclic process that results\nin conversion of heat to work.\n(1) It consists of a working substance–the\n\nsystem. For example, a mixture of fuel\nvapour and air in a gasoline or diesel engine\nor steam in a steam engine are the working\nsubstances.\n\n(2) The working substance goes through a cycle\nconsisting of several processes. In some of\nthese processes, it absorbs a total amount\nof heat Q\n\n1\n from an external reservoir at some\n\nhigh temperature T\n1\n.\n\n(3) In some other processes of the cycle, the\nworking substance releases a total amount\nof heat Q\n\n2\n to an external reservoir at some\n\nlower temperature T\n2\n.\n\n(4) The work done (W ) by the system in a cycle\nis transferred to the environment via some\narrangement (e.g. the working substance\nmay be in a cylinder with a moving piston\nthat transfers mechanical energy to the\nwheels of a vehicle via a shaft).\n\nThe basic features of a heat engine are\nschematically represented in Fig. 12.9.\n\nFig. 12.9 Schematic representation of a heat engine.\nThe engine takes heat Q\n\n1\n from a hot\n\nreservoir at temperature T\n1\n, releases heat\n\nQ\n2\n to a cold reservoir at temperature T\n\n2\n\nand delivers work W to the surroundings.\n\nThe cycle is repeated again and again to get\nuseful work for some purpose. The discipline of\nthermodynamics has its roots in the study of heat\nengines. A basic question relates to the efficiency\nof a heat engine. The efficiency (η) of a heat\nengine is defined by\n\n1Q\n\nW\n = η (12.18)\n\nwhere Q\n1\n is the heat input i.e., the heat\n\nabsorbed by the system in one complete cycle\n\nand W is the work done on the environment in\na cycle. In a cycle, a certain amount of heat (Q\n\n2\n)\n\nmay also be rejected to the environment. Then,\naccording to the First Law of Thermodynamics,\nover one complete cycle,\n\nW  =  Q\n1\n – Q\n\n2\n(12.19)\n\ni.e.,\n\n1Q\n2Q −  = 1η (12.20)\n\nFor Q\n2\n = 0, η = 1, i.e., the engine will have\n\n100% efficiency in converting heat into work.\nNote that the First Law of Thermodynamics i.e.,\nthe energy conservation law does not rule out\nsuch an engine. But experience shows that\nsuch an ideal engine with η = 1 is never possible,\neven if we can eliminate various kinds of losses\nassociated with actual heat engines. It turns\nout that there is a fundamental limit on the\nefficiency of a heat engine set by an independent\nprinciple of nature, called the Second Law of\nThermodynamics (section 12.11).\n\nThe mechanism of conversion of heat into\nwork varies for different heat engines.  Basically,\nthere are two ways : the system (say a gas or a\nmixture of gases) is heated by an external\nfurnace, as in a steam engine; or it is heated\ninternally by an exothermic chemical reaction\nas in an internal combustion engine. The\nvarious steps involved in a cycle also differ from\none engine to another.\n\n12.10  REFRIGERATORS AND HEAT PUMPS\n\nA refrigerator is the reverse of a heat engine.\nHere the working substance extracts heat Q\n\n2\n\nfrom the cold reservoir at temperature T\n2\n, some\n\nexternal work W is done on it and heat Q\n1\n is\n\nreleased to the hot reservoir at temperature T\n1\n\n(Fig. 12.10).\n\nFig. 12.10 Schematic representation of a refrigerator\nor a heat pump, the reverse of a heat\n\nengine.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS314\n\nA heat pump is the same as a refrigerator.\n\nWhat term we use depends on the purpose of\n\nthe device.  If the purpose is to cool a portion of\n\nspace, like the inside of a chamber, and higher\n\ntemperature reservoir is surrounding, we call\n\nthe device a refrigerator; if the idea is to pump\n\nheat into a portion of space (the room in a\n\nbuilding when the outside environment is cold),\n\nthe device is called a heat pump.\n\nIn a refrigerator the working substance\n\n(usually, in gaseous form) goes through the\n\nfollowing steps : (a) sudden expansion of the gas\n\nfrom high to low pressure which cools it and\n\nconverts it into a vapour-liquid mixture, (b)\n\nabsorption by the cold fluid of heat from the\n\nregion to be cooled converting it into vapour, (c)\n\nheating up of the vapour due to external work\n\ndone on the system, and (d) release of heat by\n\nthe vapour to the surroundings, bringing it to\n\nthe initial state and completing the cycle.\n\nThe coefficient of performance (α) of a\nrefrigerator is given by\n\n2Q\n\nW\nα =  (12.21)\n\nwhere Q\n2\n is the heat extracted from the cold\n\nreservoir and W is the work done on the\nsystem–the refrigerant. (α for heat pump is\ndefined as Q\n\n1\n/W) Note that while η by definition\n\ncan never exceed 1, α can be greater than 1.\nBy energy conservation, the heat released to the\nhot reservoir is\n\nQ\n1\n  = W +  Q\n\n2\n\ni.e.,\n2\n\n1 2–\n\nQ\n\nQ Q\nα  = \n\n  (12.22)\n\nIn a heat engine, heat cannot be fully\nconverted to work; likewise a refrigerator cannot\nwork without some external work done on the\nsystem, i.e., the coefficient of performance in Eq.\n(12.21) cannot be infinite.\n\n12.11  SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS\n\nThe First Law of Thermodynamics is the principle\n\nof conservation of energy.  Common experience\n\nshows that there are many conceivable\nprocesses that are perfectly allowed by the First\n\nLaw and yet are never observed.  For example,\n\nnobody has ever seen a book lying on a table\n\njumping to a height by itself.  But such a thing\n\nPioneers of Thermodynamics\n\nLord Kelvin (William Thomson)  (1824-1907), born in Belfast, Ireland, is\n\namong the foremost British scientists of the nineteenth century.  Thomson\n\nplayed a key role in the development of the law of conservation of energy\n\nsuggested by the work of James Joule (1818-1889), Julius Mayer (1814-\n\n1878) and Hermann Helmholtz (1821-1894). He collaborated with Joule\n\non the so-called Joule-Thomson effect : cooling of a gas when it expands\n\ninto vacuum.  He introduced the notion of the absolute zero of temperature\n\nand proposed the absolute temperature scale, now called the Kelvin scale\n\nin his honour.  From the work of Sadi Carnot (1796-1832), Thomson arrived\n\nat a form of the Second Law of Thermodynamics.  Thomson was a versatile\n\nphysicist, with notable contributions to electromagnetic theory and\n\nhydrodynamics.\n\nRudolf Clausius (1822-1888), born in Poland, is generally regarded as\n\nthe discoverer of the Second Law of Thermodynamics.  Based on the work\n\nof Carnot and Thomson, Clausius arrived at the important notion of entropy\n\nthat led him to a fundamental version of the Second Law of\n\nThermodynamics that states that the entropy of an isolated system can\n\nnever decrease. Clausius also worked on the kinetic theory of gases and\n\nobtained the first reliable estimates of molecular size, speed, mean free\n\npath, etc.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTHERMODYNAMICS 315\n\nwould be possible if the principle of conservation\n\nof energy were the only restriction. The table\n\ncould cool spontaneously, converting some of its\ninternal energy into an equal amount of\n\nmechanical energy of the book, which would\n\nthen hop to a height with potential energy equal\n\nto the mechanical energy it acquired.  But this\n\nnever happens. Clearly, some additional basic\n\nprinciple of nature forbids the above, even\nthough it satisfies the energy conservation\n\nprinciple.  This principle, which disallows many\n\nphenomena consistent with the First Law of\nThermodynamics is known as the Second Law\nof Thermodynamics.\n\nThe Second Law of Thermodynamics gives a\nfundamental limitation to the efficiency of a heat\nengine and the co-efficient of performance of a\nrefrigerator. In simple terms, it says that\nefficiency of a heat engine can never be unity.\nAccording to Eq. (12.20), this implies that heat\nreleased to the cold reservoir can never be made\nzero. For a refrigerator, the Second Law says that\nthe co-efficient of performance can never be\ninfinite.  According to Eq. (12.21), this implies\nthat external work (W ) can never be zero. The\nfollowing two statements, one due to Kelvin and\nPlanck denying the possibility of a perfect heat\nengine, and another due to Clausius denying\nthe possibility of a perfect refrigerator or heat\npump, are a concise summary of these\nobservations.\n\nKelvin-Planck statement\n\nNo process is possible whose sole result is the\nabsorption of heat from a reservoir and the\ncomplete conversion of the heat into work.\n\nClausius statement\n\nNo process is possible whose sole result is the\ntransfer of heat from a colder object to a hotter\nobject.\n\nIt can be proved that the two statements\nabove are completely equivalent.\n\n12.12  REVERSIBLE AND IRREVERSIBLE\nPROCESSES\n\nImagine some process in which a thermodynamic\nsystem goes from an initial state i to a final\nstate f. During the process the system absorbs\nheat Q from the surroundings and performs\nwork W on it. Can we reverse this process and\n\nbring both the system and surroundings to their\n\ninitial states with no other effect anywhere ?\n\nExperience suggests that for most processes in\n\nnature this is not possible. The spontaneous\n\nprocesses of nature are irreversible. Several\nexamples can be cited. The base of a vessel on\n\nan oven is hotter than its other parts. When\n\nthe vessel is removed, heat is transferred from\n\nthe base to the other parts, bringing the vessel\n\nto a uniform temperature (which in due course\n\ncools to the temperature of the surroundings).\nThe process cannot be reversed; a part of the\n\nvessel will not get cooler spontaneously and\n\nwarm up the base. It will violate the Second Law\n\nof Thermodynamics, if it did. The free expansion\n\nof a gas is irreversible. The combustion reaction\n\nof a mixture of petrol and air ignited by a spark\ncannot be reversed. Cooking gas leaking from a\n\ngas cylinder in the kitchen diffuses to the\n\nentire room. The diffusion process will not\n\nspontaneously reverse and bring the gas back\n\nto the cylinder. The stirring of a liquid in thermal\n\ncontact with a reservoir will convert the work\ndone into heat, increasing the internal energy\n\nof the reservoir. The process cannot be reversed\n\nexactly; otherwise it would amount to conversion\n\nof heat entirely into work, violating the Second\n\nLaw of Thermodynamics. Irreversibility is a rule\n\nrather an exception in nature.\nIrreversibility arises mainly from two causes:\n\none, many processes (like a free expansion, or\n\nan explosive chemical reaction) take the system\n\nto non-equilibrium states; two, most processes\n\ninvolve friction, viscosity and other dissipative\n\neffects (e.g., a moving body coming to a stop and\nlosing its mechanical energy as heat to the floor\n\nand the body; a rotating blade in a liquid coming\n\nto a stop due to viscosity and losing its\n\nmechanical energy with corresponding gain in\n\nthe internal energy  of the liquid). Since\n\ndissipative effects are present everywhere and\ncan be minimised but not fully eliminated, most\n\nprocesses that we deal with are irreversible.\n\nA thermodynamic process  (state i → state f )\nis reversible if the process can be turned back\n\nsuch that both the system and the surroundings\n\nreturn to their original states, with no other\n\nchange anywhere else in the universe. From the\n\npreceding discussion, a reversible process is an\n\nidealised notion. A process is reversible only if\n\nit is quasi-static (system in equilibrium with the\n\nsurroundings at every stage) and there are no\n\ndissipative effects. For example, a quasi-static\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS316\n\nisothermal expansion of an ideal gas in a\ncylinder fitted with a frictionless movable piston\nis a reversible process.\n\nWhy is reversibility such a basic concept in\nthermodynamics ?  As we have seen, one of the\nconcerns of thermodynamics is the efficiency\nwith which heat can be converted into work.\nThe Second Law of Thermodynamics rules out\nthe possibility of a perfect heat engine with 100%\nefficiency. But what is the highest efficiency\npossible for a heat engine working between two\nreservoirs at temperatures T\n\n1\n and T\n\n2\n? It turns\n\nout that a heat engine based on idealised\nreversible processes achieves the highest\nefficiency possible. All other engines involving\nirreversibility in any way (as would be the case\nfor practical engines) have lower than this\nlimiting efficiency.\n\n12.13  CARNOT ENGINE\n\nSuppose we have a hot reservoir at temperature\n\nT\n1\n and a cold reservoir at temperature T\n\n2\n.  What\n\nis the maximum efficiency possible for a heat\n\nengine operating between the two reservoirs and\n\nwhat cycle of processes should be adopted to\n\nachieve the maximum efficiency ?  Sadi Carnot,\n\na French engineer, first considered this question\n\nin 1824. Interestingly, Carnot arrived at the\n\ncorrect answer, even though the basic concepts\n\nof heat and thermodynamics had yet to be firmly\n\nestablished.\n\nWe expect the ideal engine operating between\n\ntwo temperatures to be a reversible engine.\n\nIrreversibility is associated with dissipative\n\neffects, as remarked in the preceding section,\n\nand lowers efficiency. A process is reversible if\n\nit is quasi-static and non-dissipative.  We have\n\nseen that a process is not quasi-static if it\n\ninvolves finite temperature difference between\n\nthe system and the reservoir.  This implies that\n\nin a reversible heat engine operating between\ntwo temperatures, heat should be absorbed\n\n(from the hot reservoir) isothermally and\n\nreleased (to the cold reservoir) isothermally.  We\n\nthus have identified two steps of the reversible\n\nheat engine : isothermal process at temperature\nT\n\n1\n absorbing heat Q\n\n1\n from the hot reservoir, and\n\nanother isothermal process at temperature T\n2\n\nreleasing heat Q\n2\n to the cold reservoir. To\n\ncomplete a cycle, we need to take the system\n\nfrom temperature T\n1\n to T\n\n2\n and then back from\n\ntemperature T\n2\n to T\n\n1\n.  Which processes should\n\nwe employ for this purpose that are reversible?\nA little reflection shows that we can only adopt\nreversible adiabatic processes for these\npurposes, which involve no heat flow from any\nreservoir. If we employ any other process that is\nnot adiabatic, say an isochoric process, to take\nthe system from one temperature to another, we\nshall need a series of reservoirs in the\ntemperature range T\n\n2\n to T\n\n1\n to ensure that at each\n\nstage the process is quasi-static.  (Remember\nagain that for a process to be quasi-static and\nreversible, there should be no finite temperature\ndifference between the system and the reservoir.)\nBut we are considering a reversible engine that\noperates between only two temperatures. Thus\nadiabatic processes must bring about the\ntemperature change in the system from T\n\n1\n to T\n\n2\n\nand T\n2\n to T\n\n1\n in this engine.\n\nFig. 12.11 Carnot cycle for a heat engine with an\nideal gas as  the working substance.\n\nA reversible heat engine operating between\ntwo temperatures is called a Carnot engine.  We\nhave just argued that such an engine must have\n\nthe following sequence of steps constituting one\n\ncycle, called the Carnot cycle, shown in Fig.\n\n12.11. We have taken the working substance of\n\nthe Carnot engine to be an ideal gas.\n\n(a) Step 1 → 2 Isothermal expansion of the gas\ntaking its  state from (P\n\n1\n, V\n\n1\n, T\n\n1\n)  to\n\n(P\n2\n, V\n\n2\n, T\n\n1\n).\n\nThe heat absorbed by the gas (Q\n1\n) from the\n\nreservoir at temperature T\n1\n is given by\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTHERMODYNAMICS 317\n\nEq.

Indeed it is the only\n\nreversible engine possible that works between\n\ntwo reservoirs at different temperatures.  Each\n\nstep of the Carnot cycle given in Fig. 12.11 can\n\nbe reversed. This will amount to taking heat Q\n2\n\nfrom the cold reservoir at T\n2\n, doing work W on\n\nthe system, and transferring heat Q\n1\n to the hot\n\nreservoir. This will be a reversible refrigerator.\n\nWe next establish the important result\n\n(sometimes called Carnot’s theorem) that\n\n(a) working between two given temperatures T\n1\n\nand T\n2\n of the hot and cold reservoirs respectively,\n\nno engine can have efficiency more than that of\n\nthe Carnot engine and (b) the efficiency of the\n\nCarnot engine is independent of the nature of\n\nthe working substance.\n\nTo prove the result (a), imagine a reversible\n(Carnot) engine R and an irreversible engine I\nworking between the same source (hot reservoir)\nand sink (cold reservoir). Let us couple the\nengines, I and R, in such a way so that I acts\nlike a heat engine and R acts as a refrigerator.\nLet I absorb heat Q\n\n1\n from the source, deliver\n\nwork W ′ and release the heat Q\n1\n- W′   to the sink.\n\nWe arrange so that R returns the same heat Q\n1\n\nto the source, taking heat Q\n2\n from the sink and\n\nrequiring work W = Q\n1\n – Q\n\n2\n to be done on it.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS318\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. The zeroth law of thermodynamics states that ‘two systems in thermal equilibrium with a\nthird system separately are in thermal equilibrium with each other’.  The Zeroth Law leads\nto the concept of temperature.\n\n2. Internal energy of a system is the sum of kinetic energies and potential energies of the\nmolecular constituents of the system. It does not include the over-all kinetic energy of\nthe system. Heat and work are two modes of energy transfer to the system.  Heat is the\nenergy transfer arising due to temperature difference between the system and the\nsurroundings. Work is energy transfer brought about by other means, such as moving\nthe piston of a cylinder containing the gas, by raising or lowering some weight connected\nto it.\n\n3. The first law of thermodynamics is the general law of conservation of energy applied to\nany system in which energy transfer from or to the surroundings (through heat and\nwork) is taken into account.  It states that\n\n∆Q  = ∆U  +  ∆W\n\nwhere ∆Q is the heat supplied to the system, ∆W is the work done by the system and ∆U\nis the change in internal energy of the system.\n\nNow suppose η\nR\n < η\n\nI\n i.e. if R were to act\n\nas an engine it would give less work output\nthan that of I i.e. W < W ′ for a given Q\n\n1\n. With R\n\nacting like a refrigerator, this would mean\nQ\n\n2\n =  Q\n\n1\n – W >  Q\n\n1\n – W ′. Thus, on the  whole,\n\nthe coupled I-R system extracts heat\n(Q\n\n1\n – W) – (Q\n\n1\n – W ′) = (W ′ – W ) from the cold\n\nreservoir and delivers the same amount of  work\nin one cycle, without any change in the source\nor anywhere else. This is clearly against the\nKelvin-Planck statement of the Second Law of\nThermodynamics.  Hence the assertion η\n\nI\n > η\n\nR\n\nis wrong.  No engine can have efficiency greater\n\nthan that of the Carnot engine. A similar\nargument can be constructed to show that a\nreversible engine with one particular substance\ncannot be more efficient than the one using\nanother substance. The maximum efficiency of\na Carnot engine given by Eq. (12.32) is\nindependent of the nature of the system\nperforming the Carnot cycle of operations. Thus\nwe are justified in using an ideal gas as a system\nin the calculation of efficiency η of a Carnot\nengine. The ideal gas has a simple equation of\nstate, which allows us to readily calculate η, but\nthe final result for η, [Eq. (12.32)], is true for\nany Carnot engine.\n\nThis final remark shows that in a Carnot\ncycle,\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\nT\n\nT\n= \n\nQ\n\nQ\n(12.33)\n\nis a universal relation independent of  the nature\nof the system.  Here Q\n\n1\n and Q\n\n2\n are respectively,\n\nthe heat absorbed and released isothermally\n(from the hot and to the cold reservoirs) in a\nCarnot engine. Equation (12.33), can, therefore,\nbe used as a relation to define a truly universal\nthermodynamic temperature scale that is\nindependent of any particular properties of the\nsystem used in the Carnot cycle.  Of course, for\nan ideal gas as a working substance, this\nuniversal temperature is the same as the ideal\n\ngas temperature introduced in section 12.11.\n\nI\n\nR\n\nW\n\nFig. 12.12 An irreversible engine (I) coupled to a\n\nreversible refrigerator (R). If W ′ > W, this\nwould amount to extraction of heat\n\nW ′ – W from the sink and its full\nconversion to work, in contradiction with\n\nthe Second Law of Thermodynamics.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTHERMODYNAMICS 319\n\n4. The specific heat capacity of a substance is defined by\n\ns\nm\n\nQ\n\nT\n=\n\n1 ∆\n∆\n\nwhere m is the mass of the substance and ∆Q is the heat required to change its\ntemperature by ∆T.  The molar specific heat capacity of a substance is defined by\n\n1 Q\nC\n\nTµ\n∆\n\n=\n∆\n\nwhere µ is the number  of moles of the substance. For a solid, the law of equipartition\nof energy gives\n\nC  =  3 R\n\nwhich generally agrees with experiment at ordinary temperatures.\n\nCalorie is the old unit of heat. 1 calorie is the amount of heat required to raise the\ntemperature of 1 g of water from 14.5 °C to 15.5 °C.  1 cal  =  4.186 J.\n\n5. For an ideal gas, the molar specific heat capacities at constant pressure and volume\nsatisfy the relation\n\nC\np\n – C\n\nv\n  = R\n\nwhere R is the universal gas constant.\n\n6. Equilibrium states of a thermodynamic system are described by state variables. The\nvalue of a state variable depends only on the particular state, not on the path used to\narrive at that state.  Examples of state variables are pressure (P ), volume (V ), temperature\n(T ), and mass (m ).  Heat and work are not state variables.  An Equation of State (like\nthe ideal gas equation PV  =  µ RT ) is a relation connecting different state variables.\n\n7. A quasi-static process is an infinitely slow process such that the system remains in\nthermal and mechanical equilibrium with the surroundings throughout. In a\nquasi-static process, the pressure and temperature of the environment can differ from\nthose of the system only infinitesimally.\n\n8. In an isothermal expansion of an ideal gas from volume V\n1\n to V\n\n2\n at temperature T the\n\nheat absorbed (Q) equals the work done (W ) by the gas, each given by\n\nQ  =  W  =   µ R T   ln \uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n\uf8eb\n\n1\n\n2\n\nV\n\nV\n\n9.

Heat engine is a device in which a system undergoes a cyclic process resulting in\n\nconversion of heat into work. If Q\n1\n is the heat absorbed from the source, Q\n\n2\n is the heat\n\nreleased to the sink, and the work output in one cycle is W, the efficiency η of the engine\nis:\n\n   1  2\n\n1 1\n\n QW\n\nQ Q\nη = = −\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS320\n\n11. In a refrigerator or a heat pump, the system extracts heat Q\n2\n from the cold reservoir and\n\nreleases Q\n1\n amount of heat to the hot reservoir, with work W done on the system.

The second law of thermodynamics disallows some processes consistent with the First\nLaw of Thermodynamics. It states\n\nKelvin-Planck statement\n\nNo process is possible whose sole result is the absorption of heat from a reservoir and\ncomplete conversion of the heat into work.\n\nClausius statement\n\nNo process is possible whose sole result is the transfer of heat from a colder object to a\nhotter object.\n\nPut simply, the Second Law implies that no heat engine can have efficiency η equal to\n1 or no refrigerator can have co-efficient of performance α equal to infinity.\n\n13. A process is reversible if it can be reversed such that both the system and the surroundings\nreturn to their original states, with no other change anywhere else in the universe.\nSpontaneous processes of nature are irreversible. The idealised reversible process is a\nquasi-static process with no dissipative factors such as friction, viscosity, etc.\n\n14. Carnot engine is a reversible engine operating between two temperatures T\n1\n (source) and\n\nT\n2\n (sink).

Temperature of a body is related to its average internal energy, not to the kinetic energy\nof motion of its centre of mass. A bullet fired from a gun is not at a higher temperature\nbecause of its high speed.\n\n2. Equilibrium in thermodynamics refers to the situation when macroscopic variables\ndescribing the thermodynamic state of a system do not depend on time.  Equilibrium of\na system in mechanics means the net external force and torque on the system are zero.\n\n3. In a state of thermodynamic equilibrium, the microscopic constituents of a system are\nnot in equilibrium (in the sense of mechanics).\n\n4. Heat capacity, in general, depends on the process the system goes through when heat is\nsupplied.\n\n5. In isothermal quasi-static processes, heat is absorbed or given out by the system even\nthough at every stage the gas has the same temperature as that of the surrounding\nreservoir.  This is possible because of the infinitesimal difference in temperature between\n\nthe system and the reservoir.\n\nEXERCISES\n\n12.1 A geyser heats water flowing at the rate of 3.0 litres per minute from 27 °C to 77 °C.\nIf the geyser operates on a gas burner, what is the rate of consumption of the fuel if\nits heat of combustion is 4.0 × 10\n\n4\n J/g ?\n\n12.2 What amount of heat must be supplied to 2.0 × 10\n–2\n\n kg of nitrogen (at room\ntemperature) to raise its temperature by 45 °C at constant pressure ?

Boyle,\nNewton and several others tried to explain the behaviour of\ngases by considering that gases are made up of tiny atomic\nparticles. The actual atomic theory got established more than\n150 years later. Kinetic theory explains the behaviour of gases\nbased on the idea that the gas  consists of rapidly moving\natoms or molecules. This is possible as the inter-atomic forces,\nwhich are short range forces that are important for solids\nand liquids,  can be neglected for gases. The kinetic theory\nwas developed in the nineteenth century by Maxwell,\nBoltzmann and others. It has been remarkably successful. It\ngives a molecular interpretation of  pressure and temperature\nof a gas, and is consistent with gas laws and Avogadro’s\nhypothesis. It correctly explains specific heat capacities of\nmany gases. It also relates measurable properties of gases\nsuch as viscosity, conduction and diffusion with molecular\nparameters, yielding estimates of molecular sizes and masses.\nThis chapter gives an introduction to kinetic theory.\n\n13.2 MOLECULAR NATURE OF MATTER\n\nRichard Feynman, one of the great physicists of 20th century\nconsiders the discovery that “Matter is made up of atoms” to\nbe a very significant one. Humanity may suffer annihilation\n(due to nuclear catastrophe) or extinction (due to\nenvironmental disasters) if we do not act wisely. If that\nhappens, and all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed\nthen Feynman would like the ‘Atomic Hypothesis’ to be\ncommunicated to the next generation of creatures in the\nuniverse. Atomic Hypothesis: All things are made of atoms -\nlittle particles that move around in perpetual motion,\nattracting each other when they are a little distance apart,\nbut repelling upon being squeezed into one another.\n\nSpeculation that matter may not be continuous, existed in\nmany places and cultures.

The scientific ‘Atomic\nTheory’  is usually credited to John Dalton. He\nproposed the atomic  theory to explain the laws\nof definite and multiple proportions obeyed by\nelements when they combine into compounds.\nThe first law says that any given compound has,\na fixed proportion by mass of its constituents.\nThe second law says that when two elements\nform more than one compound, for a fixed mass\nof one element, the masses of the other elements\nare in ratio of small integers.\n\nTo explain the laws Dalton suggested, about\n200 years ago,  that the smallest constituents\nof an element are atoms. Atoms of one element\nare identical but differ from those of other\nelements.  A small number of atoms of each\nelement combine to form a molecule of the\ncompound. Gay Lussac’s law, also given in early\n19th century, states:  When gases combine\nchemically to yield another gas, their volumes\nare in the ratios of small integers.  Avogadro’s\nlaw  (or hypothesis) says: Equal volumes of all\ngases at equal temperature and pressure have\nthe same number of molecules.  Avogadro’s law,\nwhen combined with Dalton’s theory explains\nGay  Lussac’s law.  Since the elements are often\nin the form of molecules, Dalton’s atomic theory\ncan also be referred to as the molecular theory\n\nof matter. The theory is now well accepted by\nscientists. However even at the end of the\nnineteenth century there were famous scientists\nwho did not believe in atomic theory !\n\nFrom many observations, in recent times we\nnow know that  molecules (made up of one or\nmore atoms) constitute matter. Electron\nmicroscopes  and scanning tunnelling\nmicroscopes enable us to even see them. The\nsize of an atom is about an angstrom (10 -10   m).\nIn solids, which are tightly packed, atoms are\nspaced about a few  angstroms (2 Å) apart. In\nliquids the separation between atoms is also\nabout the same.  In liquids the atoms  are not\nas rigidly fixed as in solids, and can move\naround. This enables a liquid to flow.  In gases\nthe interatomic distances are in tens of\nangstroms.  The average distance a molecule\ncan travel without colliding is called the  mean\nfree path. The mean free path, in gases, is of\nthe order of thousands of angstroms. The atoms\nare much freer in gases and can travel long\ndistances without colliding. If they are not\nenclosed, gases disperse away. In solids and\nliquids the closeness makes the interatomic force\nimportant. The force has a long range attraction\nand a short range repulsion. The atoms attract\nwhen they are at a few angstroms but repel when\nthey come closer. The static appearance of a gas\n\nAtomic Hypothesis in Ancient India and Greece\n\nThough John Dalton is credited with the introduction of atomic viewpoint in modern science, scholars in\nancient India and Greece conjectured long before the existence of atoms and molecules.  In the Vaiseshika\nschool of thought in India founded by Kanada (Sixth century B.C.) the atomic picture was developed in\nconsiderable detail. Atoms were thought to be eternal, indivisible, infinitesimal and ultimate parts of matter.\nIt was argued that if matter could be subdivided without an end, there would be no difference between a\nmustard seed and the Meru mountain.  The four kinds of atoms (Paramanu — Sanskrit word for the\nsmallest particle) postulated were Bhoomi (Earth), Ap (water), Tejas (fire) and Vayu (air) that have characteristic\nmass and other attributes, were propounded. Akasa (space) was thought to have no atomic structure and\nwas continuous and inert. Atoms combine to form different molecules (e.g. two atoms combine to form a\ndiatomic molecule dvyanuka, three atoms form a tryanuka or a triatomic molecule), their properties depending\nupon the nature and ratio of the constituent atoms.  The size of the atoms was also estimated, by conjecture\nor by methods that are not known to us.  The estimates vary. In Lalitavistara, a famous biography of the\nBuddha written mainly in the second century B.C., the estimate is close to the modern estimate of atomic\nsize, of the order of 10 –10 m.\n   In ancient Greece, Democritus (Fourth century B.C.) is best known for his atomic hypothesis. The\nword ‘atom’ means ‘indivisible’ in Greek. According to him, atoms differ from each other physically, in\nshape, size and other properties and this resulted in the different properties of the substances formed\nby their combination.  The atoms of water were smooth and round and unable to ‘hook’ on to each\nother, which is why liquid /water flows easily.   The atoms of earth were rough and jagged, so they held\ntogether to form hard substances.  The atoms of fire were thorny which is why it caused painful burns.\nThese fascinating ideas, despite their ingenuity, could not evolve much further, perhaps because they\nwere intuitive conjectures and speculations not tested and modified by quantitative experiments - the\nhallmark of modern science.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nKINETIC THEORY 325\n\nis misleading. The gas is full of activity and the\nequilibrium is a dynamic one. In dynamic\nequilibrium, molecules collide and change their\nspeeds during the collision. Only the average\nproperties are constant.\n\nAtomic theory is not the end of our quest, but\nthe beginning. We now know that atoms are not\nindivisible or elementary. They consist of a\nnucleus and electrons. The nucleus itself is made\nup of protons and neutrons. The protons and\nneutrons are again made up of quarks. Even\nquarks may not be the end of the story. There\nmay be string like elementary entities. Nature\nalways has surprises for us, but the search for\ntruth is often enjoyable and the discoveries\nbeautiful. In this chapter, we shall limit ourselves\nto understanding the behaviour of gases (and a\nlittle bit of solids), as a collection of moving\nmolecules in incessant motion.\n\n13.3   BEHAVIOUR OF GASES\n\nProperties of gases are easier to understand than\nthose of solids and liquids. This is mainly\nbecause in a gas, molecules are far from each\nother and their mutual interactions are\nnegligible except when two molecules collide.\nGases at low pressures and high temperatures\nmuch above that at which they liquefy (or\nsolidify) approximately satisfy a simple relation\nbetween their pressure, temperature and volume\ngiven by (see Chapter 11)\n\nPV = KT (13.1)\n\nfor a given sample of the gas. Here T is the\ntemperature in kelvin or (absolute)  scale. K is  a\nconstant for the given sample but varies with\nthe volume of the gas. If we now  bring in  the\nidea of atoms or molecules, then K is proportional\nto the number of molecules, (say) N in the\nsample. We can write K = N k . Observation tells\nus that this k is same for all gases. It is called\nBoltzmann constant and is denoted by k\n\nB\n.\n\nAs 1 1 2 2\n1 1 2 2\n\nP V P V\n\nN T N T\n=  = constant = k\n\nB\n(13.2)\n\nif P, V and T are same, then N is also same for\nall gases. This is Avogadro’s hypothesis, that  the\nnumber of molecules per unit volume is\nthe same for all gases at a fixed temperature and\npressure. The number in 22.4 litres of any gas\nis 6.02 × 1023.  This is known as Avogadro\nnumber  and is denoted by N\n\nA\n. The mass of 22.4\n\nlitres of any gas is equal to its molecular weight\nin grams at S.T.P (standard temperature 273 K\nand pressure 1 atm). This amount of substance\nis called a mole (see Chapter 2 for a more precise\ndefinition). Avogadro had guessed the equality of\nnumbers in equal volumes of gas at a fixed\ntemperature and pressure from chemical\nreactions.  Kinetic  theory justifies this hypothesis.\n\nThe perfect gas equation can be written as\n\nPV = µ RT (13.3)\nwhere  µ   is the number of moles and R  = N\n\nA\nk\n\nB\n is a universal constant. The temperature T is\n\nabsolute temperature.  Choosing kelvin scale for\n\nJohn Dalton (1766 – 1844)\n\nHe was an English chemist. When different types of atoms combine,\nthey obey certain simple laws. Dalton’s atomic theory explains these\nlaws in a simple way. He also gave a theory of colour\nblindness.\n\nAmedeo Avogadro (1776 – 1856)\n\nHe made a brilliant guess that equal volumes of gases\nhave equal number of molecules at the same\ntemperature and pressure. This helped in\nunderstanding the combination of different gases in\n\na very simple way. It is now called Avogadro’s hypothesis (or law). He also\nsuggested that the smallest constituent of gases like hydrogen, oxygen and\nnitrogen are not atoms but diatomic molecules.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n326 PHYSICS\n\nabsolute temperature, R = 8.314 J mol–1K–1.\nHere\n\n0 A\n\nM N\n\nM N\nµ = = (13.4)\n\nwhere M is the mass of the gas containing N\nmolecules, M\n\n0\n is the molar mass and N\n\nA\n the\n\nAvogadro’s number.

(13.4) and (13.3)\ncan also be written as\n\nPV = k\nB\n NT or P = k\n\nB\n nT\n\nP (atm)\nFig.13.1 Real gases approach ideal gas behaviour\n\nat low pressures and high temperatures.\n\nwhere  n is the number density, i.e. number of\nmolecules per unit volume. k\n\nB\n is  the Boltzmann\n\nconstant introduced above. Its value in SI units\nis 1.38 × 10–23 J K–1.\n\nAnother useful form of Eq. (13.3) is\n\n0\n\nRT\nP\n\nM\n\nρ\n= (13.5)\n\nwhere ρ is the mass density of the gas.\nA gas that satisfies Eq. (13.3) exactly at all\n\npressures and temperatures is defined to be an\nideal gas. An ideal gas is a simple theoretical\nmodel of a gas. No real gas is truly ideal.\nFig. 13.1 shows departures from ideal gas\nbehaviour for a real gas at three different\ntemperatures. Notice that all curves approach\nthe ideal gas behaviour for low  pressures and\nhigh temperatures.\n\nAt low pressures or high temperatures the\nmolecules are far apart and molecular\ninteractions are negligible. Without interactions\nthe gas behaves like an ideal one.\n\nIf we fix µ and T in Eq. (13.3), we get\n\nPV = constant (13.6)\n\ni.e., keeping temperature constant, pressure of\na given mass of gas varies inversely with volume.\nThis is the famous Boyle’s law. Fig. 13.2  shows\ncomparison between experimental P-V curves\nand the theoretical curves predicted by Boyle’s\nlaw. Once again you see that the  agreement is\ngood at high temperatures and  low pressures.\nNext, if you fix P, Eq. (13.1) shows that V ∝  T\ni.e., for a fixed pressure, the volume of a gas is\nproportional to its absolute temperature T\n(Charles’ law). See Fig. 13.3.\n\nFig.13.2 Experimental P-V curves (solid lines) for\nsteam at three temperatures compared\n\nwith Boyle’s law (dotted lines). P is in units\n\nof 22 atm and V in units of 0.09 litres.\n\nFinally, consider a mixture of non-interacting\nideal  gases: µ\n\n1\n  moles of gas 1, µ\n\n2\n moles of gas\n\n2, etc. in a vessel of volume V at temperature T\nand  pressure P. It is then found that the\nequation  of state of the mixture is :\n\nPV = ( µ\n1\n + µ\n\n2 \n+…  ) RT (13.7)\n\ni.e. 1 2 ...\nRT RT\n\nP\nV V\n\nµ µ= + + (13.8)\n\n= P\n1\n + P\n\n2\n + … (13.9)\n\nClearly P\n1\n =    µ\n\n1\n R T/V   is the pressure that\n\ngas 1 would  exert at the same conditions of\nvolume and  temperature if no other gases were\npresent. This is called the partial pressure of the\ngas. Thus, the total pressure of a mixture of ideal\ngases is the sum of partial pressures. This is\nDalton’s law of partial pressures.\n\n(\n)\n\n–1\n–1\n\nJ\nm\n\no\nl\n\nK\np\nV Tµ\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nKINETIC THEORY 327\n\nt\n\nt\n\nt\n\nFig. 13.3 Experimental T-V curves (solid lines) for\nCO\n\n2\n at three pressures compared with\n\nCharles’ law (dotted lines). T is in units of\n\n300 K and V in units of 0.13 litres.\n\nWe next consider some examples which give\nus information about the volume occupied by\nthe molecules and the volume of a single\nmolecule.\n\nExample 13.1 The density of water is  1000\nkg m–3. The density of water vapour at 100 °C\nand 1 atm pressure is 0.6 kg m–3. The\nvolume of a molecule multiplied by the total\nnumber gives ,what is called, molecular\nvolume. Estimate the ratio (or fraction) of\nthe molecular volume  to the total volume\noccupied by the water vapour under the\nabove conditions of temperature and\npressure.\n\nAnswer For  a given mass of water molecules,\nthe density is less if volume is large. So the\nvolume of the vapour is  1000/0.6  = 1/(6 ×10 -4 )\ntimes larger.  If densities of bulk water and water\nmolecules are same, then the fraction of\nmolecular volume to the total volume in liquid\nstate is 1. As volume in vapour state has\nincreased, the fractional volume is less by the\nsame amount, i.e.  6×10-4.       t\n\nExample 13.2   Estimate the volume of a\nwater molecule using the data in Example\n13.1.\n\nAnswer In the liquid (or solid) phase, the\nmolecules of water are quite closely packed. The\n\ndensity of water molecule may therefore, be\nregarded as roughly equal to the density of bulk\nwater = 1000 kg m–3. To estimate the volume of\na water molecule, we need to know the mass of\na single water molecule. We know that 1 mole\nof water has a mass approximately equal to\n\n(2 + 16)g  = 18 g  =  0.018 kg.\nSince 1 mole   contains  about   6 × 1023\n\nmolecules   (Avogadro’s  number),   the mass of\na molecule of water is  (0.018)/(6 × 1023) kg  =\n3 × 10–26 kg.   Therefore, a rough estimate of the\nvolume of a water  molecule is as follows :\n\nVolume of a water molecule\n= (3 × 10–26 kg)/ (1000 kg m–3)\n= 3 × 10–29 m3\n\n= (4/3) π  (Radius)3\nHence, Radius ≈ 2 ×10-10  m = 2 Å   t\n\nExample 13.3   What is the average\ndistance between atoms   (interatomic\ndistance) in water? Use the data given in\nExamples 13.1 and 13.2.\n\nAnswer :   A given mass of water in vapour state\nhas 1.67×103 times the volume of the same mass\nof water in liquid state (Ex. 13.1). This is also\nthe increase in the amount of volume available\nfor each molecule of water. When volume\nincreases by 103 times the radius increases by\nV1/3 or 10 times, i.e., 10 × 2 Å  = 20 Å. So the\naverage distance is 2 × 20 = 40  Å.   t\n\nExample 13.4 A vessel contains two non-\nreactive gases : neon (monatomic) and\noxygen (diatomic). The ratio of their partial\npressures is 3:2. Estimate the ratio of  (i)\nnumber of molecules and (ii) mass density\nof neon and oxygen in the vessel. Atomic\nmass of Ne = 20.2 u, molecular mass of O\n\n2\n= 32.0 u.\n\nAnswer Partial pressure of a gas in a mixture is\nthe pressure it would have for the same volume\nand temperature if it alone occupied the vessel.\n(The total pressure of a mixture of non-reactive\ngases is the sum of partial pressures due to its\nconstituent gases.) Each gas (assumed ideal)\nobeys the gas law. Since V and T are common to\nthe two gases,  we  have  P\n\n1\nV = µ \n\n1\n RT and P\n\n2\nV =\n\nµ\n2\n RT, i.e. (P\n\n1\n/P\n\n2\n) = (µ\n\n1 \n/ µ\n\n2\n). Here 1 and 2 refer\n\nto neon and oxygen respectively. Since (P\n1\n/P\n\n2\n) =\n\n(3/2) (given), (µ\n1\n/ µ\n\n2\n) = 3/2.\n\nt\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n328 PHYSICS\n\n(i) By definition µ\n1\n = (N\n\n1\n/N\n\nA\n ) and µ\n\n2 \n= (N\n\n2\n/N\n\nA\n)\n\nwhere N\n1\n and N\n\n2\n are the number of molecules\n\nof 1 and 2, and N\nA\n is the Avogadro’s number.\n\nTherefore, (N\n1\n/N\n\n2\n) = (µ\n\n1 \n/ µ\n\n2\n)  = 3/2.\n\n(ii) We can also write µ\n1\n = (m\n\n1\n/M\n\n1\n) and µ\n\n2\n =\n\n(m\n2\n/M\n\n2\n) where m\n\n1 \nand m\n\n2\n are the masses of\n\n1 and 2; and M\n1\n and M\n\n2\n are their molecular\n\nmasses.

A given amount of gas is a\ncollection of a large number of molecules\n(typically of the order of Avogadro’s number) that\nare in incessant random motion. At ordinary\npressure and temperature, the average distance\nbetween molecules is a factor of 10 or more than\nthe typical size of a molecule (2 Å). Thus,\ninteraction between molecules is negligible and\nwe can assume that they move freely in straight\nlines according to Newton’s first law. However,\noccasionally, they come close to each other,\nexperience intermolecular forces and their\nvelocities change.  These interactions are called\ncollisions. The molecules collide incessantly\nagainst each other or with the walls and change\ntheir velocities.  The collisions are considered to\nbe elastic. We can derive an expression for the\npressure of a gas based on the kinetic theory.\n\nWe begin with the idea that molecules of a\ngas are in incessant random motion, colliding\nagainst one another and with the walls of the\ncontainer. All collisions between molecules\namong themselves or between molecules and the\nwalls are elastic. This implies that  total kinetic\nenergy is conserved. The total momentum is\nconserved as usual.\n\n13.4.1 Pressure of an Ideal Gas\n\nConsider a gas enclosed in a cube of side l. Take\nthe axes to be parallel to the sides of the cube,\nas shown in Fig. 13.4.  A molecule with velocity\n\n(v\nx\n, v\n\ny\n, v\n\nz\n ) hits the planar wall parallel to yz-\n\nplane of area A (= l2). Since the collision is elastic,\nthe molecule rebounds with the same velocity;\nits y and z components of velocity do not change\nin the collision but the x-component reverses\nsign. That is, the velocity after collision is\n(-v\n\nx\n, v\n\ny\n, v\n\nz\n ) . The change in momentum of the\n\nmolecule is:  –mv\nx\n – (mv\n\nx\n) = – 2mv\n\nx \n. By the\n\nprinciple of conservation of momentum, the\nmomentum imparted to the wall in the collision\n= 2mv\n\nx\n .\n\nTo calculate the force (and pressure) on the\nwall, we need to calculate momentum imparted\nto the wall per unit time. In a small time interval\n∆t, a molecule with x-component of velocity v\n\nx\n\nwill hit the wall if it is within the distance v\nx\n ∆t\n\nfrom the wall. That is, all molecules within the\nvolume Av\n\nx \n∆t only can hit the wall in time ∆t.\n\nBut, on the average, half of these are moving\ntowards the wall and the other half away from\nthe wall. Thus, the number of molecules with\nvelocity (v\n\nx\n, v\n\ny\n, v\n\nz\n )  hitting the wall in time ∆t is\n\n½A v\nx  \n\n∆t n, where n is the number of molecules\nper unit volume. The total momentum\ntransferred to the wall by these molecules in\ntime ∆t  is :\n\nQ = (2mv\nx\n) (½ n A v\n\nx\n ∆t ) (13.10)\n\nThe force on the wall is the rate of momentum\ntransfer Q/∆t  and pressure is force per unit\narea :\n\nP =  Q /(A ∆t)  =  n m v\nx\n2 (3.11)\n\nActually, all molecules in a gas do not have\nthe same velocity; there is a distribution in\nvelocities.  The  above equation, therefore, stands\nfor pressure due to the group of molecules with\nspeed v\n\nx\n  in  the x-direction and n stands for the\n\nnumber density of that group of molecules. The\n\nFig. 13.4 Elastic collision of a gas molecule with\nthe wall of the container.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nKINETIC THEORY 329\n\ntotal  pressure is obtained by summing over the\ncontribution due to all groups:\n\nP = n m 2\nxv (13.12)\n\nwhere 2\nxv  is the average of  vx\n\n2  .  Now the gas\nis isotropic, i.e. there is no preferred direction\nof velocity of the molecules in the vessel.\nTherefore, by symmetry,\n\n2\nx\n\nv  = \n2\nyv  = \n\n2\nz\n\nv\n\n= (1/3) [ 2\nxv  +  \n\n2\nyv  + \n\n2\nzv ] = (1/3) \n\n2\nv (13.13)\n\nwhere v is the speed and 2v   denotes the mean\n\nof the squared speed. Thus\n\nP = (1/3) n m 2v (13.14)\n\nSome remarks on this derivation. First,\nthough we choose the container to be a cube,\nthe shape of the vessel really is immaterial. For\na vessel of arbitrary shape, we can always choose\na small infinitesimal (planar) area and carry\nthrough the steps above. Notice that both A and\n∆t do not appear in the final result. By Pascal’s\nlaw, given in Ch. 10,  pressure in one portion of\n\nthe gas  in equilibrium is the same as anywhere\nelse. Second, we have ignored any collisions in\nthe derivation. Though this assumption is\ndifficult to justify rigorously, we can qualitatively\nsee that it will not lead to erroneous results.\nThe number of molecules hitting the wall in time\n∆t was found to be ½ n Av\n\nx\n ∆t. Now the collisions\n\nare random and the gas is in a steady state.\nThus, if a molecule with velocity (v\n\nx\n, v\n\ny\n, v\n\nz\n )\n\nacquires a  different velocity due to collision with\nsome molecule, there will always be some other\nmolecule with a different initial velocity which\nafter a collision acquires the velocity  (v\n\nx\n, v\n\ny\n, v\n\nz\n ).\n\nIf this were not so, the distribution of velocities\nwould not remain steady. In any case we are\nfinding 2\n\nxv . Thus, on the whole, molecular\ncollisions (if they are not too frequent and the\ntime spent in a collision is negligible compared\nto time between collisions)  will not affect the\ncalculation above.\n\n13.4.2 Kinetic Interpretation of Temperature\n\nEquation (13.14) can be written as\nPV   =  (1/3) nV m 2v (13.15a)\n\nFounders of Kinetic Theory of Gases\n\nJames Clerk Maxwell (1831 – 1879), born in Edinburgh,\nScotland, was among the greatest physicists of the nineteenth\ncentury.  He derived the thermal velocity distribution of molecules\nin a gas and was among the first to obtain reliable estimates of\nmolecular parameters from measurable quantities like viscosity,\netc.  Maxwell’s greatest achievement was the unification of the laws\nof electricity and magnetism (discovered by Coulomb, Oersted,\nAmpere and Faraday) into a consistent set of equations now called\nMaxwell’s equations. From these he arrived at the most important\nconclusion that light is an\nelectromagnetic wave.\nInterestingly, Maxwell did not\nagree with the idea (strongly\nsuggested by the Faraday’s\nlaws of electrolysis) that\nelectricity was particulate in\nnature.\n\nLudwig Boltzmann\n(1844 – 1906) born in\n\nVienna, Austria, worked on the kinetic theory of gases\nindependently of Maxwell.  A firm advocate of atomism, that is\nbasic to kinetic theory, Boltzmann provided a statistical\ninterpretation of the Second Law of thermodynamics and the\nconcept of entropy. He is regarded as one of the founders of classical\nstatistical mechanics. The proportionality constant connecting\nenergy and temperature in kinetic theory is known as Boltzmann’s\nconstant in his honour.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n330 PHYSICS\n\nt\n\nPV   =   (2/3) N x ½ m 2v (13.15b)\nwhere N (= nV ) is the number of molecules in\nthe sample.\n\nThe quantity in the bracket is the average\ntranslational kinetic energy of the molecules in\nthe gas. Since the internal energy E of an ideal\ngas is purely kinetic*,\n\nE = N × (1/2) m 2v (13.16)\n\nEquation (13.15) then gives :\nPV = (2/3) E (13.17)\nWe are now ready for a kinetic interpretation\n\nof temperature. Combining Eq. (13.17) with the\nideal gas Eq. (13.3), we get\n\nE = (3/2)  k\nB  \n\nNT                                             (13.18)\nor  E/ N = ½  m 2v    =   (3/2) kBT (13.19)\ni.e., the average kinetic energy of a molecule is\nproportional to the absolute temperature of the\ngas; it is independent of pressure, volume or\nthe nature of the ideal gas. This is a fundamental\nresult relating temperature, a macroscopic\nmeasurable parameter of a gas\n(a thermodynamic variable as it is called) to a\nmolecular quantity, namely the average kinetic\nenergy of a molecule. The two domains are\nconnected by the Boltzmann constant. We note\nin passing that Eq. (13.18) tells us that internal\nenergy of an ideal gas depends only on\ntemperature, not on pressure or volume. With\nthis interpretation of temperature, kinetic theory\nof an ideal gas is completely consistent with the\nideal gas equation and the various gas laws\nbased on it.\n\nFor a mixture of non-reactive ideal gases, the\ntotal pressure gets contribution from each gas\nin the mixture. Equation (13.14) becomes\n\nP = (1/3) [n\n1\nm\n\n1\n2\n1v  + n2 m2 \n\n2\n2v +…  ] (13.20)\n\nIn equilibrium, the average kinetic energy of\nthe molecules of different gases will be equal.\nThat is,\n\n½  m\n1\n 2\n\n1v  = ½ m2 \n2\n2v = (3/2) kB T\n\nso that\nP = (n\n\n1\n + n\n\n2\n +…  ) k\n\nB\n T (13.21)\n\nwhich is Dalton’s law of partial pressures.\nFrom Eq. (13.19), we can get an idea of the\n\ntypical speed of molecules in a gas. At a\ntemperature T = 300 K, the mean square speed\nof a molecule in nitrogen gas is :\n\n2 –26\n26\n\n28\n4.65 10\n\n6.02 10\nN\n\nA\n\nM\nm\n\nN\n= = = ×\n\n×  kg.\n\n2\nv   =  3 kB T / m    =    (516)\n\n2 m2s-2\n\nThe square root of 2v  is known as root mean\nsquare (rms) speed and is denoted by v\n\nrms\n,\n\n( We can also write    2v     as   < v\n2 >.)\n\nv\nrms\n\n   =    516 m s-1\n\nThe speed is of the order of the speed of sound\nin air. It follows from Eq. (13.19) that at the same\ntemperature, lighter molecules have greater rms\nspeed.\n\nExample 13.5 A flask contains argon and\nchlorine in the ratio of 2:1 by mass.  The\ntemperature of the mixture is 27 °C. Obtain\nthe ratio of  (i) average kinetic energy per\nmolecule, and (ii) root mean square speed\nv\n\nrms\n of the molecules of the two gases.\n\nAtomic mass of argon = 39.9 u; Molecular\nmass of chlorine = 70.9 u.\n\nAnswer The important point to remember is that\nthe average kinetic energy (per molecule) of any\n(ideal) gas (be it monatomic like argon, diatomic\nlike chlorine or polyatomic) is always equal to\n(3/2) k\n\nB\nT. It depends only on temperature, and\n\nis independent of the nature of the gas.\n(i) Since argon and chlorine both have the same\n\ntemperature in the flask, the ratio of average\nkinetic energy (per molecule) of the two gases\nis 1:1.\n\n(ii) Now  ½ m v\nrms\n\n2  =  average kinetic energy per\nmolecule =  (3/2) ) k\n\nB\nT where m is the mass\n\nof a molecule of the gas.

Any other proportion by mass of\nargon and chlorine would give the same answers\nto (i) and (ii), provided the temperature remains\nunaltered. t\n\nExample 13.6   Uranium has two isotopes\nof masses 235 and 238 units. If both are\npresent in Uranium hexafluoride gas which\nwould have the  larger average speed ? If\natomic mass of fluorine is 19 units,\nestimate the percentage difference in\nspeeds at any temperature.\n\nAnswer  At a fixed temperature the average\nenergy  = ½ m <v2 > is constant. So  smaller the\n\nmass of the molecule, faster will be the speed.\nThe ratio of speeds is inversely proportional to\nthe square root of the ratio of the masses. The\nmasses are 349 and 352 units. So\n\nv\n349\n\n / v\n352\n\n  =   ( 352/ 349)1/2 = 1.0044 .\n\nHence difference \nV\n\nV\n\n∆\n= 0.44 %.\n\n[235U\n \nis the isotope needed for nuclear fission.\n\nTo separate it from the more abundant isotope\n238U,  the mixture  is surrounded by a  porous\ncylinder. The porous cylinder must be thick and\nnarrow, so that the molecule wanders through\nindividually, colliding with the walls of the long\npore. The faster molecule will leak out more than\n\nMaxwell Distribution Function\n\nIn a given mass of gas, the velocities of all molecules are not the same, even when bulk\nparameters like pressure, volume and temperature are fixed. Collisions change the direction\nand the speed of molecules. However in a state of equilibrium, the distribution of speeds is\nconstant or fixed.\n\nDistributions are very important and useful when dealing with systems containing large\nnumber of  objects. As an example consider the ages of different persons in a city. It is not\nfeasible to deal with the age of each individual. We can divide the people into groups: children\nup to age 20 years, adults between ages of 20 and 60, old people above 60. If we want more\ndetailed information we can choose smaller intervals, 0-1, 1-2,..., 99-100 of age groups. When\nthe size of the interval becomes smaller, say half year, the number of persons in the interval\nwill also reduce, roughly half the original number in the one  year interval. The number of\npersons  dN(x)  in the age interval x and x+dx is proportional to dx or dN(x)  =   n\n\nx\n  dx.  We have\n\nused n\nx\n to denote the number of persons at the value of x.\n\nMaxwell distribution of molecular speeds\n\nIn a similar way the molecular speed distribution gives the number of molecules between\nthe speeds v and v+ dv. dN(v)\n\n \n= 4p N a3e–bv\n\n2 v2 dv = n\nv\ndv.  This is called Maxwell distribution.\n\nThe plot of n\nv \n against v is shown in the figure. The fraction of the molecules with speeds v and\n\nv+dv is equal to the area of the strip shown. The average of any quantity like v2 is defined by\nthe integral <v2> = (1/N ) ∫ v2 dN(v)\n\n   \n= ªªªªª(3kB T/m)    which  agrees with the result derived from\n\nmore elementary considerations.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n332 PHYSICS\n\nt\n\nthe slower one and so there is more of the lighter\nmolecule (enrichment) outside the porous\ncylinder (Fig. 13.5). The method is not very\nefficient and has to be repeated several times\nfor sufficient enrichment.]. t\n\nWhen gases diffuse, their rate of diffusion is\ninversely proportional to square root of the\nmasses (see Exercise 13.12 ). Can you guess the\nexplanation from the above answer?\n\nFig. 13.5  Molecules going through a porous wall.\n\nExample 13.7  (a)  When a molecule (or\nan elastic ball) hits a ( massive) wall, it\nrebounds with the same speed. When a ball\nhits a massive bat held firmly, the same\nthing happens. However, when the bat is\nmoving towards the ball, the ball rebounds\nwith a different speed. Does the ball move\nfaster or slower? (Ch.6 will refresh your\nmemory on elastic collisions.)\n\n(b) When gas in a cylinder is compressed\nby pushing in a piston, its temperature\nrises. Guess at an explanation of this in\nterms of kinetic theory using (a) above.\n\n(c) What happens when a compressed gas\npushes a piston out and expands. What\nwould you observe ?\n(d) Sachin Tendulkar used a heavy cricket\nbat while playing. Did it help him in\nanyway ?\n\nAnswer  (a)  Let the speed of the ball be u  relative\nto the wicket behind the bat. If the bat is moving\ntowards the ball with a speed V  relative to the\nwicket, then the relative speed of the ball to bat\n\nis V + u  towards the bat. When the ball rebounds\n(after hitting the massive bat) its speed,  relative\nto bat,  is V + u  moving away from the bat. So\nrelative to the wicket the speed of the rebounding\nball is V + (V + u) = 2V + u, moving away from\nthe wicket. So the ball speeds up after the\ncollision with the bat. The rebound speed will\nbe less than u if the bat is not massive. For a\nmolecule this would imply an increase in\ntemperature.\n\nYou  should be able to answer (b) (c) and (d)\nbased on the answer to (a).\n(Hint: Note the correspondence, pistonà bat,\n\ncylinder à wicket, molecule à ball.)         t\n\n13.5  LAW OF EQUIPARTITION OF ENERGY\n\nThe kinetic energy of a single molecule is\n\n2 2 21 1 1      \n2 2 2t x y z\n\nmv mv mvε = + + (13.22)\n\nFor a gas in thermal equilibrium at\ntemperature T  the average value of energy\n\ndenoted by   < tε > is\n\n2 2 21 1 1 3\n2 2 2 2\n\nt x y z Bmv mv mv k Tε = + + = (13.23)\n\nSince there is no preferred direction, Eq.

If it is\nconstrained to move in a plane it needs two; and\nif constrained to move along a line, it needs just\none coordinate to locate it. This can also be\nexpressed in another way. We say that it has\none degree of freedom for motion in a line, two\nfor motion in a plane and three for motion in\nspace. Motion of a body as a whole from one\npoint to another is called translation. Thus, a\nmolecule free to move in space has three\ntranslational degrees of freedom. Each\ntranslational degree of freedom contributes a\nterm that contains square of some variable of\nmotion, e.g., ½ mv\n\nx\n2  and similar terms in\n\nv\ny\n and v\n\nz\n. In, Eq. (13.24) we see that in thermal\n\nequilibrium, the average of each such term is\n½ k\n\nB\nT .\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nKINETIC THEORY 333\n\nMolecules of a monatomic gas like argon have\nonly translational degrees of freedom. But what\nabout a diatomic gas such as O\n\n2\n or N\n\n2\n? A\n\nmolecule of O\n2 \nhas three translational degrees\n\nof freedom. But in addition it can also rotate\nabout its centre of mass. Figure 13.6 shows the\ntwo independent axes of rotation 1 and 2, normal\nto the axis joining the two oxygen atoms about\nwhich the molecule can rotate*. The molecule\nthus has two rotational degrees of freedom, each\nof which contributes a term to the total energy\nconsisting of translational energy tε  and\nrotational energy ε\n\nr\n.\n\n2 2 2 2 2\n1 1 2 2\n\n1 1 1 1 1\n2 2 2 2 2t r x y z\n\nmv mv mv I Iε ε ω ω+ = + + + + (13.25)\n\nFig. 13.6 The two independent axes of rotation of a\n\ndiatomic molecule\n\nwhere ω\n1 \nand ω\n\n2 \n are the angular speeds about\n\nthe axes 1 and 2 and I\n1\n, I\n\n2 \nare the corresponding\n\nmoments of inertia. Note that each rotational\ndegree of freedom contributes a term to the\nenergy that contains square of a rotational\nvariable of motion.\n\nWe have assumed above that the O\n2\n molecule\n\nis a ‘rigid rotator’, i.e., the molecule does not\nvibrate. This assumption, though found to be\ntrue (at moderate temperatures) for O\n\n2\n, is not\n\nalways valid. Molecules, like CO, even at\nmoderate temperatures have a mode of vibration,\ni.e., its atoms oscillate along the interatomic axis\nlike a one-dimensional oscillator, and contribute\na vibrational energy term ε\n\nv\n to the total energy:\n\nεv m\ny\n\nt\nky=\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n+\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n2\n2d\n\nd\n\nt r vε ε ε= + + ε (13.26)\nwhere k is the force constant of the oscillator\nand y the vibrational co-ordinate.\n\nOnce again the vibrational energy terms in\nEq. (13.26) contain squared terms of vibrational\nvariables of motion y and dy/dt .\n\nAt this point, notice an important feature in\nEq.(13.26). While each translational and\nrotational degree of freedom has contributed only\none ‘squared term’ in Eq.(13.26), one vibrational\nmode contributes two ‘squared terms’ : kinetic\nand potential energies.\n\nEach quadratic term occurring in the\nexpression for energy is a mode of absorption of\nenergy by the molecule. We have seen that in\nthermal equilibrium at absolute temperature T,\nfor each translational mode of motion, the\naverage energy is ½ k\n\nB\nT. The most elegant\n\nprinciple of classical statistical mechanics (first\nproved by Maxwell) states that this is so for each\nmode of energy: translational, rotational and\nvibrational. That is, in equilibrium, the total\nenergy is equally distributed in all possible\nenergy modes, with each mode having an average\nenergy equal to  ½ k\n\nB\nT. This is known as the law\n\nof equipartition of energy. Accordingly, each\ntranslational and rotational degree of freedom\nof a molecule contributes ½ k\n\nB\nT  to the energy,\n\nwhile each vibrational frequency contributes\n2 × ½ k\n\nB\nT  = k\n\nB\nT ,  since a vibrational mode has\n\nboth kinetic and potential energy modes.\nThe proof of the law of equipartition of energy\n\nis beyond the scope of this book. Here, we shall\napply the law to predict the specific heats of\ngases theoretically. Later, we shall also discuss\nbriefly, the application to specific heat  of solids.\n\n13.6  SPECIFIC HEAT CAPACITY\n\n13.6.1 Monatomic Gases\n\nThe molecule of a monatomic gas has only three\ntranslational degrees of freedom.

The values are\nin good agreement with experimental values of\nspecific heats of several gases given in Table 13.2.\nOf course, there are discrepancies between\npredicted and actual values of specific heats of\nseveral other gases (not shown in the table), such\nas Cl\n\n2\n, C\n\n2\nH\n\n6\n and many other polyatomic gases.\n\nUsually, the experimental values for specific\nheats of these gases are greater than the\npredicted values as given in Table13.1 suggesting\nthat the agreement can be improved by including\nvibrational modes of motion in the calculation.\nThe  law of equipartition of energy is, thus, well\n\nNature of\nGas\n\nC\nv\n\n(J mol\n-1\n\nK\n-1\n\n)\n\nC\np\n\n(J mol\n-1\n\nK\n-1\n\n)\n\nC\np\n- C\n\nv\n\n(J mol\n-1\n\nK\n-1\n\n)\n\ng\n\nMonatomic 12.5 20.8 8.31 1.67\n\nDiatomic 20.8 29.1 8.31 1.40\n\nTriatomic 24.93 33.24 8.31 1.33\n\nTable 13.1 Predicted values of specific heat\ncapacities of gases (ignoring\n\nvibrational modes)\n\nTable13.2 Measured values of specific heat\ncapacities of some gases\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nKINETIC THEORY 335\n\nt\n\nverified experimentally at ordinary\ntemperatures.\n\nExample 13.8 A cylinder of fixed capacity\n44.8 litres contains helium gas at standard\ntemperature and pressure. What is the\namount of heat needed to raise the\ntemperature of the gas in the cylinder by\n15.0 °C ? (R = 8.31 J mo1–1 K–1).\n\nAnswer Using the gas law PV = µRT, you can\neasily show that 1 mol of any (ideal) gas at\nstandard temperature (273 K) and pressure\n(1 atm = 1.01 × 105 Pa) occupies a volume of\n22.4 litres. This universal volume is called molar\nvolume. Thus the cylinder in this example\ncontains 2 mol of helium. Further, since helium\nis monatomic, its predicted (and observed) molar\nspecific heat at constant volume, C\n\nv\n = (3/2) R,\n\nand molar specific heat at constant pressure,\nC\n\np\n = (3/2) R + R = (5/2) R .  Since the volume of\n\nthe cylinder is fixed, the heat required is\ndetermined by C\n\nv\n. Therefore,\n\nHeat required = no. of moles × molar specific\nheat × rise in temperature\n\n= 2 × 1.5 R × 15.0 = 45 R\n= 45 × 8.31 = 374 J. t\n\n13.6.4   Specific Heat Capacity of Solids\n\nWe can use the law of equipartition of energy to\ndetermine specific heats of solids. Consider a\nsolid of N atoms, each vibrating about its mean\nposition. An oscillation in one dimension has\naverage energy of   2 × ½ k\n\nB\nT = k\n\nB\nT . In three\n\ndimensions, the average energy is 3 k\nB\nT. For a\n\nmole of solid, N = N\nA\n, and the total\n\nenergy is\nU =  3  k\n\nB\nT  × N\n\nA\n  = 3 RT\n\nNow at constant pressure ∆Q = ∆U + P∆V\n= ∆U,  since for a solid  ∆V is negligible. Hence,\n\n 3\nQ U\n\nC R\nT T\n\n∆ ∆\n= = =\n\n∆ ∆\n(13.37)\n\nTable 13.3 Specific Heat Capacity of some\nsolids at room temperature and\n\natmospheric pressure\n\nAs Table 13.3 shows the prediction generally\nagrees with experimental values at ordinary\ntemperature (Carbon is an exception).\n\n13.6.5  Specific Heat Capacity of Water\n\nWe treat water like a solid. For each atom average\nenergy is 3k\n\nB\nT. Water molecule has three atoms,\n\ntwo hydrogen and one oxygen. So it has\n\nU = 3 × 3 k\nB\nT  × N\n\nA\n  = 9 RT\n\nand C = ∆Q/ ∆T =∆ U / ∆T  = 9R .\nThis is the value observed and the agreement\n\nis very good. In the calorie, gram, degree units,\nwater is defined to have unit specific heat. As  1\ncalorie = 4.179 joules and one mole of water\nis 18 grams, the heat capacity per mole is\n~ 75 J mol-1 K-1 ~  9R. However with more\ncomplex  molecules like alcohol or acetone the\narguments, based on degrees of freedom, become\nmore complicated.\n\nLastly, we should note an important aspect\nof the predictions of specific heats, based on the\nclassical law of equipartition of energy. The\npredicted specific heats are independent of\ntemperature. As we go to low temperatures,\nhowever, there is a marked departure from this\nprediction. Specific heats of all substances\napproach zero as T à0.  This is related to the\nfact that degrees of freedom get frozen and\nineffective at low temperatures. According to\nclassical physics, degrees of freedom must\nremain unchanged at all times. The behaviour\nof  specific heats at low temperatures shows the\ninadequacy of classical physics and can be\nexplained only by invoking quantum\nconsiderations, as was first shown by Einstein.\nQuantum mechanics requires a minimum,\nnon-zero amount of energy before a degree of\nfreedom comes into play. This is also the reason\nwhy vibrational degrees of freedom come into play\nonly in some cases.\n\n13.7  MEAN FREE PATH\n\nMolecules in a gas have rather large speeds of\nthe order of the speed of sound. Yet a gas leaking\nfrom a cylinder in a kitchen takes considerable\ntime to diffuse to the other corners of the room.\nThe top of a cloud of smoke holds together for\nhours. This happens because molecules in a gas\nhave a finite though small size, so they are bound\nto undergo collisions. As a result, they cannot\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n336 PHYSICS\n\nt\n\nd\n\nd\n\nv\n\nmove straight unhindered; their paths keep\ngetting incessantly deflected.\n\nFig. 13.7 The volume swept by a molecule in time ∆t\nin which any molecule will collide with it.\n\nSuppose the molecules of a gas are spheres\nof diameter d. Focus on a single molecule with\nthe average speed <v>. It will suffer collision with\nany molecule that comes within a distance d\nbetween the centres. In time ∆t, it sweeps a\nvolume πd2 <v> ∆t wherein any other molecule\n\nwill collide with it (see Fig. 13.7). If n is the\nnumber of molecules per unit volume, the\nmolecule suffers nπd2 <v> ∆t  collisions in time\n∆t. Thus the rate of collisions is  nπd2 <v> or the\ntime between two successive collisions is on the\naverage,\n\nτ  = 1/(nπ <v> d2 ) (13.38)\nThe average distance between two successive\n\ncollisions, called the mean free path l, is :\nl  = <v> τ = 1/(nπd2) (13.39)\nIn this derivation, we imagined the other\n\nmolecules to be at rest. But actually all molecules\nare moving and the collision rate is determined\nby the average relative velocity of the molecules.\nThus we need to replace <v> by <v\n\nr\n> in Eq.\n\n(13.38). A more exact treatment gives\n\n( )21/ 2l n dπ= (13.40)\nLet us estimate l and τ  for air molecules with\n\naverage speeds  <v> = ( 485m/s).

Almost but not quite.  One can see pollen grains of a flower being\npushed around by molecules of water. The size of the grain is ~ 10-5 m.  In 1827, a Scottish botanist\nRobert Brown, while examining, under a microscope, pollen grains of a flower suspended in water\nnoticed that they continuously moved about in a zigzag, random fashion.\n\nKinetic theory provides a simple explanation of the phenomenon. Any object suspended in water is\ncontinuously bombarded from all sides by the water molecules. Since the motion of molecules is random,\nthe number of molecules hitting the object in any direction is about the same as the number hitting in\nthe opposite direction. The small difference between these molecular hits is negligible compared to the\ntotal number of hits for an object of ordinary size, and we do not notice any movement of the object.\n\nWhen the object is sufficiently small but still visible under a microscope, the difference in molecular\nhits from different directions is not altogether negligible, i.e. the impulses and the torques given to the\nsuspended object through continuous bombardment by the molecules of the medium (water or some\nother fluid) do not exactly sum to zero. There is a net impulse and torque in this or that direction. The\nsuspended object thus, moves about in a zigzag manner and tumbles about randomly.  This motion\ncalled now ‘Brownian motion’ is a visible proof of molecular activity. In the last 50 years or so  molecules\nhave been seen by scanning tunneling and other special microscopes.\n\nIn 1987 Ahmed Zewail, an Egyptian scientist working in USA was able to observe not only the\nmolecules but also their detailed interactions. He did this by illuminating them with flashes of laser\nlight for very short durations, of the order of tens of femtoseconds and photographing them.  ( 1 femto-\nsecond = 10-15 s ). One could study even the formation and breaking of chemical bonds. That is really\nseeing !\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nKINETIC THEORY 337\n\nt\n\nAs expected, the mean free path given by\nEq. (13.40) depends inversely on the number\ndensity and the size of the molecules. In a highly\nevacuated tube n is rather small and the mean\nfree path can be as large as the length of the\ntube.\n\nExample 13.9 Estimate the mean free path\nfor a water molecule in water vapour at 373 K.\nUse information from Exercises 13.1 and\nEq. (13.41) above.\n\nAnswer The d for water vapour is same as that\nof air. The number density is inversely\nproportional to absolute temperature.\n\nSo \n25 25 –32732.7 10 2 10 m\n\n373\nn = × × = ×\n\nHence, mean free path –74 10 ml = × t\nNote that the mean free path is 100 times the\n\ninteratomic distance ~ 40 Å = 4 ×10-9 m calculated\nearlier. It is this large value of mean free path that\nleads to the typical gaseous behaviour. Gases can\nnot be confined without a container.\n\nUsing, the kinetic theory of gases, the bulk\nmeasurable properties like viscosity, heat\nconductivity and diffusion can be related to the\nmicroscopic parameters like molecular size. It\nis through such relations that the molecular\nsizes were first estimated.\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. The ideal gas equation connecting pressure (P ), volume (V ) and absolute temperature\n(T ) is\n\n                                         PV = µ RT     = k\nB\n NT\n\nwhere µ is the number of moles and N is the number of molecules. R and k\nB\n are universal\n\nconstants.\n\nR = 8.314 J mol–1 K–1,     k\nB\n  = \n\nA\n\nR\n\nN  \n  = 1.38 × 10–23 J K–1\n\nReal gases satisfy the ideal gas equation only approximately, more so at low pressures\nand high temperatures.\n\n2. Kinetic theory of an ideal gas gives the relation\n\n                                        \n21\n\n3\nP   n m v=\n\nwhere n is number density of molecules, m the mass of the molecule and 2v    is the\n\nmean of squared speed. Combined with the ideal gas equation it yields a kinetic\ninterpretation of temperature.\n\n21 3\n2 2\n\nB m v    k  T= ,  ( )1/22 rmsv v= 3 Bk T\nm\n\n=\n\nThis tells us that  the temperature of a gas is a measure of the average kinetic energy\nof a molecule, independent of the nature of the gas or molecule. In a mixture of gases at\na fixed temperature the heavier molecule has the lower average speed.\n\n3. The translational kinetic energy\n\nE = \n\n2\n\n3\n k\n\nB \nNT.\n\nThis leads to a relation\n\nPV = \n2\n\n3\n E\n\n4. The law of equipartition of energy states that if a system is in equilibrium at absolute\ntemperature T, the total energy is distributed equally in different energy modes of\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n338 PHYSICS\n\nabsorption, the energy in each mode being equal to ½ k\nB\n T. Each translational and\n\nrotational degree of freedom corresponds to one energy mode of absorption and has\nenergy ½ k\n\nB\n T. Each vibrational frequency has two modes of energy (kinetic and potential)\n\nwith corresponding energy equal to\n2 × ½ k\n\nB\n T = k\n\nB\n T.\n\n5. Using the law of equipartition of energy, the molar specific heats of gases can be\ndetermined and the values are in agreement with the experimental values of specific\nheats of several gases. The agreement can be improved by including vibrational modes\nof motion.\n\n6. The mean free path l is the average distance covered by a molecule between two successive\ncollisions :\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2 π\n = l\n\n n  d\n\nwhere n is the number density and d the diameter of the molecule.\n\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n1. Pressure of a fluid is not only exerted on the wall. Pressure exists everywhere in a fluid.\n\nAny layer of gas inside the volume of a container is in equilibrium because the pressure\nis the same on both sides of the layer.\n\n2. We should not have an exaggerated idea of the intermolecular distance in a gas. At\nordinary pressures and temperatures, this is only 10 times or so the interatomic distance\nin solids and liquids. What is different is the mean free path which in a gas is 100\ntimes the interatomic distance and 1000 times the size of the molecule.\n\n3. The law of equipartition of energy is stated thus: the energy for each degree of freedom\nin thermal equilibrium is ½ k\n\nB\n T. Each quadratic term in the total energy expression of\n\na molecule is to be counted as a degree of freedom. Thus, each vibrational mode gives\n2 (not 1) degrees of freedom (kinetic and potential energy modes), corresponding to the\nenergy 2 × ½ k\n\nB\n T = k\n\nB\n T.\n\n4. Molecules of air in a room do not all fall and settle on the ground (due to gravity)\nbecause of their high speeds and incessant collisions. In equilibrium, there is a very\nslight increase in density at lower heights (like in the atmosphere). The effect is small\nsince the potential energy (mgh) for ordinary heights is much less than the average\nkinetic energy ½ mv2 of the molecules.\n\n5. < v2 >  is not always equal to ( < v >)2. The average of a squared quantity is not necessarily\nthe square of the average. Can you find examples for this statement.\n\nEXERCISESEXERCISESEXERCISESEXERCISESEXERCISES\n\n13.113.113.113.113.1 Estimate the fraction of molecular volume to the actual volume occupied by oxygen\ngas at STP.

Both these motions are\n\nnon-repetitive. We have also learnt about uniform circular\n\nmotion and orbital motion of planets in the solar system. In\n\nthese cases, the motion is repeated after a certain interval of\n\ntime, that is, it is periodic. In your childhood, you must have\n\nenjoyed rocking in a cradle or swinging on a swing. Both\n\nthese motions are repetitive in nature but different from the\n\nperiodic motion of a planet. Here, the object moves to and fro\n\nabout a mean position. The pendulum of a wall clock executes\n\na similar motion. Examples of such periodic to and fro\n\nmotion abound: a boat tossing up and down in a river, the\n\npiston in a steam engine going back and forth, etc. Such a\n\nmotion is termed as oscillatory motion. In this chapter we\n\nstudy this motion.\n\nThe study of oscillatory motion is basic to physics; its\n\nconcepts are required for the understanding of many physical\n\nphenomena. In musical instruments, like the sitar, the guitar\n\nor the violin, we come across vibrating strings that produce\n\npleasing sounds. The membranes in drums and diaphragms\n\nin telephone and speaker systems vibrate to and fro about\n\ntheir mean positions. The vibrations of air molecules make\n\nthe propagation of sound possible. In a solid, the atoms vibrate\n\nabout their equilibrium positions, the average energy of\n\nvibrations being proportional to temperature. AC power\n\nsupply give voltage that oscillates alternately going positive\n\nand negative about the mean value (zero).\n\nThe description of a periodic motion, in general, and\n\noscillatory motion, in particular, requires some fundamental\n\nconcepts, like period, frequency, displacement, amplitude\n\nand phase. These concepts are developed in the next section.\n\n14.1 Introduction\n\n14.2 Periodic and oscillatory\nmotions\n\n14.3 Simple harmonic motion\n\n14.4 Simple harmonic motion\nand uniform circular\nmotion\n\n14.5 Velocity and acceleration\nin simple harmonic motion\n\n14.6 Force law for simple\nharmonic motion\n\n14.7 Energy in simple harmonic\nmotion\n\n14.8 Some systems executing\nsimple harmonic motion\n\n14.9 Damped simple harmonic\nmotion\n\n14.10 Forced oscillations and\nresonance\n\nSummary\n\nPoints to ponder\n\nExercises\n\nAdditional Exercises\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS342\n\n14.2 PERIODIC AND OSCILLATORY MOTIONS\n\nFig. 14.1 shows some periodic motions. Suppose\nan insect climbs up a ramp and falls down, it\ncomes back to the initial point and repeats the\nprocess identically. If you draw a graph of its\nheight above the ground versus time, it would\nlook something like Fig. 14.1 (a). If a child climbs\nup a step, comes down, and repeats the process\nidentically, its height above the ground would\nlook like that in Fig. 14.1 (b). When you play the\ngame of bouncing a ball off the ground, between\nyour palm and the ground, its height versus time\ngraph would look like the one in Fig. 14.1 (c).\nNote that both the curved parts in Fig. 14.1 (c)\nare sections of a parabola given by the Newton’s\nequation of motion (see section 3.6),\n\n21\n\n2\n + gth = ut  for downward motion, and\n\n21\n\n2\n – gth = ut  for upward motion,\n\nwith different values of u in each case. These\nare examples of periodic motion. Thus, a motion\nthat repeats itself at regular intervals of time is\ncalled periodic motion.\n\nFig. 14.1 Examples of periodic motion. The period T\n\nis shown in each case.\n\nVery often, the body undergoing periodic\nmotion has an equilibrium position somewhere\ninside its path. When the body is at this position\nno net external force acts on it. Therefore, if it is\nleft there at rest, it remains there forever. If the\nbody is given a small displacement from the\nposition, a force comes into play which tries to\nbring the body back to the equilibrium point,\ngiving rise to oscillations or vibrations. For\nexample, a ball placed in a bowl will be in\nequilibrium at the bottom. If displaced a little\nfrom the point, it will perform oscillations in the\nbowl. Every oscillatory motion is periodic, but\nevery periodic motion need not be oscillatory.\nCircular motion is a periodic motion, but it is\nnot oscillatory.\n\nThere is no significant difference between\noscillations and vibrations. It seems that when\nthe frequency is small, we call it oscillation (like,\nthe oscillation of a branch of a tree), while when\nthe frequency is high, we call it vibration (like,\nthe vibration of a string of a musical instrument).\n\nSimple harmonic motion is the simplest form\nof oscillatory motion. This motion arises when\nthe force on the oscillating body is directly\nproportional to its displacement from the mean\nposition, which is also the equilibrium position.\nFurther, at any point in its oscillation, this force\nis directed towards the mean position.\n\nIn practice, oscillating bodies eventually\ncome to rest at their equilibrium positions\nbecause of the damping due to friction and other\ndissipative causes.  However, they can be forced\nto remain oscillating by means of some external\nperiodic agency.  We discuss the phenomena of\ndamped and forced oscillations later in the\nchapter.\n\nAny material medium can be pictured as a\ncollection of a large number of coupled\noscillators. The collective oscillations of the\nconstituents of a medium manifest themselves\nas waves. Examples of waves include water\nwaves, seismic waves, electromagnetic waves.\nWe shall study the wave phenomenon in the next\nchapter.\n\n14.2.1 Period and frequency\n\nWe have seen that any motion that repeats itself\nat regular intervals of time is called periodic\nmotion. The smallest interval of time after\nwhich the motion is repeated is called its\nperiod. Let us denote the period by the symbol\nT. Its SI unit is second. For periodic motions,\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nOSCILLATIONS 343\n\nwhich are either too fast or too slow on the scale\nof seconds, other convenient units of time are\nused. The period of vibrations of a quartz crystal\nis expressed in units of microseconds (10–6 s)\nabbreviated as µs. On the other hand, the orbital\nperiod of the planet Mercury is 88 earth days.\nThe Halley’s comet appears after every 76 years.\n\nThe reciprocal of T gives the number of\nrepetitions that occur per unit time. This\nquantity is called the frequency of the periodic\nmotion. It is represented by the symbol ν. The\nrelation between ν and T is\n\nν  = 1/T  (14.1)\n\nThe unit of ν is thus s–1. After the discoverer of\nradio waves, Heinrich Rudolph Hertz (1857–1894),\na special name has been given to the unit of\nfrequency. It is called hertz (abbreviated as Hz).\nThus,\n\n1 hertz  = 1 Hz =1 oscillation per second =1s–1\n\n (14.2)\n\nNote, that the frequency, ν, is not necessarily\nan integer.\n\nu Example 14.1  On an average, a human\nheart is found to beat 75 times in a minute.\nCalculate its frequency and period.\n\nAnswer The beat frequency of heart = 75/(1 min)\n     = 75/(60 s)\n\n                                                    = 1.25 s–1\n\n                                                    = 1.25 Hz\n             The time period T         = 1/(1.25 s–1)\n                                                    = 0.8 s t\n14.2.2   Displacement\nIn section 4.2, we defined displacement of a\nparticle as the change in its position vector. In\n\nthis chapter, we use the term displacement\n\nin a more general sense. It refers to change\n\nwith time of any physical property under\n\nconsideration. For example, in case of rectilinear\nmotion of a steel ball on a surface, the distance\n\nfrom the starting point as a function of time is\n\nits position displacement. The choice of origin\n\nis a matter of convenience. Consider a block\n\nattached to a spring, the other end of the spring\n\nis fixed to a rigid wall [see Fig.14.2(a)]. Generally,\nit is convenient to measure displacement of the\n\nbody from its equilibrium position. For an\n\noscillating simple pendulum, the angle from the\nvertical as a function of time may be regarded\n\nas a displacement variable [see Fig.14.2(b)]. The\nterm displacement is not always to be referred\n\nFig. 14.2(a) A block attached to a spring, the other\n\nend of which is fixed to a rigid wall. The\n\nblock moves on a frictionless surface. The\n\nmotion of the block can be described in\n\nterms of its distance or displacement x\n\nfrom the equilibrium position.\n\nFig.14.2(b) An oscillating simple pendulum; its\nmotion can be described in terms of\n\nangular displacement θ from the vertical.\n\nin the context of position only. There can be\nmany other kinds of displacement variables. The\nvoltage across a capacitor, changing with time\nin an AC circuit, is also a displacement variable.\nIn the same way, pressure variations in time in\nthe propagation of sound wave, the changing\nelectric and magnetic fields in a light wave are\nexamples of displacement in different contexts.\nThe displacement variable may take both\npositive and negative values. In experiments on\noscillations, the displacement is measured for\ndifferent times.\n\nThe displacement can be represented by a\nmathematical function of time. In case of periodic\nmotion, this function is periodic in time. One of\nthe simplest periodic functions is given by\n\n    f (t) = A cos ωt                           (14.3a)\n\nIf the argument of this function, ωt, is\nincreased by an integral multiple of 2π radians,\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS344\n\nthe value of the function remains the same. The\nfunction f (t ) is then periodic and its period, T,\nis given by\n\n    \nω\nπ2\n\n=  T     (14.3b)\n\nThus, the function f (t) is periodic with period T,\n\nf (t) = f (t+T )\n\nThe same result is obviously correct if we\nconsider a sine function, f (t ) = A sin ωt. Further,\na linear combination of sine and cosine functions\nlike,\n\n       f (t )  =  A sin ωt + B cos ωt                 (14.3c)\nis also a periodic function with the same period\nT. Taking,\n\nA = D cos φ  and  B = D sin φ\n\nEq. (14.3c) can be written as,\n\nf (t) = D sin (ωt + φ ) ,                        (14.3d)\n\nHere D and φ are constant given by\n\n2 2 1\nand tanφ =  –D = A + B    \n\nB\n\nA\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\nThe great importance of periodic sine and\ncosine functions is due to a remarkable result\nproved by the French mathematician, Jean\nBaptiste Joseph Fourier (1768–1830): Any\nperiodic function can be expressed as a\nsuperposition of sine and cosine functions\nof different time periods with suitable\ncoefficients.\n\nu Example 14.2   Which of the following\nfunctions of time represent (a) periodic and\n(b) non-periodic motion? Give the period for\neach case of periodic motion [ω is any\npositive constant].\n(i) sin ωt + cos ωt\n(ii) sin ωt + cos 2 ωt + sin 4 ωt\n(iii) e–ωt\n\n(iv) log (ωt)\n\nAnswer\n\n(i) sin ωt + cos ωt is a periodic function, it can\n\nalso be written as 2  sin (ωt + π/4).\n\nNow 2  sin (ωt + π/4)= 2  sin (ωt + π/4+2π)\n\n       = 2  sin [ω (t + 2π/ω) + π/4]\n\nThe periodic time of the function is 2π/ω.\n\n(ii) This is an example of a periodic motion. It\ncan be noted that each term represents a\nperiodic function with a different angular\nfrequency. Since period is the least interval\nof time after which a function repeats its\nvalue, sin ωt has a period T\n\n0\n= 2π/ω ; cos 2 ωt\n\nhas a period π/ω =T\n0\n/2; and sin 4 ωt has a\n\nperiod 2π/4ω = T\n0\n/4. The period of the first\n\nterm is a multiple of the periods of the last\ntwo terms. Therefore, the smallest interval\nof time after which the sum of the three\nterms repeats is T\n\n0\n, and thus, the sum is a\n\nperiodic function with a period 2π/ω.\n\n(iii) The function e–ωt is not periodic, it\ndecreases monotonically with increasing\ntime and tends to zero as t → ∞ and thus,\nnever repeats its value.\n\n(iv) The function log (ωt ) increases\nmonotonically with time t. It, therefore,\nnever repeats its value and is a non-\nperiodic function. It may be noted that as\nt → ∞, log(ωt) diverges to ∞. It, therefore,\ncannot represent any kind of physical\ndisplacement.               t\n\n14.3 SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION\n\nConsider a particle oscillating back and forth\nabout the origin of an x-axis between the limits\n+A and –A as shown in Fig. 14.3. This oscillatory\nmotion is said to be simple harmonic if the\n\nFig. 14.3 A particle vibrating back and forth about\nthe origin of x-axis, between the limits +A\n\nand –A.\n\ndisplacement x of the particle from the origin\nvaries with time as :\n\nx (t) = A cos (ω t + φ ) (14.4)\nwhere A, ω and φ are constants.\n\nThus, simple harmonic motion (SHM) is not\nany periodic motion but one in which\ndisplacement is a sinusoidal function of time.\nFig. 14.4 shows the positions of a particle\nexecuting SHM at discrete value of time, each\ninterval of time being T/4, where T is the period\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nOSCILLATIONS 345\n\nof motion. Fig. 14.5 plots the graph of x versus t,\nwhich gives the values of displacement as a\ncontinuous function of time. The quantities A,\nω and φ which characterize a given SHM have\nstandard names, as summarised in Fig. 14.6.\nLet us understand these quantities.\n\nThe amplitutde A of SHM is the magnitude\nof maximum displacement of the particle.\n[Note, A can be taken to be positive without\nany loss of generality]. As the cosine function\nof time varies from +1 to –1, the displacement\nvaries between the extremes A and – A. Two\nsimple harmonic motions may have same ω\nand φ but different amplitudes A and B, as\nshown in Fig. 14.7 (a).\n\nFig. 14.4 The location of the particle in SHM at the\ndiscrete values t = 0, T/4, T/2, 3T/4, T,\n\n5T/4. The time after which motion repeats\n\nitself is T. T will remain fixed, no matter\n\nwhat location you choose as the initial (t =\n\n0) location. The speed is maximum for zero\n\ndisplacement (at x = 0) and zero at the\n\nextremes of motion.\n\nFig. 14.5 Displacement as a continuous function of\ntime for simple harmonic motion.\n\nFig. 14.7 (b) A plot obtained from Eq. (14.4). The\ncurves 3 and 4 are for φ = 0 and -π/4\nrespectively. The amplitude A is same for\n\nboth the plots.\n\nFig. 14.7 (a) A plot of displacement as a function of\ntime as obtained from Eq. (14.4) with\n\nφ = 0. The curves 1 and 2 are for two\ndifferent amplitudes A and B.\n\nx (t) : displacement x as a function of time t\nA : amplitude\nω : angular frequency\nωt + φ : phase (time-dependent)\nφ : phase constant\n\nFig. 14.6  The meaning of standard symbols\nin Eq. (14.4)\n\nWhile the amplitude A is fixed for a given\nSHM, the state of motion (position and velocity)\nof the particle at any time t is determined by the\nargument (ωt + φ) in the cosine function. This\ntime-dependent quantity, (ωt + φ) is called the\nphase of the motion. The value of plase at t = 0\nis φ and is called the phase constant (or phase\nangle). If the amplitude is known, φ can be\ndetermined from the displacement at t = 0. Two\nsimple harmonic motions may have the same A\nand ω but different phase angle φ, as shown in\nFig. 14.7 (b).\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS346\n\nFinally, the quantity ω can be seen to be\nrelated to the period of motion T. Taking, for\nsimplicity, φ = 0 in Eq. (14.4), we have\n\nx(t ) = A cos ωt   (14.5)\n\nSince the motion has a period T, x (t) is equal to\nx (t + T ). That is,\n\nA cos ωt = A cos ω (t + T )      (14.6)\n\nNow the cosine function is periodic with period\n2π, i.e., it first repeats itself when the argument\nchanges by 2π. Therefore,\n\nω(t + T ) = ωt + 2π\n\nthat is ω = 2π/ T (14.7)\n\nω is called the angular frequency of SHM. Its\nS.I. unit is radians per second. Since the\nfrequency of oscillations is simply 1/T, ω is 2π\ntimes the frequency of oscillation. Two simple\nharmonic motions may have the same A and φ,\nbut different ω, as seen in Fig. 14.8. In this plot\nthe curve (b) has half the period and twice the\nfrequency of the curve (a).\n\nThis function represents a simple harmonic\nmotion having a period T = 2π/ω and a\nphase angle (–π/4) or (7π/4)\n\n(b) sin2 ωt\n= ½ – ½ cos 2 ωt\n\nThe function is periodic having a period\nT = π/ω. It also represents a harmonic\nmotion with the point of equilibrium\n\noccurring at ½ instead of zero.                      t\n\n14.4  SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION AND\nUNIFORM CIRCULAR MOTION\n\nIn this section, we show that the projection of\nuniform circular motion on a diameter of the\ncircle follows simple harmonic motion. A\nsimple experiment (Fig. 14.9) helps us visualise\nthis connection. Tie a ball to the end of a string\nand make it move in a horizontal plane about\na fixed point with a constant angular speed.\nThe ball would then perform a uniform circular\nmotion in the horizontal plane. Observe the\nball sideways or from the front, fixing your\nattention in the plane of motion. The ball will\nappear to execute to and fro motion along a\nhorizontal line with the point of rotation as\nthe midpoint. You could alternatively observe\nthe shadow of the ball on a wall which is\nperpendicular to the plane of the circle. In this\nprocess what we are observing is the motion\nof the ball on a diameter of the circle normal\nto the direction of viewing.\n\nFig. 14.9 Circular motion of a ball in a plane viewed\nedge-on is SHM.\n\nFig. 14.8   Plots of Eq. (14.4) for φ  = 0 for two different\nperiods.\n\nu Example 14.3  Which of the following\nfunctions of time represent (a) simple\nharmonic motion and (b) periodic but not\nsimple harmonic? Give the period for each\ncase.\n(1) sin ωt – cos ωt\n(2) sin2 ωt\n\nAnswer\n(a) sin ωt – cos ωt\n\n= sin ωt – sin (π/2 – ωt)\n= 2 cos (π/4)  sin (ωt – π/4)\n\n                   = √2 sin (ωt – π/4)\n\nFig. 14.10 describes the same situation\nmathematically. Suppose a particle P is moving\nuniformly on a circle of radius A with angular\nspeed ω. The sense of rotation is anticlockwise.\nThe initial position vector of the particle, i.e.,\n\nthe vector OP  at t = 0 makes an angle of φ with\nthe positive direction of x-axis. In time t, it will\ncover a further angle ωt and its position vector\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nOSCILLATIONS 347\n\nwill make an angle of ωt + φ with the +ve\nx-axis. Next, consider the projection of the\nposition vector OP on the x-axis. This will be\nOP′. The position of P′ on the x-axis, as the\nparticle P moves on the circle, is given by\n\nx(t ) =  A cos (ωt + φ )\nwhich is the defining equation of SHM. This\nshows that if P moves uniformly on a circle,\nits projection P′ on a diameter of the circle\nexecutes SHM. The particle P and the circle\non which it moves are sometimes referred to\nas the reference particle and the reference circle,\nrespectively.\n\nWe can take projection of the motion of P on\nany diameter, say the y-axis. In that case, the\ndisplacement y(t) of P′ on the y-axis is given by\n\ny = A sin (ωt + φ )\nwhich is also an SHM of the same amplitude\nas that of the projection on x-axis, but differing\nby a phase of π/2.\n\nIn spite of this connection between circular\n\nmotion and SHM, the force acting on a particle\n\nin linear simple harmonic motion is very\n\ndifferent from the centripetal force needed to\n\nkeep a particle in uniform circular motion.\n\nu Example 14.4   The figure given below\ndepicts two circular motions. The radius\nof the circle, the period of revolution, the\ninitial position and the sense of revolution\nare indicated in the figures. Obtain the\nsimple harmonic motions of the\nx-projection of the radius vector of the\nrotating particle P in each case.\n\nAnswer\n\n(a) At t = 0, OP makes an angle of 45o = π/4 rad\nwith the (positive direction of ) x-axis. After\n\ntime t, it covers an angle t\nT\n\nπ2  in the\n\nanticlockwise sense, and makes an angle\n\nof \n \n\n4\n + \n\n2 ππ\nt\n\nT\n  with the x-axis.\n\nThe projection of OP on the x-axis at time t\nis given by,\n\nx (t) = A cos \n2\n\n + \n4\n\nπ π\n\nT\nt\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\nFor T = 4 s,\n\nx(t) = A cos  \n2\n\n4\n + \n\n4\n\nπ π\nt\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\nwhich is a SHM of amplitude A, period 4 s,\n\nand an initial phase* = \n4\n\nπ\n \n.\n\n* The natural unit of angle is radian, defined through the ratio of arc to radius. Angle is a dimensionless\nquantity. Therefore it is not always necessary to mention the unit ‘radian’ when we use π, its multiples\nor submultiples. The conversion between radian and degree is not similar to that between metre and\n\ncentimetre or mile. If the argument of a trigonometric function is stated without units, it is understood\n\nthat the unit is radian. On the other hand, if degree is to be used as the unit of angle, then it must be\n\nshown explicitly. For example, sin(150) means sine of 15 degree, but sin(15) means sine of 15 radians.\n\nHereafter, we will often drop ‘rad’ as the unit, and it should be understood that whenever angle is\n\nmentioned as a numerical value, without units, it is to be taken as radians.\n\nFig. 14.10\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS348\n\n(b) In this case at t = 0, OP makes an angle of\n\n90o = \n2\n\nπ  with the x-axis. After a time t, it\n\ncovers an angle of 2 t\nT\n\nπ  in the clockwise\n\nsense and makes an angle of  \nπ π\n\n2\n  \n\n2\n−\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7T\n\nt\n\nwith the x-axis. The projection of OP on the\nx-axis at time t is given by\n\nx(t) = B cos \nπ π\n\n2\n  \n\n2\n−\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7T\n\nt\n\n= B sin \n2π\n\nT\nt\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\nFor T = 30 s,\n\n           x(t) = B sin \nπ\n\n15\nt\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\nWriting this as x (t ) = B cos \nπ π\n\n15\n  \n\n2\nt −\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n, and\n\ncomparing with Eq. (14.4).  We find that this\n\nrepresents a SHM of amplitude B, period 30 s,\n\nand an initial phase of \n2\n\nπ\n− . t\n\n14.5 VELOCITY AND ACCELERATION IN\nSIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION\n\nThe speed of a particle v in uniform circular\n\nmotion is its angular speed ω times the radius\nof the circle A.\n\nv = ω A      (14.8)\n\nThe direction of velocity v at a time t is along\nthe tangent to the circle at the point where the\nparticle is located at that instant. From the\ngeometry of Fig. 14.11, it is clear that the velocity\nof the projection particle P′ at time t is\n\nv(t ) = –ωA sin (ωt + φ )              (14.9)\n\nwhere the negative sign shows that v (t) has a\ndirection opposite to the positive direction of\nx-axis. Eq. (14.9) gives the instantaneous\nvelocity of a particle executing SHM, where\ndisplacement is given by Eq. (14.4). We can, of\ncourse, obtain this equation without using\ngeometrical argument, directly by differentiating\n(Eq. 14.4) with respect of t:\n\nd\n( )\n\nd\nv(t) = x t\n\nt\n(14.10)\n\nThe method of reference circle can be similarly\nused for obtaining instantaneous acceleration\nof a particle undergoing SHM. We know that the\ncentripetal acceleration of a particle P in uniform\ncircular motion has a magnitude v2/A or ω2A,\nand it is directed towards the centre i.e., the\ndirection is along PO. The instantaneous\nacceleration of the projection particle P′ is then\n(See Fig. 14.12)\n\na (t)  = –ω2A cos (ωt + φ)\n\n               = –ω2x (t) (14.11)\n\nFig. 14.11 The velocity, v (t), of the particle P′ is the\nprojection of the velocity v  of the\nreference particle, P.\n\nFig. 14.12 The acceleration, a(t), of the particle P′ is\nthe projection of the acceleration a of the\nreference particle P.\n\nEq. (14.11) gives the acceleration of a particle\nin SHM. The same equation can again be\nobtained directly by differentiating velocity v(t)\ngiven by Eq. (14.9) with respect to time:\n\nd\n( ) ( )\n\nd\na t  = v t\n\nt\n(14.12)\n\nWe note from Eq. (14.11) the important\nproperty that acceleration of a particle in SHM\nis proportional to displacement. For x(t) > 0,\na(t) < 0 and for  x(t) < 0, a(t) > 0. Thus, whatever\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nOSCILLATIONS 349\n\nthe value of x between –A and A, the acceleration\na(t) is always directed towards the centre.\nFor simplicity, let us put φ = 0 and write the\nexpression for x (t), v (t) and a(t)\nx(t) = A cos ωt, v(t) = – ω Asin ωt, a(t)=–ω2 A cos ωt\nThe corresponding plots are shown in Fig. 14.13.\nAll quantities vary sinusoidally with time; only\ntheir maxima differ and the different plots differ\nin phase. x varies between –A to A; v(t) varies\nfrom –ωA to ωA and a(t) from –ω2A to ω2A. With\nrespect to displacement plot, velocity plot has a\nphase difference of π/2 and acceleration plot\nhas a phase difference of π.\n\n(b) Using Eq. (14.9), the speed of the body\n= – (5.0 m)(2π s–1) sin [(2π s–1) ×1.5 s\n+ π/4]\n= – (5.0 m)(2π s–1) sin [(3π + π/4)]\n\n       = 10π × 0.707 m s–1\n       = 22 m s–1\n\n(c) Using Eq.(14.10), the acceleration of the\nbody\n\n= –(2π s–1)2 × displacement\n           = – (2π s–1)2 × (–3.535 m)\n           = 140 m s–2 t\n\n14.6 FORCE LAW FOR SIMPLE HARMONIC\nMOTION\n\nUsing Newton’s second law of motion, and the\nexpression for acceleration of a particle\nundergoing SHM (Eq. 14.11), the force acting\non a particle of mass m in SHM is\n\nF (t )  = ma\n\n    = –mω2 x (t )\n\ni.e., F (t )  = –k x (t ) (14.13)\n\nwhere  k = mω2 (14.14a)\n\nor ω =  \nk\n\nm\n(14.14b)\n\nLike acceleration, force is always directed\ntowards the mean position—hence it is sometimes\ncalled the restoring force in SHM. To summarise\nthe discussion so far, simple harmonic motion can\nbe defined in two equivalent ways, either by Eq.\n(14.4) for displacement or by Eq. (14.13) that gives\nits force law. Going from Eq. (14.4) to Eq. (14.13)\nrequired us to differentiate two times. Likewise,\nby integrating the force law Eq. (14.13) two times,\nwe can get back Eq. (14.4).\n\nNote that the force in Eq. (14.13) is linearly\nproportional to x(t). A particle oscillating under\nsuch a force is, therefore, calling a linear\nharmonic oscillator. In the real world, the force\nmay contain small additional terms proportional\nto x2, x3, etc. These then are called non-linear\noscillators.\n\nu Example 14.6 Two identical springs of\nspring constant k are attached to a block\nof mass m and to fixed supports as shown\nin Fig. 14.14. Show that when the mass is\ndisplaced from its equilibrium position on\neither side, it executes a simple harmonic\nmotion. Find the period of oscillations.\n\nFig. 14.13 Displacement, velocity and acceleration of\na particle in simple harmonic motion have\n\nthe same period T, but they differ in phase\n\nu Example 14.5  A body oscillates with SHM\naccording to the equation (in SI units),\n\n     x = 5 cos [2π t + π/4].\n\nAt t = 1.5 s, calculate the (a) displacement,\n(b) speed and (c) acceleration of the body.\n\nAnswer The angular frequency ω of the body\n= 2π s–1 and its time period T = 1 s.\nAt t = 1.5 s\n(a) displacement = (5.0 m) cos [(2π s–1) ×\n\n1.5 s + π/4]\n= (5.0 m) cos [(3π + π/4)]\n= –5.0 × 0.707 m\n= –3.535 m\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS350\n\nFig. 14.14\n\nAnswer Let the mass be displaced by a small\ndistance x to the right side of the equilibrium\nposition, as shown in Fig. 14.15. Under this\n\nsituation the spring on the left side gets\n\nFig. 14.15\n\nelongated by a length equal to x and that on\n\nthe right side gets compressed by the same\n\nlength. The forces acting on the mass are\n\nthen,\n\nF\n1\n   = –k x (force exerted by the spring on\n\nthe left side, trying to pull the\n\nmass towards the mean\n\nposition)\n\nF\n2 \n  =\n\n  \n–k x (force exerted by the spring on\n\nthe right side, trying to push the\n\nmass towards the mean\n\nposition)\n\nThe net force, F, acting on the mass is then\n\ngiven by,\n\nF   = –2kx\n\nHence the force acting on the mass is\n\nproportional to the displacement and is directed\n\ntowards the mean position; therefore, the motion\n\nexecuted by the mass is simple harmonic. The\n\ntime period of oscillations is,\n\nT = 2  \nm\n\n2k\nπ t\n\n14.7 ENERGY IN SIMPLE HARMONIC\nMOTION\n\nBoth kinetic and potential energies of a particle\n\nin SHM vary between zero and their maximum\n\nvalues.\n\nIn section14.5 we have seen that the velocity\n\nof a particle executing SHM, is a periodic\n\nfunction of time. It is zero at the extreme positions\n\nof displacement. Therefore, the kinetic energy (K)\n\nof such a particle, which is defined as\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\nmv =  K\n\n2 2 21\nsin ( + )\n\n2\n= m A  t  ω ω φ\n\n2\n \n\n1\nsin ( + )\n\n2\n\n2\n=  k A t ω φ     (14.15)\n\nis also a periodic function of time, being zero\n\nwhen the displacement is maximum and\n\nmaximum when the particle is at the mean\n\nposition. Note, since the sign of v is immaterial\n\nin K, the period of K is T/2.\n\nWhat is the potential energy (U) of a particle\n\nexecuting simple harmonic motion? In\n\nChapter 6, we have seen that the concept of\n\npotential energy is possible only for conservative\n\nforces. The spring force F = –kx is a conservative\n\nforce, with associated potential energy\n\n21\n\n2\nU = k x (14.16)\n\nHence the potential energy of a particle\nexecuting simple harmonic motion is,\n\nU(x)  =   2\n\n2\n\n1\nx k \n\n         \n2 2\n\n \n1\n\ncos ( + )\n2\n\n= k A t ω φ  (14.17)\n\nThus, the potential energy of a particle\n\nexecuting simple harmonic motion is also\n\nperiodic, with period T/2, being zero at the mean\n\nposition and maximum at the extreme\n\ndisplacements.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nOSCILLATIONS 351\n\nIt follows from Eqs. (14.15) and (14.17) that\n\nthe total energy, E, of the system is,\n\nE  = U + K\n\n2 2 2 2\n  \n\n1 1\ncos ( + ) + sin ( + )\n\n2 2\n=  k A t  k A t ω φ ω φ\n\n2 2 21\ncos ( + ) + sin ( + )\n\n2\n=  k A t t ω φ ω φ\uf8ee \uf8f9\uf8f0 \uf8fb\n\nUsing the familiar trigonometric identity, the\nvalue of the expression in the brackets is unity.\nThus,\n\n21\n\n2\nE =  k A (14.18)\n\nThe total mechanical energy of a harmonic\n\noscillator is thus independent of time as expected\n\nfor motion under any conservative force. The\n\ntime and displacement dependence of the\n\npotential and kinetic energies of a linear simple\n\nharmonic oscillator are shown in\n\nFig. 14.16.\n\nObserve that both kinetic energy and\n\npotential energy in SHM are seen to be always\n\npositive in Fig. 14.16. Kinetic energy can, of\n\ncourse, be never negative, since it is\n\nproportional to the square of speed. Potential\n\nenergy is positive by choice of the undermined\n\nconstant in potential energy. Both kinetic\n\nenergy and potential energy peak twice during\n\neach period of SHM. For x = 0, the energy is\n\nkinetic; at the extremes x = ±A, it is all potential\n\nenergy. In the course of motion between these\n\nlimits, kinetic energy increases at the expense\n\nof potential energy or vice-versa.\n\nu Example 14.7  A block whose mass is 1 kg\nis fastened to a spring. The spring has a\nspring constant of 50 N m–1. The block is\npulled to a distance x = 10 cm from its\nequilibrium position at x = 0 on a frictionless\nsurface from rest at t = 0. Calculate the\nkinetic, potential and total energies of the\nblock when it is 5 cm away from the mean\nposition.\n\nAnswer The block executes SHM, its angular\nfrequency, as given by Eq. (14.14b), is\n\nω =  \nk\n\nm\n\n =  \n50 N m\n\n– 1\n\n1kg\n\n             = 7.07 rad s–1\n\nIts displacement at any time t is then given by,\n\nx(t) = 0.1 cos (7.07t )\n\nTherefore, when the particle is 5 cm away from\nthe mean position, we have\n\n0.05 = 0.1 cos (7.07t )\n\nOr cos (7.07t ) = 0.5 and hence\n\nsin (7.07t )  =\n3\n\n2\n \n\n \n= 0.866\n\nFig. 14.16 Kinetic energy, potential energy and total\nenergy as a function of time [shown in (a)]\n\nand displacement [shown in (b)] of a particle\n\nin SHM. The kinetic energy and potential\n\nenergy both repeat after a period T/2. The\n\ntotal energy remains constant at all t or x.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS352\n\nThen, the velocity of the block at x = 5 cm is\n\n      = 0.1 × 7.07 × 0.866 m s–1\n\n          = 0.61 m s–1\n\nHence the K.E. of the block,\n\n \n2\n\n1\n = 2  vm\n\n           = ½[1kg × (0.6123 m s–1 )2 ]\n\n           = 0.19 J\n\nThe P.E. of the block,\n\n  \n2\n\n1\n = 2x k \n\n           = ½(50 N m–1 × 0.05 m × 0.05 m)\n           = 0.0625 J\n\nThe total energy of the block at x = 5 cm,\n\n           =  K.E. + P.E.\n\n           =  0.25 J\n\nwe also know that at maximum displacement,\nK.E. is zero and hence the total energy of the\nsystem is equal to the P.E. Therefore, the total\nenergy of the system,\n\n          = ½(50 N m–1 ×  0.1 m × 0.1 m )\n\n          = 0.25 J\nwhich is same as the sum of the two energies at\na displacement of 5 cm. This is in conformity\nwith the principle of conservation of energy.   t\n\n14.8   SOME SYSTEMS EXECUTING SIMPLE\nHARMONIC MOTION\n\nThere are no physical examples of absolutely\npure simple harmonic motion. In practice we\ncome across systems that execute simple\nharmonic motion approximately under certain\nconditions. In the subsequent part of this\nsection, we discuss the motion executed by some\nsuch systems.\n\n14.8.1  Oscillations due to a Spring\n\nThe simplest observable example of simple\nharmonic motion is the small oscillations of a\nblock of mass m fixed to a spring, which in turn\nis fixed to a rigid wall as shown in Fig. 14.17.\nThe block is placed on a frictionless horizontal\nsurface. If the block is pulled on one side and is\nreleased, it then executes a to and fro motion\nabout the mean position. Let x = 0, indicate the\nposition of the centre of the block when the\n\nspring is in equilibrium. The positions marked\nas –A and +A indicate the maximum\ndisplacements to the left and the right of the\nmean position. We have already learnt that\nsprings have special properties, which were first\ndiscovered by the English physicist Robert\nHooke. He had shown that such a system when\ndeformed, is subject to a restoring force, the\nmagnitude of which is proportional to the\ndeformation or the displacement and acts in\nopposite direction.  This is known as Hooke’s\nlaw (Chapter 9). It holds good for displacements\nsmall in comparison to the length of the spring.\nAt any time t, if the displacement of the block\nfrom its mean position is x, the restoring force F\nacting on the block is,\n\nF (x)  = –k x     (14.19)\n\nThe constant of proportionality, k, is called\nthe spring constant, its value is governed by the\nelastic properties of the spring. A stiff spring has\nlarge k and a soft spring has small k. Equation\n(14.19) is same as the force law for SHM and\ntherefore the system executes a simple harmonic\nmotion. From Eq. (14.14) we have,\n\n =  ω\nk\n\nm\n   (14.20)\n\nand the period, T, of the oscillator is given by,\n\n  = 2  \nm\n\nT\nk\n\nπ (14.21)\n\nStiff springs have high value of k (spring\nconstant). A block of small mass m attached to\na stiff spring will have, according to Eq. (14.20),\nlarge oscillation frequency, as expected\nphysically.\n\nFig. 14.17 A linear simple harmonic oscillator\nconsisting of a block of mass m attached\n\nto a spring.

You can also make your own\npendulum by tying a piece of stone to a long\n\nunstretchable thread, approximately 100 cm\n\nlong.  Suspend your pendulum from a suitable\n\nsupport so that it is free to oscillate. Displace\n\nthe stone to one side by a small distance and\n\nlet it go. The stone executes a to and fro motion,\n\nit is periodic with a period of about two seconds.\nWe shall show that this periodic motion is\n\nsimple harmonic for small displacements from\nthe mean position. Consider simple pendulum\n— a small bob of mass m tied to an inextensible\nmassless string of length L. The other end of\n\nthe string is fixed to a rigid support. The bob\n\noscillates in a plane about the vertical line\n\nthrough the support. Fig. 14.18(a) shows this\n\nsystem. Fig. 14.18(b) is a kind of ‘free-body’\n\ndiagram of the simple pendulum showing the\n\nforces acting on the bob.\n\nu  Example 14.8  A 5 kg collar is attached\nto a spring of spring constant 500 N m–1.

He observed that the motion of the\nchandelier was periodic. The system is a kind\n\n(a)\n\n (b)\n\nFig. 14.18 (a) A bob oscillating about its mean\nposition. (b) The radial force T-mg cosθ\nprovides centripetal force but no torque\n\nabout the support. The tangential force\n\nmg sinθ provides the restoring torque.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS354\n\nLet θ be the angle made by the string with\nthe vertical. When the bob is at the mean\n\nposition, θ = 0\nThere are only two forces acting on the bob;\n\nthe tension T along the string and the vertical\n\nforce due to gravity (=mg). The force mg can be\n\nresolved into the component mg cosθ along the\nstring and mg sinθ perpendicular to it. Since\nthe motion of the bob is along a circle of length\n\nL and centre at the support point, the bob has\n\na radial acceleration (ω2L) and also a tangental\nacceleration; the latter arises since motion along\n\nthe arc of the circle is not uniform. The radial\n\nacceleration is provided by the net radial force\n\nT –mg cosθ, while the tangential acceleration is\nprovided by mg sinθ. It is more convenient to\nwork with torque about the support since the\n\nradial force gives zero torque. Torque τ about\nthe support is entirely provided by the tangental\n\ncomponent of force\n\nτ =  –L (mg sinθ ) (14.22)\n\nThis is the restoring torque that tends to reduce\nangular displacement — hence the negative\nsign. By Newton’s law of rotational motion,\n\nτ   =  I α (14.23)\n\nwhere I is the moment of inertia of the system\nabout the support and α is the angular\nacceleration. Thus,\n\nI α = –m g sin θ   L (14.24)\n\nOr,\n\nα  =  sin  \nm g L\n  \n\nI\n θ− (14.25)\n\nWe can simplify Eq. (14.25) if we assume that\nthe displacement θ is small. We know that sin θ\ncan be expressed as,\n\nsin  ± ...\n3! 5!\n\n  \nθ θ\n\nθ θ\n3 5\n\n  =  − + (14.26)\n\nwhere θ is in radians.\nNow if θ  is small, sin θ can be approximated\n\nby θ and Eq. (14.25) can then be written as,\n\n α θ  =  −  \nmgL\n\nI\n (14.27)\n\nIn Table 14.1, we have listed the angle θ in\ndegrees, its equivalent in radians, and the value\n\nSHM - how small should the amplitude be?\n\nWhen you perform the experiment to\ndetermine the time period of a simple\npendulum, your teacher tells you to keep\nthe amplitude small. But have you ever\nasked how small is small? Should the\namplitude to 50, 20, 10, or 0.50? Or could it\nbe 100, 200, or 300?\n\nTo appreciate this, it would be better to\nmeasure the time period for different\namplitudes, up to large amplitudes. Of\ncourse, for large oscillations, you will have\nto take care that the pendulum oscillates\nin a vertical plane. Let us denote the time\nperiod for small-amplitude oscillations as\nT (0) and write the time period for amplitude\nθ\n\n0\n as T(θ\n\n0\n) = cT (0), where c is the multiplying\n\nfactor. If you plot a graph of c versus θ\n0\n,\n\nyou will get values somewhat like this:\n\nθ\n0\n\n: 200 450 500 700 900\n\nc : 1.02 1.04 1.05 1.10 1.18\n\nThis means that the error in the time\nperiod is about 2% at an amplitude of 200,\n5% at an amplitude of 500, and 10% at an\namplitude of 700 and 18% at an amplitude\nof 900.\n\nIn the experiment, you will never be able\nto measure T (0) because this means there\nare no oscillations. Even theoretically,\nsin θ  is exactly equal to θ  only for θ  = 0.\nThere will be some inaccuracy for all other\nvalues of θ . The difference increases with\nincreasing θ . Therefore we have to decide\nhow much error we can tolerate. No\nmeasurement is ever perfectly accurate.\nYou must also consider questions like\nthese: What is the accuracy of the\nstopwatch? What is your own accuracy in\nstarting and stopping the stopwatch? You\nwill realise that the accuracy in your\nmeasurements at this level is never better\nthan 5% or 10%. Since the above table\nshows that the time period of the pendulum\nincreases hardly by 5% at an amplitude of\n500 over its low amplitude value, you could\nvery well keep the amplitude to be 50° in\nyour experiments.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nOSCILLATIONS 355\n\nof the function sin θ . From this table it can be\nseen that for θ as large as 20 degrees, sin θ is\nnearly the same as θ expressed in radians.\n\nTable 14.1  sin θθθθθ as a function of angle θθθθθ\n\nEquation (14.27) is mathematically, identical\n\nto Eq. (14.11) except that the variable is angular\n\ndisplacement. Hence we have proved that for\n\nsmall θ, the motion of the bob is simple harmonic.\nFrom Eqs. (14.27) and (14.11),\n\nω  =  \nmgL\n\nI\n \n\nand\n\n \nI\n\nT  \nmgL\n\nπ  = 2       (14.28)\n\nNow since the string of the simple pendulum\nis massless, the moment of inertia I is simply\nmL2. Eq. (14.28) then gives the well-known\nformula for time period of a simple pendulum.\n\nL\nT  \n\ng\nπ  =  2     (14.29)\n\nu Example 14.9 What is the length of a\nsimple pendulum, which ticks seconds ?\n\nAnswer From Eq.

Why does it\n\nhappen ? This is because the air drag and the\n\nfriction at the support oppose the motion of the\n\npendulum and dissipate its energy gradually.\n\nThe pendulum is said to execute damped\noscillations. In dampled oscillations, the energy\nof the system is dissipated continuously; but,\n\nfor small damping, the oscillations remain\n\napproximately periodic. The dissipating forces\n\nare generally the frictional forces. To understand\n\nthe effect of such external forces on the motion\n\nof an oscillator, let us consider a system as\nshown in Fig. 14.19. Here a block of mass m\n\nconnected to an elastic spring of spring constant\n\nk oscillates vertically. If the block is pushed down\n\na little and released, its angular frequency of\n\noscillation is ω =\nk\n\nm\n, as seen in Eq. (14.20).\n\nHowever, in practice, the surrounding medium\n(air) will exert a damping force on the motion of\nthe block and the mechanical energy of the\nblock-spring system will decrease. The energy\nloss will appear as heat of the surrounding\nmedium (and the block also) [Fig. 14.19].\n\n(degrees) (radians) sin\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS356\n\nThe damping force depends on the nature of\nthe surrounding medium. If the block is\nimmersed in a liquid, the magnitude of damping\nwill be much greater and the dissipation of\nenergy much faster. The damping force is\ngenerally proportional to velocity of the bob.\n[Remember Stokes’ Law, Eq. (10.19)] and acts\nopposite to the direction of velocity. If the\ndamping force is denoted by F\n\nd\n, we have\n\nF\nd\n  = –b v     (14.30)\n\nwhere the positive constant b depends on\n\ncharacteristics of the medium (viscosity, for\n\nexample) and the size and shape of the block,\n\netc. Eq. (14.30) is usually valid only for small\nvelocity.\n\nWhen the mass m is attached to the spring\n(hung vertically as shown in Fig. 14.19) and\nreleased, the spring will elongate a little and the\nmass will settle at some height. This position,\nshown by O in Fig 14.19, is the equilibrium\nposition of the mass. If the mass is pulled down\nor pushed up a little, the restoring force on the\nblock due to the spring is F\n\nS\n = –kx, where x is\n\nthe displacement* of the mass from its\nequilibrium position. Thus, the total force acting\non the mass at any time t, is F = –kx –bv.\n\nIf a(t) is the acceleration of mass at time t,\nthen by Newton’s Law of Motion applied along\nthe direction of motion, we have\n\nm a(t ) = –k x(t ) – b v(t ) (14.31)\nHere we have dropped the vector notation\n\nbecause we are discussing one-dimensional\n\nmotion.\n\nUsing the first and second derivatives of x (t)\n\nfor v (t) and a (t), respectively, we have\n\n2\nd d\n\ndd\n2\n\nx x\nm  b   k x  0\n\ntt\n     + + = (14.32)\n\nThe solution of Eq. (14.32) describes the\nmotion of the block under the influence of a\ndamping force which is proportional to velocity.\nThe solution is found to be of the form\n\nx(t)  =   A e–b t/2m cos (ω′t + φ ) (14.33)\n\nwhere A  is the amplitude and ω ′ is the angular\nfrequency of the damped oscillator given by,\n\n  \n4m\n\nb\n\nm\n\nk\n'\n\n2\n\n2\n\n   −= ω (14.34)\n\nIn this function, the cosine function has a\n\nperiod 2π/ω′ but the function x(t) is not strictly\nperiodic because of the factor e–b t/2m which\ndecreases continuously with time. However, if the\ndecrease is small in one time period T, the motion\nrepresented by Eq. (14.33) is approximately\nperiodic.\n\nThe solution, Eq. (14.33), can be graphically\nrepresented as shown in Fig. 14.20. We can\nregard it as a cosine function whose amplitude,\nwhich is Ae–b t/2m, gradually decreases with time.\n\n* Under gravity, the block will be at a certain equilibrium position O on the spring; x here represents the\ndisplacement from that position.\n\nFig. 14.20 A damped oscillator is approximately\nperiodic with decreasing amplitude of\n\noscillation. With greater damping,\n\noscillations die out faster.\n\nNow the mechanical energy of the undamped\noscillator is 1/2 kA2. For a damped oscillator,\nthe amplitude is not constant but depends on\ntime. For small damping, we may use the same\nexpression but regard the amplitude as A e–bt/2m.\n\n1\n( )\n\n2\n\n2 –b t/m\nE t    k A  e   = (14.35)\n\nEquation (14.35) shows that the total energy\nof the system decreases exponentially with time.\nNote that small damping means that the\n\ndimensionless ratio \uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n\uf8eb\n \n\nm k\n\nb\nis much less than 1.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nOSCILLATIONS 357\n\nOf course, as expected, if we put b = 0, all\nequations of a damped oscillator in this section\nreduce to the corresponding equations of an\nundamped oscillator.\n\nu Example 14.10   For the damped oscillator\nshown in Fig. 14.19, the mass m of the block\nis 200 g, k = 90 N m–1 and the damping\nconstant b is 40 g s–1. Calculate (a) the\nperiod of oscillation, (b) time taken for its\namplitude of vibrations to drop to half of\nits initial value, and (c) the time taken for\nits mechanical energy to drop to half its\ninitial value.\n\nAnswer (a) We see that km = 90×0.2 = 18 kg N\n\nm–1 = kg2 s–2; therefore km = 4.243 kg s\n–1, and\n\nb = 0.04 kg s–1. Therefore, b is much less than\n\nkm . Hence, the time period T from Eq. (14.34)\n\nis given by\n\n2\nm\n\nT  \nk\n\nπ=\n\n   –1\n0.2 kg\n\n2\n90 N m\n\nπ=  \n\n   =  0.3 s\n\n(b) Now, from Eq. (14.33), the time, T\n1/2\n\n, for the\namplitude to drop to half of its initial value is\ngiven by,\n\nln(1/2)\n\n/2\nT    =\n\n1/2\n\nb m\n\n             \n0.6 39\n\n2 200 s\n40\n\n = × ×\n\n             = 6.93 s\n\n(c) For calculating the time, t\n1/2\n\n, for its\nmechanical energy to drop to half its initial value\nwe make use of Eq. (14.35). From this equation\nwe have,\n\nE (t\n1/2\n\n)/E (0)   =  exp (–bt\n1/2\n\n/m)\n\nOr                  ½   =  exp (–bt\n1/2\n\n/m)\n\n              ln (1/2)  =  –(bt\n1/2\n\n/m)\n\nOr  t\n1/2\n\n  \n–1\n\n0.6 39\n200 g\n\n40 g s\n    \n\n \n= ×\n\n              =  3.46 s\nThis is just half of the decay period for\n\namplitude. This is not surprising, because,\naccording to Eqs. (14.33) and (14.35), energy\ndepends on the square of the  amplitude. Notice\nthat there is a factor of 2 in the exponents of\nthe two exponentials. t\n\n14.10 FORCED OSCILLATIONS\nAND RESONANCE\n\nWhen a system (such as a simple pendulum or\n\na block attached to a spring) is displaced from\n\nits equilibrium position and released, it oscillates\n\nwith its natural frequency ω, and the oscillations\nare called free oscillations. All free oscillations\neventually die out because of the ever present\n\ndamping forces. However, an external agency\n\ncan maintain these oscillations. These are called\n\nforced or driven oscillations. We consider the\ncase when the external force is itself periodic,\n\nwith a frequency ω\nd\n called the driven frequency.\n\nThe most important fact of forced periodic\n\noscillations is that the system oscillates not with\n\nits natural frequency ω, but at the frequency ω\nd\n\nof the external agency; the free oscillations die\n\nout due to damping. The most familiar example\n\nof forced oscillation is when a child in a garden\n\nswing periodically presses his feet against the\n\nground (or someone else periodically gives the\n\nchild a push) to maintain the oscillations.\nSuppose an external force F(t ) of amplitude\n\nF\n0\n that varies periodically with time is applied\n\nto a damped oscillator. Such a force can be\nrepresented as,\n\nF(t )  = F\no\n cos ω\n\nd \nt (14.36)\n\nThe motion of a particle under the combined\naction of a linear restoring force, damping force\nand a time dependent driving force represented\nby Eq. (14.36) is given by,\n\nm a(t ) = –k x(t ) – bv(t ) + F\no\n cos ω\n\nd \nt    (14.37a)\n\nSubstituting d2x/dt2 for acceleration in\nEq. (14.37a) and rearranging it, we get\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS358\n\n2\n\n2\n\nd d\ndd\n\nx xm b kx \ntt\n\n+ + =  F\no\n cos ω\n\nd \nt (14.37b)\n\nThis is the equation of an oscillator of mass\nm on which a periodic force of (angular)\nfrequency ω\n\nd \nis applied. The oscillator, initially,\n\noscillates with its natural frequency ω. When\nwe apply the external periodic force, the\noscillations with the natural frequency die out,\nand then the body oscillates with the (angular)\nfrequency of the external periodic force. Its\ndisplacement, after the natural oscillations die\nout, is given by\n\nx(t )  =  A cos (ω\nd\nt  + φ ) (14.38)\n\nwhere t is the time measured from the moment\nwhen we apply the periodic force.\n\nThe amplitude A is a function of the forced\nfrequency ω\n\nd\n and the natural frequency ω.\n\nAnalysis shows that it is given by\n\n( ){ }2d d\n1/2\n\nF\nA\n\nm b\n\nο\n\nω ω ω2 2 2 2 2\n=\n\n− + (14.39a)\n\nand tan φ =\n–v\n\nx\nd\n\nο\n\nοω\n(14.39b)\n\nwhere m is the mass of the particle and v\n0\n and\n\nx\n0\n are the velocity and the displacement of the\n\nparticle at time t = 0, which is the moment when\nwe apply the periodic force. Equation (14.39)\nshows that the amplitude of the forced oscillator\ndepends on the (angular) frequency of the\ndriving force. We can see a different behaviour\nof the oscillator when ω\n\nd\n is far from ω and when\n\nit is close to ω. We consider these two cases.\n(a) Small Damping, Driving Frequency far\nfrom Natural Frequency : In this case, ω\n\nd \nb will\n\nbe much smaller than m(ω2\n \n–ω2\n\nd\n), and we can\n\nneglect that term. Then Eq. (14.39) reduces to\n\nA\nF\n\nm d\n=\n\n−( )\nο\n\nω ω\n2   2\n\n(14.40)\n\nFig. 14.21 shows the dependence of the\ndisplacement amplitude of an oscillator on the\nangular frequency of the driving force for\ndifferent amounts of damping present in the\nsystem. It may be noted that in all cases the\namplitude is the greatest when ω\n\nd \n/ω = 1. The\n\ncurves in this figure show that smaller the\ndamping, the taller and narrower is the\nresonance peak.\n\nIf we go on changing the driving frequency,\nthe amplitude tends to infinity when it equals\nthe natural frequency. But this is the ideal case\nof zero damping, a case which never arises in a\nreal system as the damping is never perfectly\nzero. You must have experienced in a swing that\nwhen the timing of your push exactly matches\nwith the time period of the swing, your swing\ngets the maximum amplitude. This amplitude\nis large, but not infinity, because there is always\nsome damping in your swing. This will become\nclear in the (b).\n(b) Driving Frequency Close to Natural\n\nFrequency : If ω\nd \n is very close to ω\n\n \n, m (ω2\n\n \n– 2\n\ndω )\nwould be much less than ω\n\nd \nb, for any reasonable\n\nvalue of b, then Eq. (14.39) reduces to\n\nF\nA\n\nο\n\nω\n=\n\nd\nb\n\n(14.41)\n\nThis makes it clear that the maximum\npossible amplitude for a given driving frequency\nis governed by the driving frequency and the\ndamping, and is never infinity. The phenomenon\nof increase in amplitude when the driving force\nis close to the natural frequency of the oscillator\nis called resonance.\n\nIn our daily life, we encounter phenomena\nwhich involve resonance.  Your experience with\n\nb=70g/s\n\nb=140g/s\n\nb=50g/s (least \n\n damping)\n\nFig. 14.21 The displacement amplitude of a forced\noscillator as a function of the angular\nfrequency of the driving force. The\n\namplitude is the greatest at ω\nd \n/ω =1, the\n\nresonance condition. The three curves\ncorrespond to different extents of damping\n\npresent in the system. The curves 1 and\n\n3 correspond to minimum and maximum\ndamping in the system.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nOSCILLATIONS 359\n\nmotion is gradually damped and not sustained.\nTheir frequencies of oscillation gradually\nchange, and ultimately, they oscillate with the\nfrequency of pendulum 1, i.e., the frequency of\nthe driving force but with different amplitudes.\nThey oscillate with small amplitudes. The\nresponse of pendulum 4 is in contrast to this\nset of pendulums. It oscillates with the same\nfrequency as that of pendulum 1 and its\namplitude gradually picks up and becomes very\nlarge. A resonance-like response is seen.\nThis happens because in this the condition for\nresonance is satisfied, i.e. the natural frequency\nof the system coincides with that of the\ndriving force.\n\nWe have so far considered oscillating systems\n\nwhich have just one natural frequency. In\ngeneral, a system may have several natural\n\nfrequencies. You will see examples of such\nsystems (vibrating strings, air columns, etc.) in\nthe next chapter. Any mechanical structure, like\n\na building, a bridge, or an aircraft may have\nseveral possible natural frequencies. An\n\nexternal periodic force or disturbance will set\nthe system in forced oscillation. If, accidentally,\n\nthe forced frequency ω\nd\n happens to be close to\n\none of the natural frequencies of the system,\nthe amplitude of oscillation will shoot up\n\n(resonance), resulting in possible damage. This\nis why, soldiers go out of step while crossing a\n\nbridge. For the same reason, an earthquake will\nnot cause uniform damage to all buildings in\nan affected area, even if they are built with the\n\nsame strength and material. The natural\nfrequencies of a building depend on its height,\n\nother size parameters, and the nature of\nbuilding material. The one with its natural\nfrequency close to the frequency of seismic wave\n\nis likely to be damaged more.\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. The motion that repeats itself is called periodic motion.\n\n2. The period T is the time required for one complete oscillation, or cycle. It is  related to\nthe frequency ν by,\n\nν\n1\n  T =\n\nswings is a good example of resonance. You\nmight have realised that the skill in swinging to\ngreater heights lies in the synchronisation of\nthe rhythm of pushing against the ground with\nthe natural frequency of the swing.\n\nTo illustrate this point further, let us\nconsider a set of five simple pendulums of\nassorted lengths suspended from a common rope\nas shown in Fig. 14.22. The pendulums 1 and 4\nhave the same lengths and the others have\ndifferent lengths. Now, let us set pendulum 1\ninto motion. The energy from this pendulum gets\ntransferred to other pendulums through  the\nconnecting rope and they start oscillating. The\ndriving force is provided through the connecting\nrope. The frequency of this force is the frequency\nwith which pendulum 1 oscillates.  If we observe\nthe response of pendulums 2, 3 and 5, they first\nstart oscillating with their natural frequencies\nof oscillations and different amplitudes, but this\n\nFig. 14.22 Five simple pendulums of different\nlengths suspended from a common\n\nsupport.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS360\n\nThe frequency ν of periodic or oscillatory motion is the number of oscillations per\nunit time. In the SI, it is measured in hertz :\n\n                      1 hertz = 1 Hz = 1 oscillation per second = 1s–1\n\n3. In simple harmonic motion (SHM), the displacement x (t) of a particle from its\nequilibrium position is given by,\n\nx (t)  = A cos (ωt + φ ) (displacement),\n\nin which A\n \n is the amplitude of the displacement, the quantity  (ωt + φ ) is the phase of\n\nthe motion, and φ is the phase constant. The angular frequency ω is related to the\nperiod and frequency of the motion by,\n\n                         \n2\n\n2    \nT\n\nπ\nω πν= = (angular frequency).\n\n4. Simple harmonic motion can also be viewed as the projection of uniform circular\nmotion on the diameter of the circle in which the latter motion occurs.\n\n5. The particle velocity and acceleration during SHM as functions of time are given by,\n\nv (t)  =  –ωA sin (ωt + φ )            (velocity),\n\n                        a (t)  =  –ω2A cos (ωt + φ )\n\n                                = –ω2x (t)                            (acceleration),\n\nThus we see that both velocity and acceleration of a body executing simple harmonic\nmotion are periodic functions, having the velocity amplitude v\n\nm\n=ω A  and acceleration\n\namplitude a\nm \n\n=ω 2A, respectively.\n\n6. The force acting in a simple harmonic motion is proportional to the displacement and\nis always directed towards the centre of motion.\n\n7. A particle executing simple harmonic motion has, at any time, kinetic energy\nK = ½ mv2  and potential energy U = ½ kx2.  If no friction is present the mechanical\nenergy of the system, E = K + U always remains constant even though K and U change\nwith time.\n\n8. A particle of mass m oscillating under the influence of Hooke’s law restoring force\ngiven by F = – k x exhibits simple harmonic motion with\n\nω \nk\n\nm\n= (angular frequency)\n\n2\nm\n\nT \nk\n\nπ= (period)\n\nSuch a system is also called a linear oscillator.\n\n9. The motion of a simple pendulum swinging through small angles is approximately\nsimple harmonic. The period of oscillation is given by,\n\n2\nL\n\nT \ng\n\nπ=\n\n10. The mechanical energy in a real oscillating system decreases during oscillations because\nexternal forces, such as drag, inhibit the oscillations and transfer mechanical energy\nto thermal energy. The real oscillator and its motion are then said to be damped. If the\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nOSCILLATIONS 361\n\ndamping force is given by F\nd\n = –bv, where v is the velocity of the oscillator and b is a\n\ndamping constant, then the displacement of the oscillator is given by,\n\n                                     x (t) = A\n \ne–bt/2m cos (ω′t + φ )\n\nwhere ω′, the angular frequency of the damped oscillator, is given by\n\n                                   \n\n2\n\n2\n \n\n4\n\nbk\n   \n\nm m\nω ′ = −\n\nIf the damping constant is small then ω′ ≈ ω, where ω is the angular frequency of the\nundamped oscillator. The mechanical energy E of the damped oscillator is given by\n\n                                    /\n1\n\n2\n2 bt m\n\nE(t) kA e\n−=\n\n11. If an external force with angular frequency ω\nd\n acts on an oscillating system with natural\n\nangular frequency ω, the system oscillates with angular frequency ω\nd\n. The amplitude of\n\noscillations is the greatest when\n\n                                    ω\nd\n  =  ω\n\na condition called resonance.\n\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n\n1. The period T is the least time after which motion repeats itself.  Thus, motion repeats\nitself after nT where n is an integer.\n\n2. Every periodic motion is not simple harmonic motion. Only that periodic motion\ngoverned by the force law F = – k x is simple harmonic.\n\n3. Circular motion can arise due to an inverse-square law force (as in planetary motion)\nas well as due to simple harmonic force in two dimensions equal to: –mω2r.  In the\nlatter case, the phases of motion, in two perpendicular directions (x and y) must differ\n\nby π/2. Thus, for example, a particle subject to a force  –mω2r with initial position (0,\nA) and velocity (ωA, 0) will move uniformly in a circle of radius A.\n\n4. For linear simple harmonic motion with a given ω, two initial conditions are necessary\nand sufficient to determine the motion completely.  The  initial  conditions may be (i)\ninitial position and initial velocity or (ii) amplitude and phase or (iii) energy\nand phase.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS362\n\n5. From point 4 above, given  amplitude or energy, phase of motion is determined by the\ninitial position or initial velocity.\n\n6. A combination of two simple harmonic motions with arbitrary amplitudes and phases\nis not necessarily periodic.  It is periodic only if frequency of one motion is an integral\nmultiple of the other’s frequency.  However, a periodic motion can always be expressed\nas a sum of infinite number of harmonic motions with appropriate amplitudes.\n\n7. The period of SHM does not depend on amplitude or energy or the phase constant.\nContrast this with the periods of planetary orbits under gravitation (Kepler’s third\nlaw).\n\n8. The motion of a simple pendulum is simple harmonic for small angular displacement.\n\n9. For motion of a particle to be simple harmonic, its displacement x must be expressible\nin either of the following forms :\n\nx = A cos ωt  +  B sin ωt\n\nx = A cos (ωt + α ), x =  B sin (ωt + β )\n\nThe three forms are completely equivalent (any one can be expressed in terms of any\nother two forms).\n\nThus, damped simple harmonic motion [Eq. (14.31)] is not strictly simple harmonic. It\nis approximately so only for time intervals much less than 2m/b where b is the damping\nconstant.\n\n10. In forced oscillations, the steady state motion of the particle (after the forced oscillations\ndie out) is simple harmonic motion whose frequency is the frequency of the driving\nfrequency ω\n\nd\n, not the natural frequency ω of the particle.\n\n11. In the ideal case of zero damping, the amplitude of simple harmonic motion at resonance\nis infinite. Since all real systems have some damping, however small, this situation is\nnever observed.\n\n12. Under forced oscillation, the phase of harmonic motion of the particle differs from the\nphase of the driving force.\n\nExercises\n\n14.1 Which of the following examples represent periodic motion?\n(a) A swimmer completing one (return) trip from one bank of a river to the other\n\nand back.\n(b) A freely suspended bar magnet displaced from its N-S direction and released.\n(c) A hydrogen molecule rotating about its centre of mass.\n(d) An arrow released from a bow.\n\n14.2 Which of the following examples represent (nearly) simple harmonic motion and\nwhich represent periodic but not simple harmonic motion?\n(a) the rotation of earth about its axis.\n(b) motion of an oscillating mercury column in a U-tube.\n(c) motion of a ball bearing inside a smooth curved bowl, when released from a\n\npoint slightly above the lower most point.\n(d) general vibrations of a polyatomic molecule about its equilibrium position.\n\n14.3 Fig. 14.23 depicts four x-t plots for linear motion of a particle.

What happens in a system, which is\n\na collection of such objects? A material medium provides\n\nsuch an example. Here, elastic forces bind the constituents\n\nto each other and, therefore, the motion of one affects that of\n\nthe other. If you drop a little pebble in a pond of still water,\n\nthe water surface gets disturbed. The disturbance does not\n\nremain confined to one place, but propagates outward along\n\na circle. If you continue dropping pebbles in the pond, you\n\nsee circles rapidly moving outward from the point where the\n\nwater surface is disturbed. It gives a feeling as if the water is\n\nmoving outward from the point of disturbance. If you put\n\nsome cork pieces on the disturbed surface, it is seen that\n\nthe cork pieces move up and down but do not move away\n\nfrom the centre of disturbance. This shows that the water\n\nmass does not flow outward with the circles, but rather a\n\nmoving disturbance is created. Similarly, when we speak,\n\nthe sound moves outward from us, without any flow of air\n\nfrom one part of the medium to another. The disturbances\n\nproduced in air are much less obvious and only our ears or\n\na microphone can detect them. These patterns, which move\n\nwithout the actual physical transfer or flow of matter as a\n\nwhole, are called waves. In this Chapter, we will study such\nwaves.\n\nWaves transport energy and the pattern of disturbance has\ninformation that propagate from one point to another. All our\ncommunications essentially depend on transmission of sig-\nnals through waves. Speech means production of sound\nwaves in air and hearing amounts to their detection. Often,\ncommunication involves different kinds of waves. For exam-\nple, sound waves may be first converted into an electric cur-\nrent signal which in turn may generate an electromagnetic\nwave that may be transmitted by an optical cable or via a\n\n15.1 Introduction\n\n15.2 Transverse and\nlongitudinal waves\n\n15.3 Displacement relation in a\nprogressive wave\n\n15.4 The speed of a travelling\nwave\n\n15.5 The principle of\nsuperposition of waves\n\n15.6 Reflection of waves\n\n15.7 Beats\n\n15.8 Doppler effect\n\nSummary\n\nPoints to ponder\n\nExercises\n\nAdditional exercises\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS368\n\nsatellite. Detection of the original signal will usu-\nally involve these steps in reverse order.\n\nNot all waves require a medium for their\n\npropagation. We know that light waves can\n\ntravel through vacuum. The light emitted by\n\nstars, which are hundreds of light years away,\n\nreaches us through inter-stellar space, which\n\nis practically a vacuum.\nThe most familiar type of waves such as waves\n\non a string, water waves, sound waves, seismic\nwaves, etc. is the so-called mechanical waves.\nThese waves require a medium for propagation,\nthey cannot propagate through vacuum. They\ninvolve oscillations of constituent particles and\ndepend on the elastic properties of the medium.\nThe electromagnetic waves that you will learn\nin Class XII are a different type of wave.\nElectromagnetic waves do not necessarily require\na medium - they can travel through vacuum.\nLight, radiowaves, X-rays, are all electromagnetic\nwaves. In vacuum, all electromagnetic waves\nhave the same speed c, whose value is :\n\nc = 299, 792, 458 ms–1. (15.1)\n\nA third kind of wave is the so-called Matter\nwaves. They are associated with constituents of\nmatter : electrons, protons, neutrons, atoms and\nmolecules. They arise in quantum mechanical\ndescription of nature that you will learn in your\nlater studies. Though conceptually more abstract\nthan mechanical or electro-magnetic waves, they\nhave already found applications in several\ndevices basic to modern technology; matter\nwaves associated with electrons are employed\n\nin electron microscopes.\n\nIn this chapter we will study mechanical\n\nwaves, which require a material medium for\n\ntheir propagation.\n\nThe aesthetic influence of waves on art and\n\nliterature is seen from very early times; yet the\n\nfirst scientific analysis of wave motion dates back\nto the seventeenth century. Some of the famous\nscientists associated with the physics of wave\nmotion are Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695),\nRobert Hooke and Isaac Newton. The\nunderstanding of physics of waves followed the\nphysics of oscillations of masses tied to springs\nand physics of the simple pendulum. Waves in\nelastic media are intimately connected with\nharmonic oscillations. (Stretched strings, coiled\nsprings, air, etc., are examples of elastic media).\n\nWe shall illustrate this connection through\nsimple examples.\n\nConsider a collection of springs connected to\none another as shown in Fig. 15.1. If the spring\nat one end is pulled suddenly and released, the\ndisturbance travels to the other end. What has\n\nhappened? The first spring is disturbed from its\nequilibrium length. Since the second spring is\nconnected to the first, it is also stretched or\ncompressed, and so on. The disturbance moves\nfrom one end to the other; but each spring only\nexecutes small oscillations about its equilibrium\nposition. As a practical example of this situation,\nconsider a stationary train at a railway station.\nDifferent bogies of the train are coupled to each\nother through a spring coupling. When an\nengine is attached at one end, it gives a push to\nthe bogie next to it; this push is transmitted from\none bogie to another without the entire train\nbeing bodily displaced.\n\nNow let us consider the propagation of sound\n\nwaves in air. As the wave passes through air, it\n\ncompresses or expands a small region of air. This\n\ncauses a change in the density of that region,\n\nsay δρ, this change induces a change in pressure,\nδp, in that region. Pressure is force per unit area,\nso there is a restoring force proportional to\nthe disturbance, just like in a spring. In this\n\ncase, the quantity similar to extension or\n\ncompression of the spring is the change in\n\ndensity. If a region is compressed, the molecules\n\nin that region are packed together, and they tend\nto move out to the adjoining region, thereby\n\nincreasing the density or creating compression\n\nin the adjoining region. Consequently, the air\n\nin the first region undergoes rarefaction. If a\nregion is comparatively rarefied the surrounding\nair will rush in making the rarefaction move to\nthe adjoining region. Thus, the compression or\nrarefaction moves from one region to another,\nmaking the propagation of a disturbance\npossible in air.\n\nFig. 15.1 A collection of springs connected to each\nother. The end A is pulled suddenly\n\ngenerating a disturbance, which then\n\npropagates to the other end.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nWAVES 369\n\nIn solids, similar arguments can be made. In\na crystalline solid, atoms or group of atoms are\narranged in a periodic lattice. In these, each\natom or group of atoms is in equilibrium, due to\nforces from the surrounding atoms. Displacing\none atom, keeping the others fixed, leads to\nrestoring forces, exactly as in a spring. So we\ncan think of atoms in a lattice as end points,\nwith springs between pairs of them.\n\nIn the subsequent sections of this chapter\nwe are going to discuss various characteristic\nproperties of waves.\n\n15.2 TRANSVERSE AND LONGITUDINAL\nWAVES\n\nWe have seen that motion of mechanical waves\ninvolves oscillations of constituents of the\nmedium. If the constituents of the medium\noscillate perpendicular to the direction of wave\npropagation, we call the wave a transverse wave.\nIf they oscillate along the direction of wave\npropagation, we call the wave a longitudinal\nwave.\n\nFig.15.2 shows the propagation of a single\npulse along a string, resulting from a single up\nand down jerk. If the string is very long compared\n\nposition as the pulse or wave passes through\nthem. The oscillations are normal to the\ndirection of wave motion along the string, so this\nis an example of transverse wave.\n\nWe can look at a wave in two ways. We can fix\nan instant of time and picture the wave in space.\nThis will give us the shape of the wave as a\nwhole in space at a given instant. Another way\nis to fix a location i.e. fix our attention on a\nparticular element of string and see its\noscillatory motion in time.\n\nFig. 15.4 describes the situation for\nlongitudinal waves in the most familiar example\nof the propagation of sound waves. A long pipe\nfilled with air has a piston at one end. A single\nsudden push forward and pull back of the piston\nwill generate a pulse of condensations (higher\ndensity) and rarefactions (lower density) in the\nmedium (air). If the  push-pull of the piston is\ncontinuous and periodic (sinusoidal), a\n\nFig. 15.3 A harmonic (sinusoidal) wave travelling\nalong a stretched string is an example of a\ntransverse wave. An element of the string\nin the region of the wave oscillates about\nits equilibrium position perpendicular to the\ndirection of wave propagation.\n\nFig. 15.2 When a pulse travels along the length of a\nstretched string (x-direction), the elements\n\nof the string oscillate up and down (y-\n\ndirection)\n\nto the size of the pulse, the pulse will damp out\nbefore it reaches the other end and reflection\nfrom that end may be ignored. Fig. 15.3 shows a\nsimilar situation, but this time the external\nagent gives a continuous periodic sinusoidal up\nand down jerk to one end of the string. The\nresulting disturbance on the string is then a\nsinusoidal wave. In either case the elements of\nthe string oscillate about their equilibrium mean\n\nFig. 15.4 Longitudinal waves (sound) generated in a\npipe filled with air by moving the piston up\n\nand down. A volume element of air oscillates\n\nin the direction parallel to the direction of\n\nwave propagation.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS370\n\nsinusoidal wave will be generated propagating\nin air along the length of the pipe. This is clearly\nan example of longitudinal waves.\n\nThe waves considered above, transverse or\n\nlongitudinal, are travelling or progressive waves\n\nsince they travel from one part of the medium\n\nto another. The material medium as a whole\n\ndoes not move, as already noted. A stream, for\n\nexample, constitutes motion of water as a whole.\n\nIn a water wave, it is the disturbance that moves,\n\nnot water as a whole. Likewise a wind (motion\n\nof air as a whole) should not be confused with a\n\nsound wave which is a propagation of\n\ndisturbance (in pressure density) in air, without\n\nthe motion of air medium as a whole.\n\nIn transverse waves, the particle motion is\n\nnormal to the direction of propagation of the\n\nwave. Therefore, as the wave propagates, each\n\nelement of the medium undergoes a shearing\n\nstrain. Transverse waves can, therefore, be\n\npropagated only in those media, which can\n\nsustain shearing stress, such as solids and not\n\nin fluids. Fluids, as well as, solids can sustain\n\ncompressive strain; therefore, longitudinal\n\nwaves can be propagated in all elastic media.\n\nFor example, in medium like steel, both\n\ntransverse and longitudinal waves can\n\npropagate, while air can sustain only\n\nlongitudinal waves. The waves on the surface\n\nof water are of two kinds: capillary waves and\n\ngravity waves. The former are ripples of fairly\n\nshort wavelength—not more than a few\n\ncentimetre—and the restoring force that\n\nproduces them is the surface tension of water.\n\nGravity waves have wavelengths typically\n\nranging from several metres to several hundred\n\nmeters. The restoring force that produces these\n\nwaves is the pull of gravity, which tends to keep\n\nthe water surface at its lowest level. The\n\noscillations of the particles in these waves are\n\nnot confined to the surface only, but extend with\n\ndiminishing amplitude to the very bottom. The\n\nparticle motion in water waves involves a\n\ncomplicated motion—they not only move up and\n\ndown but also back and forth. The waves in an\n\nocean are the combination of both longitudinal\n\nand transverse waves.\n\nIt is found that, generally, transverse and\nlongitudinal waves travel with different speed\nin the same medium.\n\nuuuuu Example 15.1  Given below are some\nexamples of wave motion.

Such a function at every instant should\ngive the shape of the wave at that instant. Also,\nat every given location, it should describe the\nmotion of the constituent of the medium at that\nlocation. If we wish to describe a sinusoidal\ntravelling wave (such as the one shown in Fig.\n15.3) the corresponding function must also be\nsinusoidal. For convenience, we shall take the\nwave to be transverse so that if the position of\nthe constituents of the medium is denoted by x,\nthe displacement from the equilibrium position\nmay be denoted by y. A sinusoidal travelling\nwave is then described by:\n\n( , ) sin( )= − ω + φy x t a kx t (15.2)\nThe term φ in the argument of sine function\n\nmeans equivalently that we are considering a\nlinear combination of sine and cosine functions:\n\n( , ) sin( ) cos( )y x t A kx t B kx tω ω= − + − (15.3)\nFrom Equations (15.2) and (15.3),\n\n2 2\na A B= +  and  \n\n1tanφ −=\nB\n\nA\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\nTo understand why Equation (15.2)\nrepresents a sinusoidal travelling wave, take a\nfixed instant,  say t = t\n\n0\n. Then, the argument of\n\nthe sine function in Equation (15.2) is simply\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nWAVES 371\n\nkx + constant. Thus, the shape of the wave (at\n\nany fixed instant) as a function of x  is a sine\nwave. Similarly, take a fixed location, say x = x\n\n0\n.\n\nThen, the argument of the sine function in\nEquation (15.2) is constant -ωt. The\ndisplacement y, at a fixed location, thus, varies\nsinusoidally with time. That is, the constituents\nof the medium at different positions execute\nsimple harmonic motion. Finally, as t increases,\nx must increase in the positive direction to keep\nkx – ωt + φ  constant. Thus, Eq. (15.2) represents\na sinusiodal (harmonic) wave travelling along\nthe positive direction of the x-axis. On the other\nhand, a function\n\n( , ) sin( )= + ω + φy x t a kx t  (15.4)\nrepresents a wave travelling in the negative\ndirection of x-axis. Fig. (15.5) gives the names of\nthe various physical quantities appearing in Eq.\n(15.2) that we now interpret.\n\n    Fig. 15.6 shows the plots of Eq. (15.2) for\ndifferent values of time differing by equal\nintervals of time. In a wave, the crest is the\npoint of maximum positive displacement, the\ntrough is the point of maximum negative\ndisplacement. To see how a wave travels, we\ncan fix attention on a crest and see how it\nprogresses with time. In the figure, this is\nshown by a cross (×) on the crest. In the same\nmanner, we can see the motion of a particular\nconstituent of the medium at a fixed location,\nsay at the origin of the x-axis. This is shown\nby a solid dot (•). The plots of Fig. 15.6 show\nthat with time, the solid dot (•) at the origin\nmoves periodically, i.e., the particle at the\norigin oscillates about its mean position as\nthe wave progresses. This is true for any other\nlocation also. We also see that during the time\nthe solid dot (•) has completed one full\noscillation, the crest has moved further by a\ncertain distance.\n\nUsing the plots of Fig. 15.6, we now define\nthe various quantities of Eq. (15.2).\n\n15.3.1  Amplitude and Phase\n\nIn Eq. (15.2), since the sine function varies\n\nbetween 1 and –1, the displacement y (x,t) varies\n\nbetween a and –a. We can take a to be a positive\n\nconstant, without any loss of generality. Then,\n\na represents the maximum displacement of the\n\nconstituents of the medium from their\n\nequilibrium position. Note that the displacement\n\ny may be positive or negative, but a is positive.\n\nIt is called the amplitude of the wave.\n\nThe quantity (kx – ωt + φ) appearing as the\nargument of the sine function in Eq. (15.2) is\n\ncalled the phase of the wave. Given the\n\namplitude a, the phase determines the\n\ndisplacement of the wave at any position and\n\nat any instant. Clearly φ is the phase at x = 0\nand t = 0. Hence, φ is called the initial phase\nangle. By suitable choice of origin on the x-axis\n\nand the intial time, it is possible to have φ = 0.\nThus there is no loss of generality in dropping\n\nφ, i.e., in taking Eq. (15.2) with φ = 0.\n\nFig. 15.5 The meaning of standard symbols in\nEq.

For simplicity,\nwe can choose points of the same phase to be\n\ncrests or troughs. The wavelength is then the\n\ndistance between two consecutive crests or\n\ntroughs in a wave. Taking  φ = 0 in Eq. (15.2),\nthe displacement at  t = 0 is given by\n\n( , 0) sin=y x a kx      (15.5)\n\nSince the sine function repeats its value after\nevery 2π change in angle,\n\nsin sin( ) sinkx kx n k x\nn\n\nk\n= + = +\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n2\n2\n\nπ\nπ\n\nThat is the displacements at points x and at\n\n2n\nx\n\nk\n\nπ\n+\n\nare the same, where n=1,2,3,...

It\n\ndescribes not the shape of the wave at a certain\n\ninstant but the displacement of an element (at\n\nany fixed location) of the medium as a function\n\nof time. We may for, simplicity, take Eq. (15.2)\n\nwith φ = 0 and monitor the motion of the element\nsay at 0x = . We then get\n\n(0, ) sin( )y t a tω= −\n\n   sina tω= −\n\nNow, the period of oscillation of the wave is the\ntime it takes for an element to complete one full\noscillation. That is\n\nsin sin ( T)a t a tω ω− = − +\n   sin( T)a tω ω= − +\n\nSince sine function repeats after every 2π ,\n\nT 2ω π=   or   \n2\n\nT\n\nπ\nω = (15.7)\n\nω  is called the angular frequency of the wave.\nIts SI unit is rad s –1.

In a longitudinal wave, the\n\ndisplacement of an element of the medium is\n\nparallel to the direction of propagation of the\n\nwave. In Eq. (15.2), the displacement function\n\nfor a longitudinal wave is written as,\n\ns(x, t) = a sin (kx – ωt + φ) (15.9)\n\nwhere s(x, t ) is the displacement of an element\nof the medium in the direction of propagation\nof the wave at position x and time t. In Eq. (15.9),\na\n\n \nis the displacement amplitude; other\n\nquantities have the same meaning as in case\nof a transverse wave except that the\ndisplacement function y (x, t ) is to be replaced\nby the function s (x, t ).\n\n* Here again, ‘radian’ could be dropped and the units could be written merely as m–1. Thus, k represents 2π\ntimes the number of waves (or the total phase difference) that can be accommodated per unit length, with SI\n\nunits m–1.\n\nFig. 15.7 An element of a string at a fixed location\n\noscillates in time with amplitude a and\n\nperiod T, as the wave passes over it.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nWAVES 373\n\nuuuuu Example 15.2  A wave travelling along a\nstring is described by,\n\ny(x, t) = 0.005 sin (80.0 x – 3.0 t),\n\nin which the numerical constants are in\nSI units (0.005 m, 80.0 rad m–1, and\n3.0 rad s–1). Calculate (a) the amplitude,\n(b) the wavelength, and (c) the period and\nfrequency of the wave. Also, calculate the\ndisplacement y of the wave at a distance\nx = 30.0 cm and time t = 20 s ?\n\nAnswer  On comparing this displacement\nequation with Eq.

It is convenient to look at the\n\nmotion of the crest of the wave. Fig. 15.8 gives\nthe shape of the wave at two instants of time,\nwhich differ by a small time internal ∆t. The\nentire wave pattern is seen to shift to the right\n(positive direction of x-axis) by a distance ∆x. In\nparticular, the crest shown by a dot (• ) moves a\n\ndistance ∆x in time ∆t. The speed of the wave is\nthen ∆x/∆t. We can put the dot (• ) on a point\nwith any other phase. It will move with the same\nspeed v (otherwise the wave pattern will not\nremain fixed). The motion of a fixed phase point\non the wave is given by\n\nkx – ωt = constant (15.10)\n\nThus, as time t changes, the position x of the\nfixed phase point must change so that the phase\nremains constant. Thus,\n\nkx – ωt = k(x+∆x) – ω(t+∆t)\n\nor k ∆x – ω ∆t =0\n\nTaking ∆x, ∆t vanishingly small, this gives\n\nω \n= =\n\nd\n\n dx\nv\n\nt k\n(15.11)\n\nRelating ω to T and k to λ, we get\n\n2\n\n2 /\n\nπν λ\nλν\n\nπ λ\n= = =v\n\nT\n(15.12)\n\nEq. (15.12), a general relation for all\nprogressive waves, shows that in the time\nrequired for one full oscillation by any\nconstituent of the medium, the wave pattern\ntravels a distance equal to the wavelength of the\nwave. It should be noted that the speed of a\nmechanical wave is determined by the inertial\n(linear mass density for strings, mass density\n\nFig. 15.8 Progression of a harmonic wave from time\n\nt  to t + ∆t. where ∆t is a small interval.\nThe wave pattern as a whole shifts to the\n\nright.

The medium\ndetermines the speed; Eq. (15.12) then relates\nwavelength to frequency for the given speed. Of\ncourse, as remarked earlier, the medium can\nsupport both transverse and longitudinal waves,\nwhich will have different speeds in the same\nmedium. Later in this chapter, we shall obtain\nspecific expressions for the speed of mechanical\nwaves in some media.\n\n15.4.1 Speed of a Transverse Wave on\nStretched String\n\nThe speed of a mechanical wave is determined\nby the restoring force setup in the medium when\nit is disturbed and the inertial properties (mass\ndensity) of the medium. The speed is expected to\nbe directly related to the former and inversely to\nthe latter. For waves on a string, the restoring\nforce is provided by the tension T in the string.\nThe inertial property will in this case be linear\nmass density µ, which is mass m  of the string\ndivided by its length L. Using Newton’s Laws of\nMotion, an exact formula for the wave speed on\na string can be derived, but this derivation is\noutside the scope of this book. We shall,\ntherefore, use dimensional analysis. We already\nknow that dimensional analysis alone can never\nyield the exact formula. The overall\ndimensionless constant is always left\nundetermined by dimensional analysis.\n\nThe dimension of µ is [ML–1] and that of T is\nlike force, namely [MLT–2]. We need to combine\nthese dimensions to get the dimension of speed\nv [LT–1]. Simple inspection shows that the\nquantity T/µ has the relevant dimension\n\nMLT\n\nML\nL T\n\n−\n\n−\n−\n\n\uf8ee\uf8f0 \uf8f9\uf8fb\n\uf8ee\uf8f0 \uf8f9\uf8fb\n\n= \uf8ee\uf8f0 \uf8f9\uf8fb\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2 2\n\nThus if T and µ are assumed to be the only\nrelevant physical quantities,\n\nv  = C \nT\n\nµ\n(15.13)\n\nwhere C is the undetermined constant of\ndimensional analysis. In the exact formula, it\nturms out, C=1. The speed of transverse waves\non a stretched string is given by\n\nv  = \nµ\nT\n\n  \n(15.14)\n\nNote the important point that the speed v\ndepends only on the properties of the medium T\nand µ (T is a property of the stretched string\narising due to an external force). It does not\ndepend on wavelength or frequency of the wave\nitself. In higher studies, you will come across\nwaves whose speed is not independent of\nfrequency of the wave. Of the two parameters λ\nand ν the source of disturbance determines the\nfrequency of the wave generated. Given the\n\nPropagation of a pulse on a rope\nYou can easily see the motion of a pulse on a rope. You can also see\nits reflection from a rigid boundary and measure its velocity of travel.\nYou will need a rope of diameter 1 to 3 cm, two hooks and some\nweights. You can perform this experiment in your classroom or\nlaboratory.\n\nTake a long rope or thick string of diameter 1 to 3 cm, and tie it to\nhooks on opposite walls in a hall or laboratory. Let one end pass on\na hook and hang some weight (about 1 to 5 kg) to it. The walls may\nbe about 3 to 5 m apart.\n\nTake a stick or a rod and strike the rope hard at a point near one\nend. This creates a pulse on the rope which now travels on it. You\ncan see it reaching the end and reflecting back from it. You can\ncheck the phase relation between the incident pulse and reflected\npulse. You can easily watch two or three reflections before the pulse\ndies out. You can take a stopwatch and find the time for the pulse\nto travel the distance between the walls, and thus measure its\n\nvelocity. Compare it with that obtained from Eq. (15.14).\nThis is also what happens with a thin metallic string of a musical instrument. The major difference is\n\nthat the velocity on a string is fairly high because of low mass per unit length, as compared to that on a\nthick rope. The low velocity on a rope allows us to watch the motion and  make measurements beautifully.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nWAVES 375\n\nspeed of the wave in the medium and the\nfrequency Eq.

We have\nalready seen that the sound waves travel in the\nform of compressions and rarefactions of small\nvolume elements of air.  The elastic property that\ndetermines the stress under compressional\nstrain is the bulk modulus of the medium defined\nby (see Chapter 9)\n\nP\nB  \n\nV/V\n\n∆\n= −\n\n∆\n(15.16)\n\nHere, the change in pressure ∆P produces a\n\nvolumetric strain \nV\n\nV\n\n∆\n. B has the same dimension\n\nas pressure and given in SI units in terms of\npascal (Pa). The inertial property relevant for the\npropagation of wave is the mass density ρ, with\ndimensions [ML–3]. Simple inspection reveals\nthat quantity B/ρ has the relevant dimension:\n\n(15.17)\n\nThus, if B and ρ  are considered to be the only\nrelevant physical quantities,\n\nv  = C \nB\n\nρ\n(15.18)\n\nwhere, as before, C is the undetermined constant\nfrom dimensional analysis. The exact derivation\nshows that C=1. Thus, the general formula for\nlongitudinal waves in a medium is:\n\nv  = \nB\n\nρ\n(15.19)\n\nFor a linear medium, like a solid bar, the\nlateral expansion of the bar is negligible and we\nmay consider it to be only under longitudinal\nstrain. In that case, the relevant modulus of\nelasticity is Young’s modulus, which has the\nsame dimension as the Bulk modulus.\nDimensional analysis for this case is the same\nas before and yields a relation like Eq. (15.18),\nwith an undetermined C, which the exact\nderivation shows to be unity. Thus, the speed of\nlongitudinal waves in a solid bar is given by\n\n v  = \nρ\nY\n\n(15.20)\n\nwhere Y is the Young’s modulus of the material\nof the bar. Table 15.1 gives the speed of sound\nin some media.\n\nTable 15.1 Speed of Sound in some Media\n\n   Liquids and solids generally have higher speed\nof sound than gases. [Note for solids, the speed\nbeing referred to is the speed of longitudinal\nwaves in the solid]. This happens because they\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS376\n\nare much more difficult to compress than gases\nand so have much higher values of bulk modulus.\nNow, see Eq. (15.19). Solids and liquids have\n\nhigher mass densities ( ρ ) than gases. But the\ncorresponding increase in both the modulus (B)\nof solids and liquids is much higher. This is the\nreason why the sound waves travel faster in\nsolids and liquids.\n\nWe can estimate the speed of sound in a gas\nin the ideal gas approximation. For an ideal gas,\nthe pressure P, volume V and temperature T are\nrelated by (see Chapter 11).\n\nPV = Nk\nB\nT (15.21)\n\nwhere N is the number of molecules in volume\nV, k\n\nB\n is the Boltzmann constant and T the\n\ntemperature of the gas (in Kelvin). Therefore, for\nan isothermal change it follows from Eq.(15.21)\nthat\n\nV∆P + P∆V  = 0\n\nor P\nV/V\n\nP\n =\n\n∆\n∆\n\n−\n\nHence, substituting in Eq. (15.16), we have\n\nB = P\n\nTherefore, from Eq. (15.19) the speed of a\nlongitudinal wave in an ideal gas is given by,\n\nv  = \nρ\nP\n\n(15.22)\n\nThis relation was first given by Newton and\nis known as Newton’s formula.\n\nuuuuu Example 15.4  Estimate the speed of\nsound in air at standard temperature and\npressure.

Where\ndid we go wrong ? If we examine the basic\nassumption made by Newton that the pressure\nvariations in a medium during propagation of\nsound are isothermal, we find that this is not\ncorrect. It was pointed out by Laplace that the\npressure variations in the propagation of sound\nwaves are so fast that there is little time for the\nheat flow to maintain constant temperature.\nThese variations, therefore, are adiabatic and\nnot isothermal. For adiabatic processes the ideal\ngas satisfies the relation (see Section 12.8),\n\nPV\nγ\n  = constant\n\ni.e. ∆(PV γ )  = 0\nor P γ V γ –1 ∆V + V γ ∆P = 0\nwhere γ is the ratio of two specific heats,\nC\n\np\n/C\n\nv\n.\n\nThus, for an ideal gas the adiabatic bulk\nmodulus is given by,\n\nB\nad\n\n = \nV/V\n\nP\n \n∆\n\n∆\n−\n\n  =  γP\n   The speed of sound is, therefore, from Eq.\n(15.19), given by,\n\nv = \nρ\n\nγ P \n(15.24)\n\nThis modification of Newton’s formula is referred\nto as the Laplace correction. For air\nγ = 7/5. Now using Eq. (15.24) to estimate the speed\nof sound in air at STP, we get a value 331.3 m s–1,\nwhich agrees with the measured speed.\n\n15.5 THE PRINCIPLE OF SUPERPOSITION\nOF WAVES\n\nWhat happens when two wave pulses travelling\n\nin opposite directions cross each other\n\n(Fig. 15.9)? It turns out that wave pulses\n\ncontinue to retain their identities after they have\n\ncrossed. However, during the time they overlap,\n\nthe wave pattern is different from either of the\n\npulses. Figure 15.9 shows the situation when\n\ntwo pulses of equal and opposite shapes move\n\ntowards each other. When the pulses overlap,\n\nthe resultant displacement is the algebraic sum\n\nof the displacement due to each pulse. This is\n\nknown as the principle of superposition of waves.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nWAVES 377\n\nAccording to this principle, each pulse moves\nas if others are not present. The constituents of\nthe medium, therefore, suffer displacments due\nto both and since the displacements can be\npositive and negative, the net displacement is\nan algebraic sum of the two. Fig. 15.9 gives\ngraphs of the wave shape at different times. Note\nthe dramatic effect in the graph (c); the\ndisplacements due to the two pulses have exactly\ncancelled each other and there is zero\ndisplacement throughout.\n    To put the principle of superposition\nmathematically, let y\n\n1\n (x,t) and y\n\n2\n (x,t) be the\n\ndisplacements due to two wave disturbances in\nthe medium. If the waves arrive in a region\nsimultaneously, and therefore, overlap, the net\ndisplacement y (x,t) is given by\n\ny     (x, t ) =  y\n1\n(x, t ) +  y\n\n2\n(x, t ) (15.25)\n\nIf we have two or more waves moving in the\nmedium the resultant waveform is the sum of\nwave functions of individual waves. That is, if\nthe wave functions of the moving waves are\n\ny\n1\n = f\n\n1\n(x–vt),\n\ny\n2\n = f\n\n2\n(x–vt),\n\n..........\n\n           ..........\n\n           y\nn\n = f\n\nn\n (x–vt)\n\nthen the wave funct ion descr ib ing the\ndisturbance in the medium is\n\ny = f\n1\n(x – vt)+ f\n\n2\n(x – vt)+  ...+ f\n\nn\n(x – vt)\n\n   ( )\n=1i\n\nn\n f  x vt\n\ni\n= −∑ (15.26)\n\nThe principle of superposition is basic to the\nphenomenon of interference.\n\nFor simplicity, consider two harmonic\ntravelling waves on a stretched string, both with\nthe same ω (angular frequency) and k (wave\nnumber), and, therefore, the same wavelength\nλ. Their wave speed will be identical. Let us\nfurther assume that their amplitudes are equal\nand they are both travelling in the positive\ndirection of x-axis. The waves only differ in their\ninitial phase. According to Eq. (15.2), the two\nwaves are described by the functions:\n\ny\n1\n(x, t) = a sin (kx – ωt) (15.27)\n\nand y\n2\n(x, t) =  a sin (kx – ωt + φ ) (15.28)\n\nThe net displacement is then, by the principle\nof superposition, given by\n\ny  (x, t ) = a sin (kx – ωt) + a sin (kx – ωt + φ )\n(15.29)\n\n( ) ( )\n2sin cos\n\n2 2\n\nkx t kx t\na\n\nω ω φ φ\uf8ee \uf8f9− + − +\uf8ee \uf8f9\n= \uf8ef \uf8fa\uf8ef \uf8fa\n\n\uf8ef \uf8fa\uf8f0 \uf8fb\uf8f0 \uf8fb\n(15.30)\n\nwhere we have used the familiar trignometric\n\nidentity for sin sinA B+ . We then have\n\n( ), 2 cos sin\n2 2\n\ny x t a kx t\nφ φ\n\nω\uf8eb \uf8f6= − +\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ed \uf8f8\n\n(15.31)\n\nEq. (15.31) is also a harmonic travelling wave in\nthe positive direction of x-axis, with the same\nfrequency and wavelength. However, its initial\n\nphase angle is \n2\n\nφ\n. The significant thing is that\n\nits amplitude is a function of the phase difference\nφ between the constituent two waves:\n\nA(φ)  =  2a cos ½φ (15.32)\nFor φ = 0, when the waves are in phase,\n\n( ) ( ), 2 siny x t a kx tω= − (15.33)\ni.e., the resultant wave has amplitude 2a, the\n\nlargest possible value for A. For φ π= , the\n\nFig. 15.9 Two pulses having equal and opposite\ndisplacements moving in opposite\n\ndirections. The overlapping pulses add up\n\nto zero displacement in curve (c).\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS378\n\nreflected. The phenomenon of echo is an example\nof reflection by a rigid boundary. If the boundary\nis not completely rigid or is an interface between\ntwo different elastic media, the situation is some\nwhat complicated. A part of the incident wave is\nreflected and a part is transmitted into the\nsecond medium. If a wave is incident obliquely\non the boundary between two different media\nthe transmitted wave is called the refracted\nwave. The incident and refracted waves obey\nSnell’s law of refraction, and the incident and\nreflected waves obey the usual laws of\nreflection.\n\nFig. 15.11 shows a pulse travelling along a\nstretched string and being reflected by the\nboundary. Assuming there is no absorption of\nenergy by the boundary, the reflected wave has\nthe same shape as the incident pulse but it\nsuffers a phase change of π or 1800 on reflection.\nThis is because the boundary is rigid and the\ndisturbance must have zero displacement at all\ntimes at the boundary. By the principle of\nsuperposition, this is possible only if the reflected\nand incident waves differ by a phase of π, so that\nthe resultant displacement is zero. This\nreasoning is based on boundary condition on a\nrigid wall. We can arrive at the same conclusion\ndynamically also. As the pulse arrives at the wall,\nit exerts a force on the wall. By Newton’s Third\nLaw, the wall exerts an equal and opposite force\non the string generating a reflected pulse that\ndiffers by a phase of π.\n\nFig. 15.11 Reflection of a pulse meeting a rigid boundary.\n\nFig. 15.10 The resultant of two harmonic waves of\nequal amplitude and wavelength\n\naccording to the principle of superposition.\n\nThe amplitude of the resultant wave\n\ndepends on the phase difference φ, which\nis zero  for (a) and π for (b)\n\nwaves are completely, out of phase and the\nresultant wave has zero displacement\neverywhere at all times\n\ny   (x, t )  = 0 (15.34)\nEq. (15.33) refers to the so-called constructive\ninterference of the two waves\nwhere the amplitudes add up in\nthe resultant wave. Eq. (15.34)\nis the case of destructive\nintereference where the\namplitudes subtract out in the\nresultant wave. Fig. 15.10\nshows these two cases of\ninterference of waves arising\nfrom the principle of\nsuperposition.\n\n15.6 REFLECTION OF\nWAVES\n\nSo far we considered waves\npropagating in an unbounded\nmedium. What happens if a\npulse or a wave meets a\nboundary? If the boundary is\nrigid, the pulse or wave gets\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nWAVES 379\n\nIf on the other hand, the boundary point is\nnot rigid but completely free to move (such as in\nthe case of a string tied to a freely moving ring\non a rod), the reflected pulse has the same phase\nand amplitude (assuming no energy dissipation)\nas the incident pulse. The net maximum\ndisplacement at the boundary is then twice the\namplitude of each pulse. An example of non- rigid\nboundary is the open end of an organ pipe.\n\nTo summarise, a travelling wave or pulse\nsuffers a phase change of π on reflection at a\nrigid boundary and no phase change on\nreflection at an open boundary. To put this\nmathematically, let the incident travelling wave\nbe\n\n( ) ( )2 , sin ω= −y x t a kx t\nAt a rigid boundary, the reflected wave is given\nby\n\ny\nr\n(x, t) = a sin (kx – ωt + π).\n\n   = – a sin (kx – ωt ) (15.35)\nAt an open boundary, the reflected wave is given\nby\n\ny\nr\n(x, t ) = a sin (kx – ωt + 0).\n\n   = a sin (kx – ωt ) (15.36)\n\nClearly, at the rigid boundary, \n2\n\n0= + =\nr\n\ny y y\n\nat all times.\n\n15.6.1   Standing Waves and Normal Modes\n\nWe considered above reflection at one boundary.\nBut there are familiar situations (a string fixed\nat either end or an air column in a pipe with\neither end closed) in which reflection takes place\nat two or more boundaries. In a string, for\nexample, a wave travelling in one direction will\nget reflected at one end, which in turn will travel\nand get reflected from the other end. This will\ngo on until there is a steady wave pattern set\nup on the string. Such wave patterns are called\nstanding waves or stationary waves. To see this\nmathematically, consider a wave travelling\nalong the positive direction of x-axis and a\nreflected wave of the same amplitude and\nwavelength in the negative direction of x-axis.\nFrom Eqs. (15.2) and (15.4), with φ = 0, we get:\n\ny\n1\n(x, t ) = a sin (kx – ωt )\n\ny\n2\n(x, t ) = a sin (kx + ωt )\n\nThe resultant wave on the string is, according\nto the principle of superposition:\n\ny (x, t) =  y\n1\n(x, t ) + y\n\n2\n(x, t )\n\n= a [sin (kx – ωt) + sin (kx + ωt)]\n\nUsing the familiar trignometric identity\nSin (A+B) + Sin (A–B) = 2 sin A cosB we get,\n\ny (x, t ) = 2a sin kx cos ωt (15.37)\n\nNote the important difference in the wave\npattern described by Eq. (15.37) from that\ndescribed by Eq. (15.2) or Eq. (15.4). The terms\nkx and ωt appear separately, not in the\ncombination kx - ωt. The amplitude of this wave\nis 2a sin kx. Thus, in this wave pattern, the\namplitude varies from point-to-point, but each\nelement of the string oscillates with the same\nangular frequency ω or time period. There is no\nphase difference between oscillations of different\nelements of the wave. The string as a whole\nvibrates in phase with differing amplitudes at\ndifferent points. The wave pattern is neither\nmoving to the right nor to the left. Hence, they\nare called standing or stationary waves. The\namplitude is fixed at a given location but, as\nremarked earlier, it is different at different\nlocations. The points at which the amplitude is\nzero (i.e., where there is no motion at all) are\nnodes; the points at which the amplitude is the\nlargest are called antinodes. Fig. 15.12 shows\na stationary wave pattern resulting from\nsuperposition of two travelling waves in\nopposite directions.\n\nThe most significant feature of stationary\nwaves is that the boundary conditions constrain\nthe possible wavelengths or frequencies of\nvibration of the system. The system cannot\noscillate with any arbitrary frequency (contrast\nthis with a harmonic travelling wave), but is\ncharacterised by a set of natural frequencies or\nnormal modes of oscillation. Let us determine\nthese normal modes for a stretched string fixed\nat both ends.\n\nFirst, from Eq. (15.37), the positions of nodes\n(where the amplitude is zero) are given by\nsin kx = 0 .\nwhich implies\n\nkx = nπ;   n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nSince, k = 2π/λ , we get\n\nx = \nλ\n\n2\n\nn\n ; n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...        (15.38)\n\nClearly, the distance between any two\n\nsuccessive nodes is \nλ\n2\n\n. \nIn the same way, the\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS380\n\npositions of antinodes (where the amplitude is\nthe largest) are given by the largest value of sin\nkx :\n\n\uf8efsin kx\n \n\uf8ef= 1\n\nwhich implies\n\nkx = (n + ½) π ; n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nWith k = 2π/λ, we get\n\n x = (n + ½)\n2\n\nλ\n ; n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...                (15.39)\n\nAgain the distance between any two consecutive\n\nantinodes is \n2\n\nλ\n. Eq. (15.38) can be applied to\n\nthe case of a stretched string of length L fixed\nat both ends. Taking one end to be at x = 0, the\nboundary conditions are that x = 0 and x = L\nare positions of nodes. The x = 0 condition is\nalready satisfied. The x = L node condition\nrequires that the length L is related to λ by\n\nL = n \n2\n\nλ\n;     n = 1, 2, 3, ...      (15.40)\n\nThus, the possible wavelengths of stationary\nwaves are constrained by the relation\n\nλ  = 2L\n\nn\n;    n = 1, 2, 3, … (15.41)\n\nwith corresponding frequencies\n\nv =  \n2L\n\nnv\n, for  n = 1, 2, 3, (15.42)\n\nWe have thus obtained the natural frequencies\n- the normal modes of oscillation of the system.\nThe lowest possible natural frequency of a\nsystem is called its fundamental mode or the\nfirst harmonic. For the stretched string fixed\n\nat either end it is given by v = \nv\n\nL2\n, corresponding\n\nto n = 1 of Eq. (15.42). Here v is the speed of\nwave determined by the properties of the\nmedium. The n = 2 frequency is called the\nsecond harmonic; n = 3 is the third harmonic\n\nFig. 15.12 Stationary waves arising from superposition of two harmonic waves travelling in opposite directions.\nNote that the positions of zero displacement (nodes) remain fixed at all times.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nWAVES 381\n\nand so on. We can label the various\nharmonics by the symbol ν\n\nn\n ( n = 1,\n\n2, ...).\n\nFig. 15.13 shows the first six\n\nharmonics of a stretched string\n\nfixed at either end. A string need not\nvibrate in one of these modes only.\n\nGenerally, the vibration of a string\n\nwill be a superposition of different\n\nmodes; some modes may be more\n\nstrongly excited and some less.\n\nMusical instruments like sitar or\nviolin are based on this principle.\n\nWhere the string is plucked or\n\nbowed, determines which modes are\n\nmore prominent than others.\n\nLet us next consider normal\n\nmodes of oscillation of an air column\nwith one end closed and the other\n\nopen. A glass tube partially filled\n\nwith water illustrates this system.\n\nThe end in contact with water is a\n\nnode, while the open end is an\n\nantinode. At the node the pressure\nchanges are the largest, while the\n\ndisplacement is minimum (zero). At\n\nthe open end - the antinode, it is\n\njust the other way - least pressure\n\nchange and maximum amplitude of\n\ndisplacement. Taking the end in\ncontact with water to be x = 0, the\n\nnode condition (Eq. 15.38) is already\n\nsatisfied. If the other end x = L is an\n\nantinode, Eq. (15.39) gives\n\nL =   n +\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n1\n\n2\n \n2\n\nλ\n, for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, …\n\nThe possible wavelengths are then restricted by\nthe relation :\n\nλ  = \n( )\n\n2\n\n1 2\n\nL\n\nn  + /\n,  for n = 0, 1, 2, 3,...

(15.44)\n\nThe fundamental frequency corresponds to n = 0,\n\nand is given by \nv\n\nL4\n . The higher frequencies\n\nare odd harmonics, i.e., odd multiples  of the\n\nfundamental frequency : 3\nv\n\nL4\n, 5\n\nv\n\nL4\n, etc.\n\nFig. 15.14 shows the first six odd harmonics of\nair column with one end closed and the other\nopen. For a pipe open at both ends, each end is\nan antinode. It is then easily seen that an open\nair column at both ends generates all harmonics\n(See Fig. 15.15).\n\nThe systems above, strings and air columns,\ncan also undergo forced oscillations (Chapter\n14). If the external frequency is close to one of\nthe natural frequencies, the system shows\nresonance.\n\nFig. 15.13  The first six harmonics of vibrations of a stretched\nstring fixed at both ends.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS382\n\nNormal modes of a circular membrane rigidly\nclamped to the circumference as in a tabla are\ndetermined by the boundary condition that no\npoint on the circumference of the membrane\nvibrates. Estimation of the frequencies of normal\nmodes of this system is more complex. This\nproblem involves wave propagation in two\ndimensions. However, the underlying physics is\nthe same.\n\nuuuuu Example 15.5  A pipe, 30.0 cm long, is\nopen at both ends. Which harmonic mode\nof the pipe resonates a 1.1 kHz source?  Will\nresonance with the same source be\nobserved if one end of the pipe is closed ?\nTake the speed of sound in air as\n330 m s–1.\n\nAnswer  The first harmonic frequency is given\nby\n\n                ν\n1\n = \n\nL\n\nvv\n\n2\n  \n\n1\n=\n\nλ\n     (open pipe)\n\nwhere L is the length of the pipe.

(14.50) that the fundamental\nfrequency is\n\nν\n1\n =  \n\nL\n\nvv\n\n4\n  \n\n1\n=\n\nλ  (pipe closed at one end)\n\nand only the odd numbered harmonics are\npresent :\n\nν\n3\n = \n\n3\n\n4\n\nv\n\nL\n,  ν\n\n5\n = \n\n5\n\n4\n\nv\n\nL\n, and so on.\n\nFor L = 30 cm and v = 330 m s–1, the\nfundamental frequency of the pipe closed at one\nend is 275 Hz and the source frequency\ncorresponds to its fourth harmonic. Since this\nharmonic is not a possible mode, no resonance\nwill be observed with the source, the moment\none end is closed. t\n\n15.7   BEATS\n\n‘Beats’ is an interesting phenomenon arising\nfrom interference of waves.

Artists use this phenomenon often\nwhile tuning their instruments with each other.\nThey go on tuning until their sensitive ears do\nnot detect any beats.\n\nTo see this mathematically, let us consider\ntwo harmonic sound waves of nearly equal\nangular frequency ω\n\n1\n and ω\n\n2\n and fix the location\n\nto be x = 0 for convenience. Eq. (15.2) with a\nsuitable choice of phase (φ = π/2 for each) and,\nassuming equal amplitudes, gives\n s\n\n1\n = a \n\n \ncos ω\n\n1\nt   and  s\n\n2\n = a \n\n \ncos ω\n\n2\nt         (15.45)\n\nHere we have replaced the symbol y by s,\nsince we are referring to longitudinal not\ntransverse displacement.

Vibrations of these pillars depend on\nelasticity of the stone used, its density and\nshape.\n\nMusical pillars are categorised into three\ntypes: The first is called the Shruti Pillar,\nas it can produce the basic notes —  the\n“swaras”. The second type is the Gana\nThoongal, which generates the basic tunes\nthat make up the “ragas”. The third variety\nis the Laya Thoongal pillars that produce\n“taal” (beats) when tapped. The pillars at the\nNellaiappar temple are a combination of the\nShruti and Laya types.\n\nArchaeologists date the Nelliappar\ntemple to the 7th century and claim it was\nbuilt by successive rulers of the Pandyan\ndynasty.\n\nThe musical pillars of Nelliappar and\nseveral other temples in southern India like\nthose at Hampi (picture), Kanyakumari, and\nThiruvananthapuram are unique to the\ncountry and have no parallel in any other\npart of the world.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS384\n\ndecreases as it recedes away. When we\napproach a stationary source of sound with high\nspeed, the pitch of the sound heard appears to\nbe higher than that of the source. As the\nobserver recedes away from the source, the\nobserved pitch (or frequency) becomes lower\nthan that of the source. This motion-related\nfrequency change is called Doppler effect. The\nAustrian physicist Johann Christian Doppler\nfirst proposed the effect in 1842. Buys Ballot in\nHolland tested it experimentally in 1845.\nDoppler effect is a wave phenomenon, it holds\nnot only for sound waves but also for\nelectromagnetic waves. However, here we shall\nconsider only sound waves.\n\nWe shall analyse changes in frequency under\nthree different situations: (1) observer is\n\nReflection of sound in an open\npipe\n\nWhen a high\npressure pulse of\nair travelling down\nan open pipe\nreaches the other\nend, its momentum\ndrags the air out\ninto the open, where\npressure falls\nrapidly to the\na t m o s p h e r i c\npressure. As a\n\nresult the air following after it in the tube is\npushed out. The low pressure at the end of\nthe tube draws air from further up the tube.\nThe air gets drawn towards the open end\nforcing the low pressure region to move\nupwards. As a result a pulse of high pressure\nair travelling down the tube turns into a\npulse of low pressure air travelling up the\ntube. We say a pressure wave has been\nreflected at the open end with a change in\nphase of 1800. Standing waves in an open\npipe organ like the flute is a result of this\nphenomenon.\n\nCompare this with what happens when\na pulse of high pressure air arrives at a\nclosed end: it collides and as a result pushes\nthe air back in the opposite direction. Here,\nwe say that the pressure wave is reflected,\nwith no change in phase.\n\nFig. 15.16 Superposition of two harmonic waves, one\nof frequency 11 Hz (a), and the other of\n\nfrequency 9Hz (b), giving rise to beats of\n\nfrequency 2 Hz, as shown in (c).\n\nω\n2\n.

What is the original\nfrequency of B if the frequency of A is\n427 Hz ?\n\nAnswer Increase in the tension of a string\nincreases its frequency. If the original frequency\nof B (ν\n\nB\n) were greater than that of A (ν\n\nA \n), further\n\nincrease in ν\nB\n should have resulted in an\n\nincrease in the beat frequency. But the beat\nfrequency is found to decrease. This shows that\nν\n\nB\n < ν\n\nA\n. Since ν\n\nA\n – ν\n\nB\n = 5 Hz, and ν\n\nA\n = 427 Hz, we\n\nget ν\nB\n = 422 Hz.       t\n\n15.8    DOPPLER EFFECT\n\nIt is an everyday experience that the pitch (or\nfrequency) of the whistle of a fast moving train\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nWAVES 385\n\nstationary but the source is moving, (2) observer\nis moving but the source is stationary, and (3)\nboth the observer and the source are moving.\nThe situations (1) and (2) differ from each other\nbecause of the absence or presence of relative\nmotion between the observer and the medium.\nMost waves require a medium for their\npropagation; however, electromagnetic waves do\nnot require any medium for propagation. If there\nis no medium present, the Doppler shifts are\nsame irrespective of whether the source moves\nor the observer moves, since there is no way of\ndistinction between the two situations.\n\n15.8.1    Source Moving ; Observer Stationary\n\nLet us choose the convention to take the\ndirection from the observer to the source as\nthe positive direction of velocity. Consider a\nsource S moving with velocity vs and an observer\nwho is stationary in a frame in which the\nmedium is also at rest. Let the speed of a wave\nof angular frequency ω and period To, both\nmeasured by an observer at rest with respect to\nthe medium, be v. We assume that the observer\nhas a detector that counts every time a wave\ncrest reaches it. As shown in\nFig. 15.17, at time t = 0 the source is at point S1,\nlocated at a distance L from the observer,  and\nemits a crest.  This reaches the observer at time\nt1 = L/v. At time t = To the source has moved a\ndistance vsTo and is at point S2, located at a\ndistance (L + vsTo) from the observer. At S2, the\nsource emits a second crest.

He measures a higher\nfrequency when the source approaches him.\n\n15.8.2 Observer Moving; Source\nStationary\n\nNow to derive the Doppler shift when the\nobserver is moving with velocity vo towards the\nsource and the source is at rest, we have to\nproceed in a different manner. We work in the\n\nFig. 15.17 Doppler effect (change in frequency of\nwave) detected when the source is moving\n\nand the observer is at rest in the medium.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS386\n\nreference frame of the moving observer. In this\nreference frame the source and medium are\napproaching at speed vo and the speed with\nwhich the wave approaches is vo + v.

(15.53) and the approximate relation\nEq. (15.51 ) are the same.\n\n15.8.3  Both Source and Observer Moving\n\nWe will now derive a general expression for\nDoppler shift when both the source and the\nobserver are moving. As before, let us take the\ndirection from the observer to the source as the\npositive direction. Let the source and the\nobserver be moving with velocities vs and vo\nrespectively as shown in Fig.15.18. Suppose at\ntime t = 0, the observer is at O1 and the source\nis at S1, O1 being to the left of S1. The source\nemits a wave of velocity v, of frequency v and\nperiod T0 all measured by an observer at rest\n\nwith respect to the medium. Let L be the\n\ndistance between O1 and S1 at t = 0, when the\n\nsource emits the first crest. Now, since the\n\nobserver is moving, the velocity of the wave\n\nrelative to the observer is v +v0.\n \nTherefore, the\n\nfirst crest reaches the observer at time t1 = L/\n\n(v+v0 ). At time t = T0, both the observer and the\n\nsource have moved to their new positions O2 and\n\nS2 respectively. The new distance between the\n\nobserver and the source, O2 S2, would be\n\nL+(vs–v0 ) T0]. At S2, the source emits a\n\nsecond crest.\n\nApplication of Doppler effect\n\nThe change in frequency caused by a moving object\ndue to Doppler effect is used to measure their\nvelocities in diverse areas such as military,\nmedical science, astrophysics, etc. It is also used\nby police to check over-speeding of vehicles.\n\nA sound wave or electromagnetic wave of\nknown frequency is sent towards a moving object.\nSome part of the wave is reflected from the object\nand its frequency is detected by the monitoring\nstation. This change in frequency is called Doppler\nshift.\n\nIt is used at airports to guide aircraft, and in\nthe military to detect enemy aircraft.\nAstrophysicists use it to measure the velocities\nof stars.\n\nDoctors use it to study heart beats and blood\nflow in different parts of the body. Here they use\nulltrasonic waves, and in common practice, it is\ncalled sonography. Ultrasonic waves enter the\nbody of the person, some of them are reflected\nback, and give information about motion of blood\nand pulsation of heart valves, as well as pulsation\nof the heart of the foetus. In the case of heart,\nthe picture generated is called echocardiogram.\n\nFig. 15.18 Doppler effect when both the source and\nobserver are moving with different\n\nvelocities.\n\nThis reaches the observer at time.\n\nt2 = To + [L + (vs – vo)To )] /(v + vo)\n\nAt time nTo the source emits its (n+1) th crest\nand this reaches the observer at time\n\ntn+1 = nTo + [L + n (vs – vo)To)] /(v + vo )\n\nHence, in a time interval tn+1 –t1, i.e.,\n\nnTo + [L + n (vs – vo)To)] /(v + vo ) – L /(v + vo ),\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nWAVES 387\n\nthe observer counts n crests and the observer\nrecords the period of the wave as equal to T given by\n\n0 0\n\n0 0\n\n-\n  1\n\n  \ns o sv v v vT T T\n\nv v v v\n\n\uf8eb \uf8f6 \uf8eb \uf8f6+\n= + =\uf8ec \uf8f7 \uf8ec \uf8f7\n\n+ +\uf8ed \uf8f8 \uf8ed \uf8f8\n(15.54)\n\nThe frequency v observed by the observer is\ngiven by\n\n(15.55)\n\nConsider a passenger sitting in a train moving\non a straight track. Suppose she hears a whistle\nsounded by the driver of the train.  What\nfrequency will she measure or hear? Here both\nthe observer and the source are moving with\nthe same velocity, so there will be no shift in\nfrequency and the passenger will note the\nnatural frequency. But an observer outside who\nis stationary with respect to the track will note\na higher frequency if the train is approaching\nhim and a lower frequency when it recedes\nfrom him.\n\nNote that we have defined the direction from\nthe observer to the source as the positive\ndirection. Therefore, if the observer is moving\ntowards the source, v0 has a positive (numerical)\nvalue whereas if O is moving away from S, v0\nhas a negative value. On the other hand, if S is\nmoving away from O, vs has a positive value\nwhereas if it is moving towards O, vs has a\nnegative value. The sound emitted by the source\ntravels in all directions. It is that part of sound\ncoming towards the observer which the  observer\nreceives and detects. Therefore, the relative\nvelocity of sound with respect to the observer is\nv + v\n\n0\n in all cases.\n\nuuuuu Example 15.7  A rocket is moving at a\nspeed of 200 m s–1 towards a stationary\ntarget. While moving, it emits a wave of\nfrequency 1000 Hz. Some of the sound\nreaching the target gets reflected back to the\nrocket as an echo. Calculate (1) the\nfrequency of the sound as detected by the\ntarget and (2) the frequency of the echo as\ndetected by the rocket.\n\nAnswer (1) The observer is at rest and the\nsource is moving with a speed of 200 m s–1. Since\nthis is comparable with the velocity of sound,\n330 m s–1, we must use Eq. (15.50) and not the\napproximate Eq. (15.51). Since the source is\napproaching a stationary target, v\n\no\n = 0, and v\n\ns\n\nmust be replaced by –v\ns\n.\n \nThus, we have\n\n1\n\n1\n\n−\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n\uf8eb\n−=\n\nv\ns\n\nv\n  0vv\n\n v = 1000 Hz × [1 – 200 m s–1/330 m s–1]–1\n\n     j  2540 Hz\n\n(2) The target is now the source (because it is\nthe source of echo) and the rocket’s detector is\nnow the detector or observer (because it detects\necho). Thus, v\n\ns\n = 0 and v\n\no\n has a positive value.\n\nThe frequency of the sound emitted by the source\n(the target) is v, the frequency intercepted by\nthe target and not v\n\no\n. Therefore, the frequency\n\nas registered by the rocket is\n\nv′ = 0 \nv v\n\nv\n\n+\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ed \uf8f8\n\nv \n\nj 4080 Hz  t\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS388\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. Mechanical waves can exist in material media and are governed by Newton’s Laws.\n\n2. Transverse waves are waves in which the particles of the medium oscillate perpendicular\nto the direction of wave propagation.\n\n3. Longitudinal waves are waves in which the particles of the medium oscillate along the\ndirection of wave propagation.\n\n4. Progressive wave is a wave that moves from one point of medium to another.\n\n5. The displacement in a sinusoidal wave propagating in the positive x direction is given\nby\n\ny (x, t) = a sin (kx – ωt + φ)\nwhere a is the amplitude of the wave, k is the angular wave number, ω is the angular\nfrequency, (kx – ωt + φ) is the phase, and φ is the phase constant or phase angle.\n\n6. Wavelength λ of a progressive wave is the distance between two consecutive points of\nthe same phase at a given time. In a stationary wave, it is twice the distance between\ntwo  consecutive nodes or antinodes.\n\n7. Period T of oscillation of a wave is defined as the time any element of the medium\ntakes to move through one complete oscillation. It is related to the angular frequency ω\nthrough the relation\n\nT =\n2π\n\nω\n\n8. Frequency v of a wave is defined as 1/T and is related to angular frequency by\n\n2\n\nω\nν =\n\nπ\n\n9. Speed of a progressive wave is given by \nk T\n\nv\nω λ\n\nλν= = =\n\n10.  The speed of a transverse wave on a stretched string is set by the properties of the\nstring. The speed on a string with tension T and linear mass density µ is\n\nv =\nT\n\nµ\n\n11. Sound waves are longitudinal mechanical waves that can travel through solids, liquids,\nor gases. The speed v of sound wave in a fluid having bulk modulus B and density ρ is\n\nv\nB\n\n=\nρ\n\nThe speed of longitudinal waves in a metallic bar is\n\nv\nY\n\n=\nρ\n\nFor  gases,  since B = γP, the speed of sound is\n\nv\nP\n\n=\nγ\n\nρ\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nWAVES 389\n\n12. When two or more waves traverse simultaneously in the same medium, the\ndisplacement of any element of the medium is the algebraic sum of the displacements\ndue to each wave. This is known as the principle of superposition of waves\n\n1\n\n(   )\nn\n\ni\n\ni\n\ny f x vt\n=\n\n= −∑\n\n13. Two sinusoidal waves on the same string exhibit interference, adding or cancelling\naccording to the principle of superposition. If the two are travelling in the same\ndirection and have the same amplitude a and frequency but differ in phase by a phase\nconstant φ, the result is a single wave with the same frequency ω :\n\ny     (x, t)  = 2\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\na kxcos sinφ ω φ\n\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\uf8ef\n\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb\uf8fa\n\n− +\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\n t \n\nIf φ = 0 or an integral multiple of 2π, the waves are exactly in phase and the interference\nis constructive; if φ = π, they are exactly out of phase and the interference is destructive.\n\n14. A travelling wave, at a rigid boundary or a closed end, is reflected with a phase reversal\nbut the reflection at an open boundary takes place without any phase change.\n\nFor an incident wave\n\n                           y\ni \n(x, t) = a sin (kx – ωt )\n\nthe reflected wave at a rigid boundary is\n\n                         y\nr \n(x, t) = – a sin (kx + ωt )\n\nFor reflection at an open boundary\n\n                       y\nr \n(x,t ) = a sin (kx + ωt)\n\n15. The interference of two identical waves moving in opposite directions produces standing\nwaves. For a string with fixed ends, the standing wave is given by\n\ny (x, t) = [2a sin kx ] cos ωt\n\nStanding waves are characterised by fixed locations of zero displacement called nodes\nand fixed locations of maximum displacements called antinodes. The separation between\ntwo consecutive nodes or antinodes is λ/2.\nA stretched string of length L fixed at both the ends vibrates with frequencies given by\n\nv  ,\n2\n\n=\nn v\n\nL\n     n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nThe set of frequencies given by the above relation are called the normal modes of\noscillation of the system. The oscillation mode with lowest frequency is called the\nfundamental mode or the first harmonic. The second harmonic is the oscillation mode\nwith n = 2 and so on.\n\nA pipe of length L with one end closed and other end open (such as air columns)\nvibrates with frequencies given by\n\nv ( )n ½  \n2L\n\nv\n= + ,       n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nThe set of frequencies represented by the above relation are the normal modes of\noscillation of such a system. The lowest frequency given by v/4L is the fundamental\nmode or the first harmonic.\n\n16. A string of length L fixed at both ends or an air column closed at one end and open at\nthe other end or open at both the ends, vibrates with certain frequencies called their\nnormal modes. Each of these frequencies is a resonant frequency of the system.\n\n17. Beats arise when two waves having slightly different frequencies, ν\n1\n and ν\n\n2\n and\n\ncomparable amplitudes, are superposed. The beat frequency is\n\nν\nbeat\n\n = ν\n1\n ~ ν\n\n2\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHYSICS390\n\n18. The Doppler effect is a change in the observed frequency of a wave when the source (S)\nor  the observer (O) or both move(s) relative to the medium. For sound the observed\nfrequency ν is given in terms of the source frequency ν\n\no\n by\n\nv = v\no\n \n\n0\n\n \ns\n\nv v\n\nv v\n\n\uf8eb \uf8f6+\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ec \uf8f7+\n\uf8ed \uf8f8\n\nhere v is the speed of sound through the medium, v\no\n is the velocity of observer relative\n\nto the medium, and v\ns\n is the source velocity relative to the medium. In using this\n\nformula, velocities in the direction OS should be treated as positive and those opposite\nto it should be taken to be negative.\n\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n\n1. A wave is not motion of matter as a whole in a medium.  A wind is different from the\nsound wave in air.  The former involves motion of air from one place to the other.  The\nlatter involves compressions and rarefactions of layers of air.\n\n2. In a wave, energy and not the matter is transferred from one point to the other.\n\n3. In a mechanical wave, energy transfer takes place because of the coupling through\nelastic forces between neighbouring oscillating parts of the medium.\n\n4. Transverse waves can propagate only in medium with shear modulus of elasticity,\nLongitudinal waves need bulk modulus of elasticity and are therefore, possible in all\nmedia, solids, liquids and gases.\n\n5. In a harmonic progressive wave of a given frequency, all particles have the same\namplitude but different phases at a given instant of time.  In a stationary wave, all\nparticles between two nodes have the same phase at a given instant but have different\namplitudes.\n\n6. Relative to an observer at rest in a medium the speed of a mechanical wave in that\nmedium (v) depends only on elastic and other properties (such as mass density) of\nthe medium. It does not depend on the velocity of the source.\n\n7. For an observer moving with velocity v\no\n relative to the medium, the speed of a wave is\n\nobviously different from v and is given by v ± v\no\n.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nWAVES 391\n\nEXERCISES\n\n15.1 A string of mass 2.50 kg is under a tension of 200 N.
