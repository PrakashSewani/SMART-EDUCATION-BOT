The living world\n\ncomprises an amazing diversity of living organisms. Early man could\n\neasily perceive the difference between inanimate matter and living\n\norganisms. Early man deified some of the inanimate matter (wind, sea,\n\nfire etc.) and some among the animals and plants. A common feature of\n\nall such forms of inanimate and animate objects was the sense of awe\n\nor fear that they evoked. The description of living organisms including\n\nhuman beings began much later in human history. Societies which\n\nindulged in anthropocentric view of biology could register limited\n\nprogress in biological knowledge. Systematic and monumental\n\ndescription of life forms brought in, out of necessity, detailed systems\n\nof identification, nomenclature and classification. The biggest spin off\n\nof such studies was the recognition of the sharing of similarities among\n\nliving organisms both horizontally and vertically. That all present day\n\nliving organisms are related to each other and also to all organisms\n\nthat ever lived on this earth, was a revelation which humbled man and\n\nled to cultural movements for conservation of biodiversity. In the\n\nfollowing chapters of this unit, you will get a description, including\n\nclassification, of animals and plants from a taxonomist’s perspective.\n\nDIVERSITY IN THE LIVING WORLD\n\nChapter 1\n\nThe Living World\n\nChapter 2\n\nBiological Classification\n\nChapter 3\n\nPlant Kingdom\n\nChapter 4\n\nAnimal Kingdom\n\nUNIT 1\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nBorn on 5 July 1904, in Kempten, Germany, ERNST MAYR, the\nHarvard University evolutionary biologist who has been called\n‘The Darwin of the 20th century’, was one of the 100 greatest\nscientists of all time. Mayr joined Harvard’s Faculty of Arts\nand Sciences in 1953 and retired in 1975, assuming the title\nAlexander Agassiz Professor of Zoology Emeritus. Throughout\nhis nearly 80-year career, his research spanned ornithology,\ntaxonomy, zoogeography, evolution, systematics, and the\nhistory and philosophy of biology. He almost single-handedly\nmade the origin of species diversity the central question of\nevolutionary biology that it is today. He also pioneered the\ncurrently accepted definition of a biological species. Mayr was\nawarded the three prizes widely regarded as the triple crown of\nbiology: the Balzan Prize in 1983, the International Prize for\nBiology in 1994, and the Crafoord Prize in 1999. Mayr died at\nthe age of 100 in the year 2004.\n\nErnst Mayr\n(1904 – 2004)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nHow wonderful is the living world ! The wide range of living types is\n\namazing. The extraordinary habitats in which we find living organisms,\n\nbe it cold mountains, deciduous forests, oceans, fresh water lakes, deserts\n\nor hot springs, leave us speechless. The beauty of a galloping horse, of\n\nthe migrating birds, the valley of flowers or the attacking shark evokes\n\nawe and a deep sense of wonder. The ecological conflict and cooperation\n\namong members of a population and among populations of a community\n\nor even the molecular traffic inside a cell make us deeply reflect on – what\n\nindeed is life? This question has two implicit questions within it. The first\n\nis a technical one and seeks answer to what living is as opposed to the\n\nnon-living, and the second is a philosophical one, and seeks answer to\n\nwhat the purpose of life is. As scientists, we shall not attempt answering\n\nthe second question. We will try to reflect on – what is living?\n\n1.1 WHAT IS ‘LIVING’?\n\nWhen we try to define ‘living’, we conventionally look for distinctive\n\ncharacteristics exhibited by living organisms. Growth, reproduction, ability\n\nto sense environment and mount a suitable response come to our mind\n\nimmediately as unique features of living organisms. One can add a few\n\nmore features like metabolism, ability to self-replicate, self-organise,\n\ninteract and emergence to this list. Let us try to understand each of these.\n\nAll living organisms grow. Increase in mass and increase in number\n\nof individuals are twin characteristics of growth. A multicellular organism\n\nTHE LIVING WORLD\n\nCHAPTER  1\n\n1.1 What is ‘Living’?\n\n1.2 Diversity in the\n\nLiving World\n\n1.3 Taxonomic\n\nCategories\n\n1.4 Taxonomical\n\nAids\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n4 BIOLOGY\n\ngrows by cell division. In plants, this growth by cell division occurs\n\ncontinuously throughout their life span. In animals, this growth is seen\n\nonly up to a certain age. However, cell division occurs in certain tissues to\n\nreplace lost cells. Unicellular organisms grow by cell division. One can\n\neasily observe this in in vitro cultures by simply counting the number of\n\ncells under the microscope. In majority of higher animals and plants,\n\ngrowth and reproduction are mutually exclusive events. One must\n\nremember that increase in body mass is considered as growth. Non-living\n\nobjects also grow if we take increase in body mass as a criterion for growth.\n\nMountains, boulders and sand mounds do grow. However, this kind of\n\ngrowth exhibited by non-living objects is by accumulation of material on\n\nthe surface. In living organisms, growth is from inside. Growth, therefore,\n\ncannot be taken as a defining property of living organisms. Conditions\n\nunder which it can be observed in all living organisms have to be explained\n\nand then we understand that it is a characteristic of living systems. A\n\ndead organism does not grow.\n\nReproduction, likewise, is a characteristic of living organisms.\n\nIn multicellular organisms, reproduction refers to the production of\n\nprogeny possessing features more or less similar to those of parents.\n\nInvariably and implicitly we refer to sexual reproduction. Organisms\n\nreproduce by asexual means also. Fungi multiply and spread easily due\n\nto the millions of asexual spores they produce. In lower organisms like\n\nyeast and hydra, we observe budding. In Planaria (flat worms), we observe\n\ntrue regeneration, i.e., a fragmented organism regenerates the lost part of\n\nits body and becomes, a new organism. The fungi, the filamentous algae,\n\nthe protonema of mosses, all easily multiply by fragmentation. When it\n\ncomes to unicellular organisms like bacteria, unicellular algae or Amoeba,\n\nreproduction is synonymous with growth, i.e., increase in number of cells.\n\nWe have already defined growth as equivalent to increase in cell number\n\nor mass. Hence, we notice that in single-celled organisms, we are not very\n\nclear about the usage of these two terms – growth and reproduction.\n\nFurther, there are many organisms which do not reproduce (mules, sterile\n\nworker bees, infertile human couples, etc). Hence, reproduction also cannot\n\nbe an all-inclusive defining characteristic of living organisms. Of course,\n\nno non-living object is capable of reproducing or replicating by itself.\n\nAnother characteristic of life is metabolism. All living organisms\n\nare made of chemicals. These chemicals, small and big, belonging to\n\nvarious classes, sizes, functions, etc., are constantly being made and\n\nchanged into some other biomolecules. These conversions are chemical\n\nreactions or metabolic reactions. There are thousands of metabolic\n\nreactions occurring simultaneously inside all living organisms, be they\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTHE LIVING WORLD 5\n\nunicellular or multicellular. All plants, animals, fungi and microbes exhibit\n\nmetabolism. The sum total of all the chemical reactions occurring in our\n\nbody is metabolism. No non-living object exhibits metabolism. Metabolic\n\nreactions can be demonstrated outside the body in cell-free systems. An\n\nisolated metabolic reaction(s) outside the body of an organism, performed\n\nin a test tube is neither living nor non-living. Hence, while metabolism is\n\na defining feature of all living organisms without exception, isolated\n\nmetabolic reactions in vitro are not living things but surely living reactions.\n\nHence, cellular organisation of the body is the defining feature of\n\nlife forms.\n\nPerhaps, the most obvious and technically complicated feature of all\n\nliving organisms is this ability to sense their surroundings or environment\n\nand respond to these environmental stimuli which could be physical,\n\nchemical or biological. We sense our environment through our sense\n\norgans. Plants respond to external factors like light, water,  temperature,\n\nother organisms, pollutants, etc. All organisms, from the prokaryotes to\n\nthe most complex eukaryotes can sense and respond to environmental\n\ncues. Photoperiod affects reproduction in seasonal breeders, both plants\n\nand animals. All organisms handle chemicals entering their bodies. All\n\norganisms therefore, are ‘aware’ of their surroundings. Human being is\n\nthe only organism who is aware of himself, i.e., has self-consciousness.\n\nConsciousness therefore, becomes the defining property of living\n\norganisms.\n\nWhen it comes to human beings, it is all the more difficult to define\n\nthe living state. We observe patients lying in coma in hospitals virtually\n\nsupported by machines which replace heart and lungs. The patient is\n\notherwise brain-dead. The patient has no self-consciousness. Are such\n\npatients who never come back to normal life, living or non-living?\n\nIn higher classes, you will come to know that all living phenomena\n\nare due to underlying interactions. Properties of tissues are not present\n\nin the constituent cells but arise as a result of interactions among the\n\nconstituent cells. Similarly, properties of cellular organelles are not present\n\nin the molecular constituents of the organelle but arise as a result of\n\ninteractions among the molecular components comprising the organelle.\n\nThese interactions result in emergent properties at a higher level of\n\norganisation. This phenomenon is true in the hierarchy of organisational\n\ncomplexity at all levels. Therefore, we can say that living organisms are\n\nself-replicating, evolving and self-regulating interactive systems capable\n\nof responding to external stimuli. Biology is the story of life on earth.\n\nBiology is the story of evolution of living organisms on earth. All living\n\norganisms – present, past and future, are linked to one another by the\n\nsharing of the common genetic material, but to varying degrees.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n6 BIOLOGY\n\n1.2 DIVERSITY IN THE LIVING WORLD\n\nIf you look around you will see a large variety of living organisms, be it\n\npotted plants, insects, birds, your pets or other animals and plants. There\n\nare also several organisms that you cannot see with your naked eye but\n\nthey are all around you. If you were to increase the area that you make\n\nobservations in, the range and variety of organisms that you see would\n\nincrease. Obviously, if you were to visit a dense forest, you would probably\n\nsee a much greater number and kinds of living organisms in it. Each\n\ndifferent kind of plant, animal or organism that you see, represents a\n\nspecies. The number of species that are known and described range\n\nbetween 1.7-1.8 million. This refers to biodiversity or the number and\n\ntypes of organisms present on earth. We should remember here that as\n\nwe explore new areas, and even old ones, new organisms are continuously\n\nbeing identified.\n\nAs stated earlier, there are millions of plants and animals in the world;\n\nwe know the plants and animals in our own area by their local names.\n\nThese local names would vary from place to place, even within a country.\n\nProbably you would recognise the confusion that would be created if we\n\ndid not find ways and means to talk to each other, to refer to organisms\n\nwe are talking about.\n\nHence, there is a need to standardise the naming of living organisms\n\nsuch that a particular organism is known by the same name all over the\n\nworld. This process is called nomenclature. Obviously, nomenclature or\n\nnaming is only possible when the organism is described correctly and we\n\nknow to what organism the name is attached to. This is identification.\n\nIn order to facilitate the study, number of scientists have established\n\nprocedures to assign a scientific name to each known organism.  This is\n\nacceptable to biologists all over the world. For plants, scientific names are\n\nbased on agreed principles and criteria, which are provided in International\n\nCode for Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN). You may ask, how  are animals\n\nnamed? Animal taxonomists have evolved International Code of Zoological\n\nNomenclature (ICZN). The scientific names ensure that each organism\n\nhas only one name. Description of any organism should enable the people\n\n(in any part of the world) to arrive at the same name. They also ensure\n\nthat such a name has not been used for any other known organism.\n\nBiologists follow universally accepted principles to provide scientific\n\nnames to known organisms.  Each name has two components – the\n\nGeneric name and the specific epithet. This system of providing a name\n\nwith two components is called Binomial nomenclature. This naming\n\nsystem given by Carolus Linnaeus is being practised by biologists all\n\nover the world. This naming system using a two word format was found\n\nconvenient. Let us take the example of mango to understand the way of\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTHE LIVING WORLD 7\n\nproviding scientific names better. The scientific name of mango is written\n\nas Mangifera indica. Let us see how it is a binomial name.  In this name\n\nMangifera represents the genus while indica, is a particular species, or a\n\nspecific epithet. Other universal rules of nomenclature are as follows:\n\n1. Biological names are generally in Latin and written in italics.\n\nThey are Latinised or derived from Latin irrespective of their\n\norigin.\n\n2. The first word in a biological name represents the genus while\n\nthe second component denotes the specific epithet.\n\n3. Both the words in a biological name, when handwritten, are\n\nseparately underlined, or printed in italics to indicate their Latin\n\norigin.\n\n4. The first word denoting the genus starts with a capital letter\n\nwhile the specific epithet starts with a small letter. It can be\n\nillustrated with the example of Mangifera indica.\n\nName of the author appears after the specific epithet, i.e., at the end of\n\nthe biological name and is written in an abbreviated form, e.g., Mangifera\n\nindica Linn. It indicates that this species was first described by Linnaeus.\n\nSince it is nearly impossible to study all the living organisms, it is\n\nnecessary to devise some means to make this possible. This process is\n\nclassification. Classification is the process by which anything is grouped\n\ninto convenient categories based on some easily observable characters.\n\nFor example, we easily recognise groups such as plants or animals or\n\ndogs, cats or insects. The moment we use any of these terms, we associate\n\ncertain characters with the organism in that group. What image do you\n\nsee when you think of a dog ? Obviously, each one of us will see ‘dogs’\n\nand not ‘cats’. Now, if we were to think of ‘Alsatians’ we know what we are\n\ntalking about. Similarly, suppose we were to say ‘mammals’, you would,\n\nof course, think of animals with external ears and body hair. Likewise, in\n\nplants, if we try to talk of ‘Wheat’, the picture in each of our minds will be\n\nof wheat plants, not of rice or any other plant. Hence, all these - ‘Dogs’,\n\n‘Cats’, ‘Mammals’, ‘Wheat’, ‘Rice’, ‘Plants’, ‘Animals’, etc., are convenient\n\ncategories we use to study organisms. The scientific term for these\n\ncategories is taxa. Here you must recognise that taxa can indicate\n\ncategories at very different levels. ‘Plants’ – also form a taxa. ‘Wheat’ is\n\nalso a taxa. Similarly, ‘animals’, ‘mammals’, ‘dogs’ are all taxa – but you\n\nknow that a dog is a mammal and mammals are animals. Therefore,\n\n‘animals’, ‘mammals’ and ‘dogs’ represent taxa at different levels.\n\nHence, based on characteristics, all living organisms can be classified\n\ninto different taxa. This process of classification is taxonomy. External\n\nand internal structure, along with the structure of cell, development\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n8 BIOLOGY\n\nprocess and ecological information of organisms are essential and form\n\nthe basis of modern taxonomic studies.\n\nHence, characterisation, identification, classification and nomenclature\n\nare the processes that are basic to taxonomy.\n\nTaxonomy is not something new. Human beings have always been\n\ninterested in knowing more and more about the various kinds of\n\norganisms, particularly with reference to their own use. In early days,\n\nhuman beings needed to find sources for their basic needs of food, clothing\n\nand shelter. Hence, the earliest classifications were based on the ‘uses’ of\n\nvarious organisms.\n\nHuman beings were, since long, not only interested in knowing more\n\nabout different kinds of organisms and their diversities, but also the\n\nrelationships among them.  This branch of study was referred to as\n\nsystematics.  The word systematics is derived from the Latin word\n\n‘systema’ which means systematic arrangement of organisms.  Linnaeus\n\nused Systema Naturae as the  title of his publication.  The scope of\n\nsystematics was later enlarged to include identification, nomenclature\n\nand classification. Systematics takes into account evolutionary\n\nrelationships between organisms.\n\n1.3 TAXONOMIC CATEGORIES\n\nClassification is not a single step process but involves hierarchy of steps\n\nin which each step represents a rank or category.  Since the category is a\n\npart of overall taxonomic arrangement, it is called the taxonomic category\n\nand all categories together constitute the taxonomic hierarchy.  Each\n\ncategory, referred to as a unit of classification, in fact, represents a rank\n\nand is commonly termed as taxon (pl.: taxa).\n\nTaxonomic categories and hierarchy can be illustrated by an example.\n\nInsects represent a group of organisms sharing common features like\n\nthree pairs of jointed legs.  It means insects are recognisable concrete\n\nobjects which can be classified, and thus were given a rank or category.\n\nCan you name other such groups of organisms? Remember, groups\n\nrepresent category.  Category further denotes rank.  Each rank or taxon,\n\nin fact, represents a unit of classification. These taxonomic groups/\n\ncategories are distinct biological entities and not merely morphological\n\naggregates.\n\nTaxonomical studies of all known organisms have led to the\n\ndevelopment of common categories such as kingdom, phylum or division\n\n(for plants), class, order, family, genus and species. All organisms,\n\nincluding those in the plant and animal kingdoms have species as the\n\nlowest category. Now the question you may ask is, how to place an\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTHE LIVING WORLD 9\n\norganism in various categories? The basic requirement is the knowledge\n\nof characters of an individual or group of organisms.  This helps in\n\nidentifying similarities and dissimilarities among the individuals of the\n\nsame kind of organisms as well as of other kinds of organisms.\n\n1.3.1 Species\n\nTaxonomic studies consider a group of individual organisms with\n\nfundamental similarities as a species.  One should be able to distinguish\n\none species from the other closely related species based on the distinct\n\nmorphological differences. Let us consider Mangifera indica, Solanum\n\ntuberosum (potato) and Panthera leo (lion). All the three names, indica,\n\ntuberosum and leo, represent the specific epithets,  while the first words\n\nMangifera, Solanum and Panthera are genera and represents another\n\nhigher level of taxon or category. Each genus may have one or more than\n\none specific epithets representing different organisms, but having\n\nmorphological similarities.  For example,  Panthera has another specific\n\nepithet called tigris and Solanum includes species like nigrum and\n\nmelongena. Human beings belong to the species sapiens  which is\n\ngrouped in the genus Homo. The scientific name thus, for human being,\n\nis written as Homo sapiens.\n\n1.3.2 Genus\n\nGenus comprises a group of related species which has more characters\n\nin common in comparison to species of other genera. We can say that\n\ngenera are aggregates of closely related species. For example, potato and\n\nbrinjal are two different species but both belong to the genus Solanum.\n\nLion (Panthera leo), leopard (P. pardus) and tiger (P. tigris) with several\n\ncommon features, are all species of the genus Panthera. This genus differs\n\nfrom another genus Felis which includes cats.\n\n1.3.3 Family\n\nThe next category, Family, has a group of related genera with still less\n\nnumber of similarities as compared to genus and species.   Families are\n\ncharacterised on the basis of both vegetative and reproductive features of\n\nplant species. Among plants for example, three different genera Solanum,\n\nPetunia and Datura are placed in the family Solanaceae. Among animals\n\nfor example, genus Panthera, comprising lion, tiger, leopard is put along\n\nwith genus, Felis (cats) in the family Felidae. Similarly, if you observe the\n\nfeatures of a cat and a dog, you will find some similarities and  some\n\ndifferences as well. They are separated into two different families – Felidae\n\nand Canidae, respectively.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n10 BIOLOGY\n\n1.3.4 Order\n\nYou have seen earlier that categories like species, genus and\n\nfamilies are based on a number of similar characters.   Generally,\n\norder and other higher taxonomic categories are identified based\n\non the aggregates of characters.  Order being a higher category,\n\nis the assemblage of families which exhibit a few similar\n\ncharacters.  The similar characters are less in number as\n\ncompared to different genera included in a family.  Plant families\n\nlike Convolvulaceae, Solanaceae are included in the order\n\nPolymoniales mainly based on the floral characters. The animal\n\norder, Carnivora, includes families like Felidae and Canidae.\n\n1.3.5 Class\n\nThis category includes related orders. For example, order Primata\n\ncomprising monkey, gorilla and gibbon is placed in class\n\nMammalia along with order Carnivora that includes animals like\n\ntiger, cat and dog. Class Mammalia has other orders also.\n\n1.3.6 Phylum\n\nClasses comprising animals like fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds\n\nalong with mammals constitute the next higher category called\n\nPhylum. All these, based on the common features like presence\n\nof notochord and dorsal hollow neural system, are included in\n\nphylum Chordata.  In case of plants,  classes with a few similar\n\ncharacters are assigned to a higher category called Division.\n\n1.3.7 Kingdom\n\nAll animals belonging to various phyla are assigned to the\n\nhighest category called Kingdom Animalia in the classification\n\nsystem of animals. The Kingdom Plantae, on the other hand, is\n\ndistinct, and comprises all plants from various divisions.\n\nHenceforth, we will refer to these two groups as animal and\n\nplant kingdoms.\n\nThe taxonomic categories from species to kingdom have been\n\nshown in ascending order starting with species in Figure 1.1.\n\nThese are broad categories.  However, taxonomists have also\n\ndeveloped sub-categories in this hierarchy to facilitate more\n\nsound and scientific placement of various taxa.\n\nLook at the hierarchy in Figure 1.1. Can you recall the basis\n\nof arrangement? Say, for example, as we go higher from species\n\nto kingdom, the number of common characteristics goes on\n\nFigure 1.1 Taxonomic\nc a t e g o r i e s\ns h o w i n g\nhierarchial\narrangement\nin ascending\norder\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTHE LIVING WORLD 11\n\n1.4 TAXONOMICAL AIDS\n\nTaxonomic studies of various species of plants, animals and other\n\norganisms are useful in agriculture, forestry, industry and in general in\n\nknowing our bio-resources and their diversity. These studies would\n\nrequire correct classification and identification of organisms. Identification\n\nof organisms requires intensive laboratory and field studies. The collection\n\nof actual specimens of plant and animal species is essential and is the\n\nprime source of taxonomic studies. These are also fundamental to studies\n\nand essential for training in systematics. It is used for classification of an\n\norganism, and the information gathered is also stored along with the\n\nspecimens. In some cases the specimen is preserved for future studies.\n\nBiologists have established certain procedures and techniques to store\n\nand preserve the information as well as the specimens.  Some of these are\n\nexplained to help you understand the usage of these aids.\n\n1.4.1 Herbarium\n\nHerbarium is a store house of collected plant specimens that are dried,\n\npressed and preserved on sheets. Further, these sheets are arranged\n\ndecreasing. Lower the taxa, more are the characteristics that the members\n\nwithin the taxon share. Higher the category, greater is the difficulty of\n\ndetermining the relationship to other taxa at the same level. Hence, the\n\nproblem of classification becomes more complex.\n\nTable 1.1 indicates the taxonomic categories to which some common\n\norganisms like housefly, man, mango and wheat belong.\n\nCommon Biological Genus Family Order Class Phylum/\nName  Name Division\n\nMan Homo sapiens Homo Hominidae Primata Mammalia Chordata\n\nHousefly Musca Musca Muscidae Diptera Insecta Arthropoda\ndomestica\n\nMango Mangifera Mangifera Anacardiaceae Sapindales Dicotyledonae Angiospermae\nindica\n\nWheat Triticum Triticum Poaceae Poales Monocotyledonae Angiospermae\naestivum\n\nTABLE 1.1  Organisms with their Taxonomic Categories\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n12 BIOLOGY\n\naccording to a universally accepted system of classification. These\n\nspecimens, along with their descriptions on herbarium sheets, become a\n\nstore house or repository for future use (Figure 1.2). The herbarium sheets\n\nalso carry a label providing information about date and place of collection,\n\nEnglish, local and botanical names, family, collector’s name, etc. Herbaria\n\nalso serve as quick referral systems in taxonomical studies.\n\n1.4.2 Botanical Gardens\n\nThese specialised gardens have collections of living plants for reference.\n\nPlant species in these gardens are grown for identification purposes and\n\neach plant is labelled indicating its botanical/scientific name and its family.\n\nThe famous botanical gardens are at Kew (England), Indian Botanical\n\nGarden, Howrah (India) and at National Botanical Research Institute,\n\nLucknow (India).\n\n1.4.3 Museum\n\nBiological museums are generally set up in educational institutes such\n\nas schools and colleges. Museums have collections of  preserved plant\n\nand animal specimens for study and reference.  Specimens are preserved\n\nin the containers or jars in preservative solutions. Plant and animal\n\nspecimens may also be preserved as dry specimens. Insects are preserved\n\nin insect boxes after collecting, killing and pinning. Larger animals like\n\nbirds and mammals are usually stuffed and preserved. Museums often\n\nhave collections of skeletons of animals too.\n\nFigure 1.2  Herbarium showing stored specimens\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTHE LIVING WORLD 13\n\n1.4.4 Zoological Parks\n\nThese are the places where wild animals are kept in protected environments\n\nunder human care and which enable us to learn about their food habits\n\nand behaviour. All animals in a zoo are provided, as far as possible, the\n\nconditions similar to their natural habitats. Children love visiting these\n\nparks, commonly called Zoos (Figure 1.3).\n\nFigure 1.3  Pictures showing animals in different zoological parks of India\n\n1.4.5 Key\n\nKey is another taxonomical aid used for identification of plants and animals\n\nbased on the similarities and dissimilarities. The keys are based on the\n\ncontrasting characters generally in a pair called couplet.  It represents\n\nthe choice made between two opposite options. This results in acceptance\n\nof only one and rejection of the other. Each statement in the key is called\n\na lead.  Separate taxonomic keys are required for each taxonomic category\n\nsuch as family, genus and species for identification purposes. Keys are\n\ngenerally analytical in nature.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n14 BIOLOGY\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe living world is rich in variety. Millions of plants and animals have been\n\nidentified and described but a large number still remains unknown. The very\n\nrange of organisms in terms of size, colour, habitat, physiological and\n\nmorphological features make us seek the defining characteristics of living\n\norganisms. In order to facilitate the study of kinds and diversity of organisms,\n\nbiologists have evolved certain rules and principles for identification, nomenclature\n\nand classification of organisms. The branch of knowledge dealing with these aspects\n\nis referred to as taxonomy. The taxonomic studies of various species of plants\n\nand animals are useful in agriculture, forestry, industry and in general for knowing\n\nour bio-resources and their diversity. The basics of taxonomy like identification,\n\nnaming and classification of organisms are universally evolved under international\n\ncodes. Based on the resemblances and distinct differences, each organism is\n\nidentified and assigned a correct scientific/biological name comprising two words\n\nas per the binomial system of nomenclature. An organism represents/occupies a\n\nplace or position in the system of classification. There are many categories/ranks\n\nand are generally referred to as taxonomic categories or taxa. All the categories\n\nconstitute a taxonomic hierarchy.\n\nTaxonomists have developed a variety of taxonomic aids to facilitate\n\nidentification, naming and classification of organisms.  These studies are carried\n\nout from the actual specimens which are collected from the field and preserved as\n\nreferrals in the form of herbaria, museums and in botanical gardens and zoological\n\nparks. It requires special techniques for collection and preservation of specimens\n\nin herbaria and museums. Live specimens, on the other hand, of plants and\n\nanimals, are found in botanical gardens or in zoological parks. Taxonomists also\n\nprepare and disseminate information through manuals and monographs for\n\nfurther taxonomic studies. Taxonomic keys are tools that help in identification\n\nbased on characteristics.\n\nFlora, manuals, monographs and catalogues are some other means\n\nof recording descriptions. They also help in correct identification. Flora\n\ncontains the actual account of habitat and distribution of plants of a\n\ngiven area. These provide the index to the plant species found in a\n\nparticular area. Manuals are useful in providing information for\n\nidentification of names of species found in an area. Monographs contain\n\ninformation on any one taxon.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTHE LIVING WORLD 15\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1. Why are living organisms classified?\n\n2.

It was done instinctively not using criteria that were\n\nscientific but borne out of a need to use organisms for our own use – for\n\nfood, shelter and clothing.  Aristotle was the earliest to attempt a more\n\nscientific basis for classification. He used simple morphological characters\n\nto classify plants into trees, shrubs and herbs. He also divided animals\n\ninto two groups, those which had red blood and those that did not.\n\nIn Linnaeus' time a Two Kingdom system of classification with\n\nPlantae  and Animalia kingdoms was developed that included all\n\nplants and animals respectively. This system did not distinguish between\n\nthe eukaryotes and prokaryotes, unicellular and multicellular organisms\n\nand photosynthetic (green algae) and non-photosynthetic (fungi)\n\norganisms. Classification of organisms into plants and animals was easily\n\ndone and was easy to understand, but, a large number of organisms\n\ndid not fall into either category. Hence the two kingdom classification\n\nused for a long time was found inadequate.  Besides, gross morphology\n\na need was also felt for including other characteristics like cell structure,\n\nnature of wall, mode of nutrition, habitat, methods of reproduction,\n\nevolutionary relationships, etc.  Classification systems for the living\n\norganisms have hence, undergone several changes over the time.\n\nThough plant and animal kingdoms have been a constant under all\n\ndifferent systems, the understanding of what groups/organisms be\n\nincluded under these kingdoms have been changing; the number and\n\nnature of other kingdoms have also been understood differently by\n\ndifferent scientists over the time.\n\nBIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION\n\nCHAPTER  2\n\n2.1 Kingdom Monera\n\n2.2 Kingdom Protista\n\n2.3 Kingdom Fungi\n\n2.4 Kingdom Plantae\n\n2.5 Kingdom\n\nAnimalia\n\n2.6 Viruses, Viroids\n\nand Lichens\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nBIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION 17\n\nR.H. Whittaker (1969) proposed a Five Kingdom Classification. The\n\nkingdoms defined by him were named Monera, Protista, Fungi, Plantae\n\nand Animalia. The main criteria for classification used by him include cell\n\nstructure, body organisation, mode of nutrition, reproduction and\n\nphylogenetic relationships. Table 2.1 gives a comparative account of different\n\ncharacteristics of the five kingdoms.\n\nThe three-domain system has also been proposed that divides the Kingdom\n\nMonera into two domains, leaving the remaining eukaryotic kingdoms in the\n\nthird domain and thereby a six kingdom classification. You will learn about\n\nthis system in detail at higher classes.\n\nLet us look at this five kingdom classification to understand the issues\n\nand considerations that influenced the classification system. Earlier\n\nclassification systems included bacteria, blue green algae, fungi, mosses,\n\nferns, gymnosperms and the angiosperms under ‘Plants’. The character\n\nthat unified this whole kingdom was that all the organisms included had a\n\ncell wall in their cells.  This placed together groups which widely differed in\n\nother characteristics. It brought together the prokaryotic bacteria and the\n\nblue green algae ( cyanobacteria) with other groups which were eukaryotic.\n\nIt also grouped together the unicellular organisms and the multicellular\n\nones, say, for example, Chlamydomonas and Spirogyra were placed together\n\nunder algae. The classification did not differentiate between the heterotrophic\n\ngroup – fungi, and the autotrophic green plants, though they also showed\n\na characteristic difference in their walls composition – the fungi had chitin\n\nFive Kingdoms\nCharacters\n\nCell type\n\nCell wall\n\nNuclear\nmembrane\nBody\norganisation\n\nMode of\nnutrition\n\nMonera\n\nProkaryotic\n\nNoncellulosic\n(Polysaccharide\n+ amino acid)\n\nAbsent\n\nCellular\n\nAutotrophic\n(chemosyn-\nthetic and\nphotosynthetic)\nand Hetero-\ntrophic (sapro-\nphytic/para-\nsitic)\n\nProtista\n\nEukaryotic\n\nPresent in\nsome\n\nPresent\n\nCellular\n\nAutotrophic\n(Photosyn-\nthetic) and\nHetero-\ntrophic\n\nFungi\n\nEukaryotic\n\nPresent\nwith chitin\n\nPresent\n\nMult iceul lar/\nloose tissue\n\nHeterotrophic\n(Saprophytic/\nParasitic)\n\nPlantae\n\nEukaryotic\n\nPresent\n(cellulose)\n\nPresent\n\nTissue/\norgan\n\nAutotrophic\n(Photosyn-\nthetic)\n\nAnimalia\n\nEukaryotic\n\nAbsent\n\nPresent\n\nTissue/organ/\norgan system\n\nHeterotrophic\n( H o l o z o i c /\nSaprophy t i c\netc.)\n\nTABLE 2.1  Characteristics of the Five Kingdoms\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n18 BIOLOGY\n\nin their walls while the green plants had a cellulosic cell wall.  When such\n\ncharacteristics were considered, the fungi were placed in a separate\n\nkingdom – Kingdom Fungi. All prokaryotic organisms were grouped\n\ntogether under Kingdom Monera and the unicellular eukaryotic organisms\n\nwere placed in Kingdom Protista. Kingdom Protista has brought together\n\nChlamydomonas, Chlorella (earlier placed in Algae within Plants and both\n\nhaving cell walls) with Paramoecium and Amoeba (which were earlier placed\n\nin the animal kingdom which lack cell wall). It has put together organisms\n\nwhich, in earlier classifications, were placed in different kingdoms.  This\n\nhappened because the criteria for classification changed. This kind of\n\nchanges will take place in future too depending on the improvement in our\n\nunderstanding of characteristics and evolutionary relationships. Over time,\n\nan attempt has been made to evolve a classification system which reflects\n\nnot only the morphological, physiological and reproductive similarities,\n\nbut is also phylogenetic, i.e., is based on  evolutionary relationships.\n\nIn this chapter we will study characteristics of Kingdoms Monera,\n\nProtista and Fungi of the Whittaker system of classification.  The Kingdoms\n\nPlantae and Animalia, commonly referred to as plant and animal\n\nkingdoms, respectively, will be dealt separately in chapters 3 and 4.\n\nSpore Flagellum\n\nCocci Bacilli\nSpirilla\n\nVibrio\n\nFigure 2.1 Bacteria of different shapes\n\n2.1 KINGDOM MONERA\n\nBacteria are the sole members of the Kingdom Monera. They are the most\n\nabundant micro-organisms. Bacteria occur almost everywhere. Hundreds\n\nof bacteria are present in a handful of soil. They also live in extreme habitats\n\nsuch as hot springs, deserts, snow and deep oceans where very few other\n\nlife forms can survive. Many of them live in or on other organisms as\n\nparasites.\n\nBacteria are grouped under four categories based on their shape: the\n\nspherical Coccus (pl.: cocci), the rod-shaped Bacillus (pl.: bacilli), the\n\ncomma-shaped Vibrium (pl.: vibrio) and the spiral Spirillum (pl.: spirilla)\n\n(Figure 2.1).\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nBIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION 19\n\nThough the bacterial structure is very simple, they are very complex\n\nin behaviour. Compared to many other organisms, bacteria as a group\n\nshow the most extensive metabolic diversity. Some of the bacteria are\n\nautotrophic, i.e., they synthesise their own food from inorganic substrates.\n\nThey may be photosynthetic autotrophic or chemosynthetic autotrophic.\n\nThe vast majority of bacteria are heterotrophs, i.e., they depend on other\n\norganisms or on dead organic matter for food.\n\n2.1.1 Archaebacteria\n\nThese bacteria are special since they live in some of the most harsh habitats\n\nsuch as extreme salty areas (halophiles), hot springs (thermoacidophiles)\n\nand marshy areas (methanogens). Archaebacteria differ from other bacteria\n\nin having a different cell wall structure and this feature is responsible for\n\ntheir survival in extreme conditions. Methanogens are present in the gut\n\nof several ruminant animals such as cows and buffaloes and they are\n\nresponsible for the production of methane (biogas) from the dung of these\n\nanimals.\n\nFigure 2.2 A filamentous blue-green\nalgae – Nostoc\n\n2.1.2 Eubacteria\n\nThere are thousands of different eubacteria or ‘true\n\nbacteria’. They are characterised by the presence of a\n\nrigid cell wall, and if motile, a flagellum. The\n\ncyanobacteria (also referred to as blue-green algae)\n\nhave chlorophyll a similar to green plants and are\n\nphotosynthetic autotrophs (Figure 2.2). The\n\ncyanobacteria are unicellular, colonial or filamentous,\n\nfreshwater/marine or terrestrial algae. The colonies\n\nare generally surrounded by gelatinous sheath. They\n\noften form blooms in polluted water bodies. Some of\n\nthese organisms can fix atmospheric nitrogen in\n\nspecialised cells called heterocysts, e.g., Nostoc and\n\nAnabaena. Chemosynthetic autotrophic bacteria\n\noxidise various inorganic substances such as\n\nnitrates, nitrites and ammonia and use the released\n\nenergy for their ATP production. They play a great role\n\nin recycling nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorous,\n\niron and sulphur.\n\nHeterotrophic bacteria are most abundant in\n\nnature. The majority are important decomposers.\n\nMany of them have a significant impact on human\n\naffairs. They are helpful in making curd from milk,\n\nproduction  of antibiotics, fixing nitrogen in legume\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n20 BIOLOGY\n\nroots, etc. Some are pathogens causing damage\n\nto human beings, crops, farm animals and pets.\n\nCholera, typhoid, tetanus, citrus canker are well\n\nknown diseases  caused by different bacteria.\n\nBacteria reproduce mainly by fission (Figure\n\n2.3). Sometimes, under unfavourable conditions,\n\nthey produce spores. They also reproduce by a\n\nsort of sexual reproduction by adopting a\n\nprimitive type of DNA transfer from one bacterium\n\nto the other.\n\nThe Mycoplasma are organisms that\n\ncompletely lack a cell wall. They are the smallest\n\nliving cells known and can survive without oxygen. Many mycoplasma\n\nare pathogenic in animals and plants.\n\n2.2 KINGDOM PROTISTA\n\nAll single-celled eukaryotes are placed under Protista, but the boundaries\n\nof this kingdom are not well defined. What may be ‘a photosynthetic\n\nprotistan’ to one biologist may be ‘a plant’ to another. In this book we\n\ninclude Chrysophytes, Dinoflagellates, Euglenoids, Slime moulds and\n\nProtozoans under Protista. Members of Protista are primarily aquatic.\n\nThis kingdom forms a link with the others dealing with plants, animals\n\nand fungi. Being eukaryotes, the protistan cell body contains a well defined\n\nnucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. Some have flagella or\n\ncilia. Protists reproduce asexually and sexually by a process involving\n\ncell fusion and zygote formation.\n\n2.2.1 Chrysophytes\n\nThis group includes diatoms and golden algae (desmids). They are found\n\nin fresh water as well as in marine environments. They are microscopic\n\nand float passively in water currents (plankton). Most of them are\n\nphotosynthetic. In diatoms the cell walls form two thin overlapping shells,\n\nwhich fit together as in a soap box. The walls are embedded with silica\n\nand thus the walls are indestructible. Thus, diatoms have left behind\n\nlarge amount of cell wall deposits in their habitat; this accumulation over\n\nbillions of years is referred to as ‘diatomaceous earth’. Being gritty this\n\nsoil is used in polishing, filtration of oils and syrups. Diatoms are the\n\nchief ‘producers’ in the oceans.\n\nFigure 2.3 A dividing bacterium\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nBIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION 21\n\n2.2.2 Dinoflagellates\n\nThese organisms are mostly marine and photosynthetic.\n\nThey appear yellow, green, brown, blue or red depending\n\non the main pigments present in their cells. The cell wall\n\nhas stiff cellulose plates on the outer surface. Most of\n\nthem have two flagella; one lies longitudinally and the\n\nother transversely in a furrow between the wall plates.\n\nVery often, red dinoflagellates (Example: Gonyaulax)\n\nundergo such rapid multiplication that they make the\n\nsea appear red (red tides). Toxins released by such large\n\nnumbers may even kill other marine animals such as\n\nfishes.\n\n2.2.3 Euglenoids\n\nMajority of them are fresh water organisms found in\n\nstagnant water. Instead of a cell wall, they have a protein\n\nrich layer called pellicle which makes their body flexible.\n\nThey have two flagella, a short and a long one. Though\n\nthey are photosynthetic in the presence of sunlight, when\n\ndeprived of sunlight they behave like heterotrophs by\n\npredating on other smaller organisms. Interestingly, the\n\npigments of euglenoids are identical to those present in\n\nhigher plants. Example: Euglena (Figure 2.4b).\n\n2.2.4 Slime Moulds\n\nSlime moulds are saprophytic protists. The body moves\n\nalong decaying twigs and leaves engulfing organic\n\nmaterial. Under suitable conditions, they form an\n\naggregation called plasmodium which may grow and\n\nspread over several feet. During unfavourable conditions,\n\nthe plasmodium differentiates and forms fruiting bodies\n\nbearing spores at their tips. The spores possess true walls.\n\nThey are extremely resistant and survive for many years,\n\neven under adverse conditions. The spores are dispersed\n\nby air currents.\n\n2.2.5 Protozoans\n\nAll protozoans are heterotrophs and live as predators or\n\nparasites. They are believed to be primitive relatives of\n\nanimals. There are four major groups of protozoans.\n\nAmoeboid protozoans: These organisms live in fresh\n\nwater, sea water or moist soil. They move and capture\n\nFigure 2.4 (a) Dinoflagellates\n(b) Euglena\n(c) Slime mould\n(d) Paramoecium\n\n(d)\n\n(a)\n\n(c)\n\n(b)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n22 BIOLOGY\n\ntheir prey by putting out pseudopodia (false feet) as in Amoeba. Marine\n\nforms have silica shells on their surface. Some of them such as Entamoeba\n\nare parasites.\n\nFlagellated protozoans: The members of this group are either free-living\n\nor parasitic. They have flagella. The parasitic forms cause diaseases such\n\nas sleeping sickness. Example: Trypanosoma.\n\nCiliated protozoans: These are aquatic, actively moving organisms because\n\nof the presence of thousands of cilia. They have a cavity (gullet) that opens\n\nto the outside of the cell surface. The coordinated movement of rows of\n\ncilia causes the water laden with food to be steered into the gullet. Example:\n\nParamoecium (Figure 2.4d).\n\nSporozoans: This includes diverse organisms that have an infectious\n\nspore-like stage in their life cycle. The most notorious is Plasmodium\n\n(malarial parasite) which causes malaria, a disease which has a staggering\n\neffect on human population.\n\n2.3 KINGDOM FUNGI\n\nThe fungi constitute a unique kingdom of heterotrophic organisms. They\n\nshow a great diversity in morphology and habitat. You  must have seen\n\nfungi on a moist bread and rotten fruits. The common mushroom you eat\n\nand toadstools are also fungi. White spots seen on mustard leaves are due\n\nto a parasitic fungus. Some unicellular fungi, e.g., yeast are used to make\n\nbread and beer. Other fungi cause diseases in plants and animals; wheat\n\nrust-causing Puccinia is an important example. Some are the source of\n\nantibiotics, e.g., Penicillium. Fungi are cosmopolitan and occur in air, water,\n\nsoil and on animals and plants.  They prefer to grow in warm and humid\n\nplaces. Have you ever wondered why we keep food in the refrigerator ? Yes,\n\nit is to prevent food from going bad due to bacterial or fungal infections.\n\nWith the exception of yeasts which are unicellular, fungi are\n\nfilamentous. Their bodies consist of long, slender thread-like structures\n\ncalled hyphae. The network of hyphae is known as mycelium. Some hyphae\n\nare continuous tubes filled with multinucleated cytoplasm – these are\n\ncalled coenocytic hyphae. Others have septae or cross walls in their\n\nhyphae. The cell walls of fungi are composed of chitin and polysaccharides.\n\nMost fungi are heterotrophic and absorb soluble organic matter from\n\ndead substrates and hence are  called saprophytes. Those that depend\n\non living plants and animals are called parasites. They can also live as\n\nsymbionts – in association with algae as lichens and with roots of higher\n\nplants as mycorrhiza.\n\nReproduction in fungi can take place by vegetative means –\n\nfragmentation, fission and budding. Asexual reproduction is by spores\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nBIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION 23\n\ncalled conidia or sporangiospores or zoospores, and sexual reproduction\n\nis by oospores, ascospores and basidiospores. The various spores are\n\nproduced in distinct structures called fruiting bodies. The sexual cycle\n\ninvolves the following  three steps:\n\n(i) Fusion of protoplasms between two motile or non-motile gametes\n\ncalled plasmogamy.\n\n(ii) Fusion of two nuclei called karyogamy.\n\n(iii) Meiosis in zygote resulting in haploid spores.\n\nWhen a fungus reproduces sexually, two haploid\n\nhyphae of compatible mating types come together and\n\nfuse. In some fungi the fusion of two haploid cells\n\nimmediately results in diploid cells (2n). However, in other\n\nfungi (ascomycetes and basidiomycetes), an intervening\n\ndikaryotic stage (n + n, i.e., two nuclei per cell) occurs;\n\nsuch a condition is called a dikaryon and the phase is\n\ncalled dikaryophase of fungus. Later, the parental nuclei\n\nfuse and the cells become diploid.  The fungi form fruiting\n\nbodies in which reduction division occurs, leading to\n\nformation of haploid spores.\n\nThe morphology of the mycelium, mode of spore\n\nformation and fruiting bodies  form the basis for the\n\ndivision of the kingdom  into various classes.\n\n2.3.1 Phycomycetes\n\nMembers of phycomycetes are found in aquatic habitats\n\nand on decaying wood in moist and damp places or as\n\nobligate parasites on plants. The mycelium is aseptate\n\nand coenocytic. Asexual reproduction takes place by\n\nzoospores (motile) or by aplanospores (non-motile). These\n\nspores are endogenously produced in sporangium. A\n\nzygospore is formed by fusion of two gametes. These\n\ngametes are similar in morphology (isogamous) or\n\ndissimilar (anisogamous or oogamous). Some common\n\nexamples are Mucor (Figure 2.5a), Rhizopus (the bread\n\nmould mentioned earlier) and Albugo (the parasitic fungi\n\non mustard).\n\n2.3.2 Ascomycetes\n\nCommonly known as sac-fungi, the ascomycetes  are mostly\n\nmulticellular, e.g., Penicillium, or rarely unicellular, e.g., yeast\n\n(Saccharomyces). They are saprophytic, decomposers,\n\nparasitic or coprophilous (growing on dung). Mycelium\n\nFigure 2.5 Fungi: (a) Mucor\n(b) Aspergillus (c) Agaricus\n\n(c)\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n24 BIOLOGY\n\nis branched and septate. The asexual spores are conidia produced\n\nexogenously on the special mycelium called conidiophores. Conidia on\n\ngermination produce mycelium. Sexual spores are called ascospores\n\nwhich are produced endogenously in sac like asci (singular ascus). These\n\nasci are arranged in different types of fruiting bodies called ascocarps.\n\nSome examples are Aspergillus (Figure 2.5b), Claviceps and Neurospora.\n\nNeurospora  is used extensively in biochemical and genetic work. Many\n\nmembers like morels and truffles are edible and are considered  delicacies.\n\n2.3.3 Basidiomycetes\n\nCommonly known forms of basidiomycetes are mushrooms, bracket fungi\n\nor puffballs. They grow in soil, on logs and tree stumps and in living\n\nplant bodies as parasites, e.g., rusts and smuts. The mycelium is branched\n\nand septate. The asexual spores are generally not found, but vegetative\n\nreproduction by fragmentation is common. The sex organs are absent,\n\nbut plasmogamy is brought about by fusion of two vegetative or somatic\n\ncells of different strains or genotypes. The resultant structure is dikaryotic\n\nwhich ultimately gives rise to basidium. Karyogamy and meiosis take\n\nplace in the basidium producing four basidiospores. The basidiospores\n\nare exogenously produced on the basidium (pl.: basidia). The basidia are\n\narranged in fruiting bodies called basidiocarps. Some common members\n\nare Agaricus (mushroom) (Figure 2.5c), Ustilago (smut) and Puccinia (rust\n\nfungus).\n\n2.3.4 Deuteromycetes\n\nCommonly known as imperfect fungi because only the asexual or\n\nvegetative phases of these fungi are known.  When the sexual forms of\n\nthese fungi were discovered they were moved into classes they rightly\n\nbelong to.  It is also possible that the asexual and vegetative stage have\n\nbeen given one name (and placed under deuteromycetes) and the sexual\n\nstage another (and placed under another class).  Later when the linkages\n\nwere established, the fungi were correctly identified and moved out of\n\ndeuteromycetes. Once perfect (sexual) stages of members of\n\ndueteromycetes were discovered they were often moved to ascomycetes\n\nand basidiomycetes. The deuteromycetes reproduce only by asexual spores\n\nknown as conidia. The mycelium is septate and branched. Some members\n\nare saprophytes or parasites while a large number of them are\n\ndecomposers of litter and help in mineral cycling. Some examples are\n\nAlternaria, Colletotrichum and Trichoderma.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nBIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION 25\n\n2.4 KINGDOM PLANTAE\n\nKingdom Plantae includes all eukaryotic chlorophyll-containing\n\norganisms commonly called plants. A few members are partially\n\nheterotrophic such as the insectivorous plants or parasites. Bladderwort\n\nand Venus fly trap are examples of insectivorous plants and Cuscuta is a\n\nparasite. The plant cells have an eukaryotic structure with prominent\n\nchloroplasts and cell wall mainly made of cellulose. You will study the\n\neukaryotic cell structure in detail in Chapter 8. Plantae includes algae,\n\nbryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms.\n\nLife cycle of plants has two distinct phases – the diploid sporophytic\n\nand the haploid gametophytic – that alternate with each other. The lengths\n\nof the haploid and diploid phases, and whether these phases are free–\n\nliving or dependent on others, vary among different groups in plants.\n\nThis phenomenon is called alternation of generation. You will study\n\nfurther details of this kingdom in Chapter 3.\n\n2.5 KINGDOM ANIMALIA\n\nThis kingdom is characterised by heterotrophic eukaryotic organisms\n\nthat are multicellular and their cells lack cell walls. They directly or\n\nindirectly depend on plants for food. They digest their food in an internal\n\ncavity and store food reserves as glycogen or fat. Their mode of nutrition\n\nis holozoic – by ingestion of food. They follow a definite growth pattern\n\nand grow into adults that have a definite shape and size. Higher forms\n\nshow elaborate sensory and neuromotor mechanism. Most of them are\n\ncapable of locomotion.\n\nThe sexual reproduction is by copulation of male and female followed\n\nby embryological development. Salient features of various phyla are\n\ndescribed in Chapter 4.\n\n2.6 VIRUSES, VIROIDS, PRIONS AND LICHENS\n\nIn the five kingdom classification of Whittaker there is no mention of lichens\n\nand some acellular organisms like viruses, viroids and prions. These are\n\nbriefly introduced here.\n\nAll of us who have suffered the ill effects of common cold or ‘flu’ know\n\nwhat effects viruses can have on us, even if we do not associate it with our\n\ncondition. Viruses did not find a place in classification since they are not\n\nconsidered truly ‘living’, if we understand living as those organisms that\n\nhave a cell structure.  The viruses are non-cellular organisms that are\n\ncharacterised by having an inert crystalline structure outside the living cell.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n26 BIOLOGY\n\nOnce they infect a cell they take over the machinery of the host cell to replicate\n\nthemselves, killing the host. Would you call viruses living or non-living?\n\nVirus means venom or poisonous fluid. Dmitri Ivanowsky (1892)\n\nrecognised certain microbes as causal organism of the mosaic disease of\n\ntobacco (Figure 2.6a). These were found to be smaller than bacteria\n\nbecause they passed through bacteria-proof filters. M.W. Beijerinek\n\n(1898) demonstrated that the extract of the infected plants of  tobacco\n\ncould cause infection in healthy plants and named the new pathogen\n\n“virus” and called the fluid as Contagium vivum fluidum (infectious living\n\nfluid).  W.M. Stanley (1935) showed that viruses could be crystallised\n\nand crystals consist largely of proteins. They are inert outside their specific\n\nhost cell. Viruses are obligate parasites.\n\nIn addition to proteins, viruses also contain genetic material, that could\n\nbe either RNA or DNA.  No virus contains both RNA and DNA.  A virus is\n\na nucleoprotein and the genetic material is infectious. In general, viruses\n\nthat infect plants have single stranded RNA and viruses that infect animals\n\nhave either single or double stranded RNA or double stranded DNA.\n\nBacterial viruses or bacteriophages (viruses that infect the bacteria) are\n\nusually double stranded DNA viruses (Figure 2.6b). The protein coat\n\ncalled capsid made of small subunits called capsomeres, protects the\n\nnucleic acid. These capsomeres are arranged in helical or polyhedral\n\ngeometric forms. Viruses cause diseases like  mumps, small pox, herpes\n\nand influenza. AIDS in humans is also caused by a virus. In plants, the\n\nsymptoms can be mosaic formation, leaf rolling and curling, yellowing\n\nand vein clearing, dwarfing  and stunted growth.\n\nRNA Capsid\n\n(a)\n\nSheath\n\nHead\n\nTail fibres\n\nCollar\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 2.6  (a) Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV)  (b) Bacteriophage\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nBIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION 27\n\nSUMMARY\n\nBiological classification of plants and animals was first proposed by Aristotle on the\n\nbasis of simple morphological characters. Linnaeus later classified all living organisms\n\ninto two kingdoms – Plantae and Animalia. Whittaker proposed an elaborate five\n\nkingdom classification – Monera, Protista, Fungi, Plantae and Animalia. The main\n\ncriteria of the five kingdom classification were cell structure, body organisation,\n\nmode of nutrition and reproduction, and phylogenetic relationships.\n\nIn the five kingdom classification, bacteria are included in Kingdom Monera.\n\nBacteria are cosmopolitan in distribution. These organisms show the most extensive\n\nmetabolic diversity. Bacteria may be autotrophic or heterotrophic in their mode of\n\nnutrition. Kingdom Protista includes all single-celled eukaryotes such as\n\nChrysophytes, Dinoflagellates, Euglenoids, Slime-moulds and Protozoans. Protists\n\nhave defined nucleus and other membrane bound organelles. They reproduce\n\nboth asexually and sexually. Members of Kingdom Fungi show a great diversity\n\nin structures and habitat. Most fungi are saprophytic in their mode of nutrition.\n\nThey show asexual and sexual reproduction. Phycomycetes, Ascomycetes,\n\nBasidiomycetes and Deuteromycetes are the four classes under this kingdom.\n\nThe plantae includes all eukaryotic chlorophyll-containing organisms. Algae,\n\nbryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms are included in this\n\ngroup. The life cycle of plants exhibit alternation of generations – gametophytic\n\nand sporophytic generations. The heterotrophic eukaryotic, multicellular\n\norganisms lacking a cell wall are included in the Kingdom Animalia. The mode of\n\nnutrition of these organisms is holozoic. They reproduce mostly by the sexual\n\nmode. Some acellular organisms like viruses and viroids as well as the lichens are\n\nnot included in the five kingdom system of classification.\n\nViroids : In 1971, T.O. Diener discovered a new infectious agent that\n\nwas smaller than viruses and caused potato spindle tuber disease. It was\n\nfound to be a free RNA; it lacked the protein coat that is found in viruses,\n\nhence the name viroid. The RNA of the viroid was of low molecular weight.\n\nPrions : In modern medicine certain infectious neurological diseases\n\nwere found to be transmitted by an agent consisting of abnormally folded\n\nprotein. The agent was similar in size to viruses. These agents were called\n\nprions. The most notable diseases caused by prions are bovine spongiform\n\nencephalopathy (BSE) commonly called   mad cow disease in cattle and\n\nits analogous variant Cr–Jacob disease (CJD) in humans.\n\nLichens : Lichens are symbiotic associations i.e. mutually useful\n\nassociations, between algae and fungi. The algal component is known as\n\nphycobiont and fungal component as mycobiont, which are autotrophic\n\nand heterotrophic, respectively. Algae prepare food for fungi and fungi\n\nprovide shelter and absorb mineral nutrients and water for its partner.\n\nSo close is their association that if one saw a lichen in nature one would\n\nnever imagine that they had two different organisms within them.  Lichens\n\nare very good pollution indicators – they do not grow in polluted areas.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n28 BIOLOGY\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1.

Monera, Protista, Fungi,\n\nAnimalia and Plantae.  In this chapter, we will deal in detail with further\n\nclassification within Kingdom Plantae popularly known as the ‘plant\n\nkingdom’.\n\nWe must stress here that our understanding of the plant kingdom\n\nhas changed over time. Fungi, and members of the Monera and Protista\n\nhaving cell walls have now been excluded from Plantae though earlier\n\nclassifications placed them in the same kingdom.  So, the cyanobacteria\n\nthat are also referred to as blue green algae are not ‘algae’ any more.  In\n\nthis chapter, we will describe Algae, Bryophytes, Pteridophytes,\n\nGymnosperms and Angiosperms under Plantae .\n\nLet us also look at classification within angiosperms to understand\n\nsome of the concerns  that influenced the classification systems. The\n\nearliest systems of classification used only gross superficial morphological\n\ncharacters such as habit, colour, number and shape of leaves, etc.  They\n\nwere based mainly on vegetative characters or on the androecium\n\nstructure (system given by Linnaeus). Such systems were artificial; they\n\nseparated the closely related species since they were based on a few\n\ncharacteristics. Also, the artificial systems gave equal weightage to\n\nvegetative and sexual characteristics; this is not acceptable since we know\n\nthat often the vegetative characters are more easily affected by\n\nenvironment. As against this, natural classification systems developed,\n\nwhich were based on natural affinities among the organisms and consider,\n\nPLANT KINGDOM\n\nCHAPTER  3\n\n3.1 Algae\n\n3.2 Bryophytes\n\n3.3 Pteridophytes\n\n3.4 Gymnosperms\n\n3.5 Angiosperms\n\n3.6 Plant Life Cycles\n\nand Alternation\n\nof Generations\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n30 BIOLOGY\n\nnot only the external features, but also internal features, like ultra-\n\nstructure, anatomy, embryology and phytochemistry. Such a\n\nclassification for flowering plants was given by George Bentham and\n\nJoseph Dalton Hooker.\n\nAt present phylogenetic classification systems based on\n\nevolutionary relationships between the various organisms are acceptable.\n\nThis assumes that organisms belonging to the same taxa have a common\n\nancestor.   We now use information from many other sources too to help\n\nresolve difficulties in classification.  These become more important when\n\nthere is no supporting fossil evidence.  Numerical Taxonomy which is\n\nnow easily carried out using computers is based on all observable\n\ncharacteristics. Number and codes are assigned to all the characters and\n\nthe data are then processed. In this way each character is given equal\n\nimportance and at the same time hundreds of characters can be\n\nconsidered.  Cytotaxonomy that is based on cytological information like\n\nchromosome number, structure, behaviour and chemotaxonomy that\n\nuses the chemical constituents of the plant to resolve confusions, are also\n\nused by taxonomists these days.\n\n3.1 ALGAE\n\nAlgae are chlorophyll-bearing, simple, thalloid, autotrophic and largely\n\naquatic (both fresh water and marine) organisms. They occur in a\n\nvariety of other habitats: moist stones, soils and wood. Some of them\n\nalso occur in association with fungi (lichen) and animals (e.g., on sloth\n\nbear).\n\nThe form and size of algae is highly variable, ranging from colonial\n\nforms like Volvox and the filamentous forms like Ulothrix and Spirogyra\n\n(Figure 3.1). A few of the marine forms such as kelps, form massive plant\n\nbodies.\n\nThe algae reproduce by vegetative, asexual and sexual methods.\n\nVegetative reproduction is by fragmentation. Each fragment develops into\n\na thallus. Asexual reproduction is by the production of different types of\n\nspores, the most common being the zoospores. They are flagellated\n\n(motile) and on germination gives rise to new plants. Sexual reproduction\n\ntakes place through fusion of two gametes. These gametes can be\n\nflagellated and similar in size (as in Ulothrix) or non-flagellated (non-motile)\n\nbut similar in size (as in Spirogyra). Such reproduction is called\n\nisogamous. Fusion of two gametes dissimilar in size, as in species of\n\nEudorina is termed as anisogamous. Fusion between one large, non-\n\nmotile (static) female gamete and a smaller, motile male gamete is termed\n\noogamous, e.g., Volvox, Fucus.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPLANT KINGDOM 31\n\nFigure 3.1  Algae : (a) Green algae   (i) Volvox         (ii) Ulothrix\n(b) Brown algae  (i) Laminaria   (ii) Fucus       (iii) Dictyota\n(c)  Red algae     (i)  Porphyra    (ii) Polysiphonia\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n32 BIOLOGY\n\nAlgae are useful to man in a variety of ways. At least a half of the total\n\ncarbon dioxide fixation on earth is carried out by algae through\n\nphotosynthesis. Being photosynthetic they increase the level of dissolved\n\noxygen in their immediate environment. They are of paramount\n\nimportance as primary producers of energy-rich compounds which form\n\nthe basis of the food cycles of all aquatic animals. Many species of Porphyra,\n\nLaminaria and Sargassum  are among the 70 species of marine algae\n\nused as food. Certain marine brown and red algae produce large amounts\n\nof hydrocolloids (water holding substances), e.g., algin (brown algae) and\n\ncarrageen (red algae) which are used commercially. Agar, one of the\n\ncommercial products obtained from Gelidium and Gracilaria are used to\n\ngrow microbes and in preparations of ice-creams and jellies. Chlorella a\n\nunicellular alga rich in proteins is used as food supplement even by space\n\ntravellers. The algae are divided into three main classes: Chlorophyceae,\n\nPhaeophyceae and Rhodophyceae.\n\n3.1.1 Chlorophyceae\n\nThe members of chlorophyceae are commonly called green algae. The\n\nplant body may be unicellular, colonial or filamentous. They are usually\n\ngrass green due to the dominance of pigments chlorophyll a and b. The\n\npigments are localised in definite chloroplasts. The chloroplasts may be\n\ndiscoid, plate-like, reticulate, cup-shaped, spiral or ribbon-shaped in\n\ndifferent species. Most of the members have one or more storage bodies\n\ncalled pyrenoids located in the chloroplasts. Pyrenoids contain protein\n\nbesides starch. Some algae may store food in the form of oil droplets.\n\nGreen algae usually have a rigid cell wall made of an inner layer of cellulose\n\nand an outer layer of pectose.\n\nVegetative reproduction usually takes place by fragmentation or by\n\nformation of different types of spores. Asexual reproduction is by\n\nflagellated zoospores produced in zoosporangia. The sexual reproduction\n\nshows considerable variation in the type and formation of sex cells and it\n\nmay be isogamous, anisogamous or oogamous. Some commonly found\n\ngreen algae are: Chlamydomonas, Volvox, Ulothrix, Spirogyra and Chara\n\n(Figure 3.1a).\n\n3.1.2 Phaeophyceae\n\nThe members of phaeophyceae or brown algae are found primarily in\n\nmarine habitats. They show great variation in size and form. They range\n\nfrom simple branched, filamentous forms (Ectocarpus) to profusely\n\nbranched forms as represented by kelps, which may reach a height of\n\n100 metres. They possess chlorophyll a, c, carotenoids and xanthophylls.\n\nThey vary in colour from olive green to various shades of brown depending\n\nupon the amount of the xanthophyll pigment, fucoxanthin present in\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPLANT KINGDOM 33\n\nthem. Food is stored as complex carbohydrates, which may be in the\n\nform of laminarin or mannitol. The vegetative cells have a cellulosic wall\n\nusually covered on the outside by a gelatinous coating of algin. The\n\nprotoplast contains, in addition to plastids, a centrally located vacuole\n\nand nucleus. The plant body is usually attached to the substratum by a\n\nholdfast, and has a stalk, the stipe and leaf like photosynthetic organ –\n\nthe frond. Vegetative reproduction takes place by fragmentation. Asexual\n\nreproduction in most brown algae is by biflagellate zoospores that are\n\npear-shaped and have two unequal laterally attached flagella.\n\nSexual reproduction may be isogamous, anisogamous or oogamous.\n\nUnion of gametes may take place in water or within the oogonium\n\n(oogamous species). The gametes are pyriform (pear-shaped) and bear\n\ntwo laterally attached flagella. The common forms are Ectocarpus, Dictyota,\n\nLaminaria, Sargassum and Fucus (Figure 3.1b).\n\n3.1.3 Rhodophyceae\n\nThe members of rhodophyceae are commonly called red algae because of\n\nthe predominance of the red pigment, r-phycoerythrin in their body. Majority\n\nof the red algae are marine with greater concentrations found in the warmer\n\nareas. They occur in both well-lighted regions close to the surface of water\n\nand also at great depths in oceans where relatively little light penetrates.\n\nThe red thalli of most of the red algae are  multicellular. Some of them\n\nhave complex body organisation. The food is stored as floridean starch\n\nwhich is very similar to amylopectin and glycogen in structure.\n\nThe red algae usually reproduce vegetatively by fragmentation. They\n\nreproduce asexually by non-motile spores and sexually by non-motile\n\nTABLE 3.1 Divisions of Algae and their Main Characteristics\n\nClasses Common Major Stored Cell Wall Flagellar Habitat\nName Pigments Food Number and\n\nPosition of\nInsertions\n\nChlorophyceae Green Chlorophyll Starch Cellulose 2-8, equal, Fresh water,\nalgae a, b apical brackish water,\n\nsalt water\n\nPhaeophyceae Brown Chlorophyll Mannitol, Cellulose 2, unequal, Fresh water\nalgae a, c, laminarin and algin lateral (rare) brackish\n\nfucoxanthin water, salt\nwater\n\nRhodophyceae Red Chlorophyll Floridean Cellulose, Absent Fresh water\nalgae a, d, starch pectin and (some),\n\nphycoerythrin poly brackish\nsulphate water, salt\nesters water (most)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n34 BIOLOGY\n\ngametes.

They usually occur in damp, humid and shaded localities.\n\nThey play an important role in plant succession on bare rocks/soil.\n\nThe plant body of bryophytes is more differentiated than that of algae.\n\nIt is thallus-like and prostrate or erect, and attached to the substratum\n\nby unicellular or multicellular rhizoids. They lack true roots, stem or\n\nleaves. They may possess root-like, leaf-like or stem-like structures. The\n\nmain plant body of the bryophyte is haploid. It produces gametes, hence\n\nis called a gametophyte. The sex organs in bryophytes are multicellular.\n\nThe male sex organ is called antheridium. They produce biflagellate\n\nantherozoids. The female sex organ called archegonium is flask-shaped\n\nand produces a single egg. The antherozoids are released into water where\n\nthey come in contact with archegonium. An antherozoid fuses with the\n\negg to produce the zygote. Zygotes do not undergo reduction division\n\nimmediately. They produce a multicellular body called a sporophyte.\n\nThe sporophyte is not free-living but attached to the photosynthetic\n\ngametophyte and derives nourishment from it. Some cells of the\n\nsporophyte undergo reduction division (meiosis) to produce haploid\n\nspores.  These spores germinate to produce gametophyte.\n\nBryophytes in general are of little economic importance but some\n\nmosses provide food for herbaceous mammals, birds and other animals.\n\nSpecies of Sphagnum, a moss, provide peat that have long been used as\n\nfuel,  and as packing material for trans-shipment of living material because\n\nof their capacity to hold water. Mosses along with lichens are the first\n\norganisms to colonise rocks and hence, are of great ecological importance.\n\nThey decompose rocks making the substrate suitable for the growth of\n\nhigher plants. Since mosses form dense mats on the soil, they reduce the\n\nimpact of falling rain and prevent soil erosion. The bryophytes are divided\n\ninto liverworts and mosses.\n\n3.2.1 Liverworts\n\nThe liverworts grow usually in moist, shady habitats such as banks of\n\nstreams, marshy ground, damp soil, bark of trees and deep in the woods.\n\nThe plant body of a liverwort is thalloid, e.g., Marchantia. The thallus is\n\ndorsiventral and closely appressed to the substrate. The leafy members\n\nhave tiny leaf-like appendages in two rows on the stem-like structures.\n\nAsexual reproduction in liverworts takes place by fragmentation of\n\nthalli, or by the formation of specialised structures called gemmae\n\n(sing. gemma). Gemmae are green, multicellular, asexual buds, which\n\ndevelop in small receptacles  called gemma cups located on the thalli.\n\nThe gemmae become detached from the parent body and germinate to\n\nform new individuals. During sexual reproduction, male and female sex\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n36 BIOLOGY\n\norgans are produced either on the same or on different thalli. The\n\nsporophyte is differentiated into a foot, seta and capsule. After meiosis,\n\nspores are produced within the capsule. These spores germinate to form\n\nfree-living gametophytes.\n\n3.2.2 Mosses\n\nThe predominant stage of the life cycle of a moss is the gametophyte which\n\nconsists of two stages. The first stage is the protonema stage, which\n\ndevelops directly from a spore. It is a creeping, green, branched and\n\nfrequently filamentous stage. The second stage is the leafy stage, which\n\ndevelops from the secondary protonema as a lateral bud. They consist of\n\nupright, slender axes bearing spirally arranged leaves. They are attached\n\nto the soil through multicellular and branched rhizoids. This stage bears\n\nthe sex organs.\n\nVegetative reproduction in mosses is by fragmentation and budding\n\nin the secondary protonema. In sexual reproduction, the sex organs\n\nantheridia and archegonia are produced at the apex of the leafy shoots.\n\nAfter fertilisation, the zygote develops into a sporophyte, consisting of a\n\nfoot, seta and capsule. The sporophyte in mosses is more elaborate than\n\nthat in liverworts. The capsule contains spores. Spores are formed after\n\nmeiosis. The mosses have an elaborate mechanism of spore dispersal.\n\nCommon examples of mosses are Funaria, Polytrichum and Sphagnum\n\n(Figure 3.2).\n\n3.3 PTERIDOPHYTES\n\nThe Pteridophytes include horsetails and ferns. Pteridophytes are used\n\nfor medicinal purposes and as soil-binders. They are also frequently grown\n\nas ornamentals. Evolutionarily, they are the first terrestrial plants to\n\npossess vascular tissues – xylem and phloem. You shall study more about\n\nthese tissues in Chapter 6. The pteridophytes are found in cool, damp,\n\nshady places though some may flourish well in sandy-soil conditions.\n\nYou may recall that in bryophytes the dominant phase in the life\n\ncycle is the gametophytic plant body. However, in pteridophytes, the\n\nmain plant body is a sporophyte which is differentiated into true root,\n\nstem and leaves (Figure 3.3). These organs possess well-differentiated\n\nvascular tissues. The leaves in pteridophyta are small (microphylls) as\n\nin Selaginella or large (macrophylls) as in ferns. The sporophytes bear\n\nsporangia that are subtended by leaf-like appendages called\n\nsporophylls. In some cases sporophylls may form distinct compact\n\nstructures called strobili or cones (Selaginella, Equisetum). The\n\nsporangia produce spores by meiosis in spore mother cells. The spores\n\ngerminate to give rise to inconspicuous, small but multicellular,\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPLANT KINGDOM 37\n\nFigure 3.3  Pteridophytes :  (a) Selaginella  (b) Equisetum  (c) Fern (d) Salvinia\n\nStrobilus\n\nNode\n\nInternode\n\nBranch\n\nRhizome\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n(d)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n38 BIOLOGY\n\nfree-living, mostly photosynthetic thalloid gametophytes called\n\nprothallus. These gametophytes require cool, damp, shady places to\n\ngrow. Because of this specific restricted requirement and the need for\n\nwater for fertilisation, the spread of living pteridophytes is limited and\n\nrestricted to narrow geographical regions. The gametophytes bear male\n\nand female sex organs called antheridia and archegonia, respectively.\n\nWater is required for transfer of antherozoids – the male gametes released\n\nfrom the antheridia, to the mouth of archegonium. Fusion of male gamete\n\nwith the egg present in the archegonium result in the formation of zygote.\n\nZygote thereafter produces a multicellular well-differentiated sporophyte\n\nwhich is the dominant phase of the pteridophytes. In majority of the\n\npteridophytes all the spores are of similar kinds; such plants are called\n\nhomosporous. Genera like Selaginella and Salvinia which produce\n\ntwo kinds of spores, macro (large) and micro (small) spores, are known\n\nas heterosporous. The megaspores and microspores germinate and give\n\nrise to female and male gametophytes, respectively. The female\n\ngametophytes in these plants are retained on the parent sporophytes\n\nfor variable periods. The development of the zygotes into young embryos\n\ntake place within the female gametophytes. This event is a precursor to\n\nthe seed habit considered an important step in evolution.\n\nThe pteridophytes are further classified into four classes: Psilopsida\n\n(Psilotum); Lycopsida (Selaginella, Lycopodium), Sphenopsida (Equisetum)\n\nand Pteropsida (Dryopteris, Pteris, Adiantum).\n\n3.4 GYMNOSPERMS\n\nThe gymnosperms (gymnos : naked, sperma : seeds) are plants in which\n\nthe ovules are not enclosed by any ovary wall and remain exposed, both\n\nbefore and after fertilisation. The seeds that develop post-fertilisation, are\n\nnot covered, i.e., are naked. Gymnosperms include medium-sized trees\n\nor tall trees and shrubs (Figure 3.4). One of the gymnosperms, the giant\n\nredwood tree Sequoia is one of the tallest tree species. The roots are\n\ngenerally tap roots. Roots in some genera have fungal association in the\n\nform of mycorrhiza (Pinus), while in some others (Cycas) small specialised\n\nroots called coralloid roots are associated with N\n2\n- fixing cyanobacteria.\n\nThe stems are unbranched (Cycas) or branched (Pinus, Cedrus). The leaves\n\nmay be simple or compound. In Cycas the pinnate leaves persist for a few\n\nyears. The leaves in gymnosperms are well-adapted to withstand extremes\n\nof temperature, humidity and wind. In conifers, the needle-like leaves\n\nreduce the surface area. Their thick cuticle and sunken stomata also\n\nhelp to reduce water loss.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPLANT KINGDOM 39\n\nThe gymnosperms are heterosporous; they produce\n\nhaploid microspores and megaspores. The two kinds of\n\nspores are produced within sporangia that are borne\n\non sporophylls which are arranged spirally along an axis\n\nto form lax or compact strobili or cones. The strobili\n\nbearing microsporophylls and microsporangia are\n\ncalled microsporangiate or male strobili. The\n\nmicrospores develop into a male gametophytic\n\ngeneration which is highly reduced and is confined to\n\nonly a limited number of cells. This reduced\n\ngametophyte is called a pollen grain. The development\n\nof pollen grains take place within the microsporangia.\n\nThe cones bearing megasporophylls with ovules or\n\nmegasporangia are called macrosporangiate or female\n\nstrobili. The male or female cones or strobili may be\n\nborne on the same tree (Pinus). However, in cycas male\n\ncones and megasporophylls are borne on different trees.\n\nThe megaspore mother cell is differentiated from one of\n\nthe cells of the nucellus. The nucellus is protected by\n\nenvelopes and the composite structure is called an\n\novule. The ovules are borne on megasporophylls which\n\nmay be clustered to form the female cones. The\n\nmegaspore mother cell divides meiotically to form four\n\nmegaspores. One of the megaspores enclosed within the\n\nmegasporangium develops into a multicellular  female\n\ngametophyte that bears two or more archegonia or\n\nfemale sex organs. The multicellular female gametophyte\n\nis also retained within megasporangium.\n\nUnlike bryophytes and pteridophytes, in\n\ngymnosperms the male and the female gametophytes\n\ndo not have an independent free-living existence. They\n\nremain within the sporangia retained on the\n\nsporophytes. The pollen grain is released from the\n\nmicrosporangium. They are carried in air currents and\n\ncome in contact with the opening of the ovules borne\n\non megasporophylls. The pollen tube carrying the\n\nmale gametes grows towards archegonia in the ovules\n\nand discharge their contents near the mouth of the\n\narchegonia. Following fertilisation, zygote develops\n\ninto an embryo and the ovules into seeds. These seeds\n\nare not covered.\n(c)\n\nFigure 3.4 Gymnosperms: (a) Cycas\n(b) Pinus (c) Ginkgo\n\nDwarf Shoot\n\nLong Shoot\n\nSeeds\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n40 BIOLOGY\n\n3.5 ANGIOSPERMS\n\nUnlike the gymnosperms where the ovules are naked, in the angiosperms\n\nor flowering plants, the pollen grains and ovules are developed in\n\nspecialised structures called flowers. In angiosperms, the seeds are\n\nenclosed in fruits. The angiosperms are an exceptionally large group of\n\nplants occurring in wide range of habitats. They range in size from the\n\nsmallest Wolffia to tall trees of Eucalyptus (over 100 metres). They provide\n\nus with food, fodder,  fuel, medicines and several other commercially\n\nimportant products. They are divided into two classes : the dicotyledons\n\nand the monocotyledons (Figure 3.5). The dicotyledons are\n\ncharacterised by seeds having two cotyledons, reticulate venations in\n\nleaves, and tetramerous or pentamerous flowers, i.e., having four or five\n\nmembers in each floral whorls. The monocotyledons on the other hand\n\nare characterised by single cotyledonous seeds, parallel venation in\n\nleaves, and trimerous flowers having three members in each floral whorls.\n\nThe male sex organ in a flower is the stamen. Each stamen consists of a\n\nslender filament with an anther at the tip. Within the anthers, the pollen\n\nmother cell divide by meiosis to produce microspores which matures\n\ninto pollen grains. The female sex organ in a flower is the pistil. Pistil\n\nconsists of a swollen ovary at its base, a long slender style and stigma.\n\nInside the ovary, ovules are present. Generally each ovule has a\n\nmegaspore mother cell that undergoes meiosis to form four haploid\n\nmegaspores. Three of them degenerate and one divide to form the embryo\n\nsac. Each embryo-sac has a three-celled egg apparatus – one egg cell\n\nand two synergids, three antipodal cells and two polar nuclei. The polar\n\n(b)(a)\n\nFigure 3.5 Angiosperms : (a) A dicotyledon (b) A monocotyledon\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPLANT KINGDOM 41\n\nFigure 3.6  Life cycle of an angiosperm\n\nnuclei eventually fuse to produce a diploid secondary nucleus. Pollen\n\ngrain, after dispersal from the anthers, are carried by wind or various other\n\nagencies to the stigma of a pistil. This is termed as pollination. The pollen\n\ngrains germinate on the stigma and the resulting pollen tubes grow through\n\nthe tissues of stigma and style and reach the ovule. The pollen tubes enter\n\nthe embryo-sac where two male gametes are discharged. One of the male\n\ngametes fuses with the egg cell (syngamy) to form a zygote. The other male\n\ngamete fuses with the diploid secondary nucleus to produce the triploid\n\nprimary endosperm nucleus (PEN). Because of the occurrence of two\n\nfusions i.e., syngamy and triple fusion, this event is termed as double\n\nfertilisation, an event unique to angiosperms. The zygote develops into\n\nan embryo (with one or two cotyledons) and the PEN develops into\n\nendosperm which provides nourishment to  the developing embryo. The\n\nsynergids and antipodals degenerate after fertilisation. During these events\n\nthe ovules develop into seeds and the ovaries develop into fruit. The life\n\ncycle of an angiosperm is shown in Figure 3.6.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n42 BIOLOGY\n\n3.6  PLANT LIFE CYCLES AND ALTERNATION OF\nGENERATIONS\n\nIn plants, both haploid and diploid cells can divide by\n\nmitosis. This ability leads to the formation of different\n\nplant  bodies - haploid and diploid. The haploid plant\n\nbody produces gametes by mitosis. This plant body\n\nrepresents a gametophyte. Following fertilisation the\n\nzygote also divides by mitosis to produce a diploid\n\nsporophytic plant body. Haploid spores are produced\n\nby this plant body by meiosis. These in turn, divide by\n\nmitosis to form a haploid plant body once again. Thus,\n\nduring the life cycle of any sexually reproducing plant,\n\nthere is an alternation of generations between gamete\n\nproducing haploid gametophyte and spore producing\n\ndiploid sporophyte.\n\nHowever, different plant groups, as well as individuals\n\nrepresenting them, differ in the following patterns:\n\n1. Sporophytic generation is represented only by the\n\none-celled zygote. There are no free-living\n\nsporophytes. Meiosis in the zygote results in the\n\nformation of haploid spores. The haploid spores\n\ndivide mitotically and form the gametophyte. The\n\ndominant, photosynthetic phase in such plants is\n\nthe free-living gametophyte. This kind of life cycle\n\nis termed as haplontic. Many algae such as Volvox,\n\nSpirogyra and some species of Chlamydomonas\n\nrepresent this pattern (Figure 3.7 a).\n\n2. On the other extreme, is the type wherein the diploid\n\nsporophyte is the dominant, photosynthetic,\n\nindependent phase of the plant. The gametophytic\n\nphase is represented by the single to few-celled\n\nhaploid gametophyte. This kind of life cycle is\n\ntermed as diplontic. An alga, Fucus sp., represents\n\nthis pattern (Fig. 3.7b). In addition, all seed bearing\n\nplants i.e., gymnosperms and angiosperms, follow\n\nthis pattern with some variations, wherein, the\n\ngametophytic phase is few to multi-celled.\n\n3. Bryophytes and pteridophytes, interestingly, exhibit\n\nan intermediate condition (Haplo-diplontic); both\n\nphases are multicellular. However, they differ in their\n\ndominant phases.\n\nSyngam\ny\n\nZygote\n(2n)\n\nSpores\n(n)\n\nHaplontic\n\nA\n\nB\nGametogenesis\n\nMeiosis\n\nGametophyte\n(n)\n\n(a)\n\nB\n\nA\n\nHaplo-diplontic\nSpores\n\n(n)\n\nMeiosis\n\nGametophyte\n(n)\n\nSyngamy\n\nZygote\n(2n)\n\nGametogenesis\n\nSporophyte\n(2n)\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 3.7 Life cycle patterns : (a) Haplontic\n(b) Diplontic  (c) Haplo-diplontic\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPLANT KINGDOM 43\n\nSUMMARY\n\nPlant kingdom includes algae, bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms and\n\nangiosperms. Algae are chlorophyll-bearing simple, thalloid, autotrophic and\n\nlargely aquatic organisms. Depending on the type of pigment possesed and the\n\ntype of stored food, algae are classfied into three classes, namely Chlorophyceae,\n\nPhaeophyceae and Rhodophyceae. Algae usually reproduce vegetatively by\n\nfragmentation, asexually by formation of different types of spores and sexually by\n\nformation of gametes which may show isogamy, anisogamy or oogamy.\n\nBryophytes are plants which can live in soil but are dependent on water for\n\nsexual reproduction. Their plant body is more differentiated than that of algae. It\n\nis thallus-like and prostrate or erect and attached to the substratum by rhizoids.\n\nThey possess root-like, leaf-like and stem-like structures. The bryophytes are\n\ndivided into liverworts and mosses. The plant body of liverworts is thalloid and\n\ndorsiventral whereas mosses have upright, slender axes bearing spirally arranged\n\nleaves. The main plant body of a bryophyte is gamete-producing and is called a\n\ngametophyte. It bears the male sex organs called antheridia  and female sex organs\n\ncalled archegonia. The male and female gametes produced fuse to form zygote\n\nwhich produces a multicellular body called a sporophyte. It produces haploid\n\nspores. The spores germinate to form gametophytes.\n\nIn pteridophytes the main plant is a sporophyte which is differentiated into\n\ntrue root, stem and leaves. These organs possess well-differentiated vascular\n\ntissues. The sporophytes bear sporangia which produce spores. The spores\n\ngerminate to form  gametophytes which require cool, damp places to grow. The\n\ngametophytes bear male and female sex organs called antheridia and archegonia,\n\nrespectively. Water is required for transfer of male gametes to archegonium where\n\nzygote is formed after fertilisation. The zygote produces a sporophyte.\n\nA dominant, independent, photosynthetic, thalloid or erect phase is\n\nrepresented by a haploid gametophyte and it alternates with the short-\n\nlived multicelluler sporophyte totally or partially dependent on the\n\ngametophyte for its anchorage and nutrition. All bryophytes represent\n\nthis pattern.\n\nThe diploid sporophyte is represented by a dominant, independent,\n\nphotosynthetic, vascular plant body. It alternates with multicellular,\n\nsaprophytic/autotrophic, independent but short-lived haploid\n\ngametophyte. Such a pattern is known as haplo-diplontic life cycle. All\n\npteridophytes exhibit this pattern (Figure 3.7 c).\n\nInterestingly, while most algal genera are haplontic, some of them\n\nsuch as Ectocarpus, Polysiphonia, kelps are haplo-diplontic. Fucus, an\n\nalga is diplontic.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n44 BIOLOGY\n\nThe gymnosperms are the plants in which ovules are not enclosed by any\n\novary wall. After fertilisation the seeds remain exposed and therefore these plants\n\nare called naked-seeded plants. The gymnosperms produce microspores and\n\nmegaspores which are produced in microsporangia and megasporangia borne on\n\nthe sporophylls. The sporophylls – microsporophylls and megasporophylls – are\n\narranged spirally on axis to form male and female cones, respectively. The pollen\n\ngrain germinates and pollen tube releases the male gamete into the ovule, where it\n\nfuses with the egg cell in archegonia. Following fertilisation, the zygote develops\n\ninto embryo and the ovules into seeds.\n\nIn angiosperms, the male sex organs (stamen) and female sex organs (pistil)\n\nare borne in a flower. Each stamen consists of a filament and an anther. The anther\n\nproduces pollen grains (male gametophyte) after meiosis. The pistil consists of an\n\novary enclosing one to many ovules. Within the ovule is the female gametophyte\n\nor embryo sac which contains the egg cell. The pollen tube enters the embryo-sac\n\nwhere two male gametes are discharged. One male gamete fuses with egg cell\n\n(syngamy) and other fuses with diploid secondary nucleus (triple fusion). This\n\nphenomenon of two fusions is called double fertilisation and is unique to\n\nangiosperms. The angiosperms are divided into two classes – the dicotyledons\n\nand the monocotyledons.\n\nDuring the life cycle of any sexually reproducing plant, there is alternation of\n\ngenerations between gamete producing haploid gametophyte and spore producing\n\ndiploid sporophyte. However, different plant groups as well as individuals may\n\nshow different patterns of life cycles – haplontic, diplontic or intermediate.\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1.

As over a million species of animals have been\n\ndescribed till now, the need for classification becomes all the more\n\nimportant. The classification also helps in assigning a systematic position\n\nto newly described species.\n\n4.1 BASIS OF CLASSIFICATION\n\nInspite of differences in structure and form of different animals, there are\n\nfundamental features common to various individuals in relation to the\n\narrangement of cells, body symmetry, nature of coelom, patterns of\n\ndigestive, circulatory or reproductive systems. These features are used\n\nas the basis of animal classification and some of them are discussed here.\n\n4.1.1 Levels of Organisation\n\nThough all members of Animalia are multicellular, all of them do not\n\nexhibit the same pattern of organisation of cells. For example, in sponges,\n\nthe cells are arranged as loose cell aggregates, i.e., they exhibit cellular\n\nlevel of organisation. Some division of labour (activities) occur among\n\nthe cells. In coelenterates, the arrangement of cells is more complex. Here\n\nthe cells performing the same function are arranged into tissues, hence is\n\ncalled tissue level of organisation. A still higher level of organisation, i.e.,\n\norgan level is exhibited by members of Platyhelminthes and other higher\n\nphyla where tissues are grouped together to form organs, each specialised\n\nfor a particular function. In animals like Annelids, Arthropods, Molluscs,\n\nANIMAL KINGDOM\n\nCHAPTER  4\n\n4.1 Basis of\n\nClassification\n\n4.2 Classification of\n\nAnimals\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nANIMAL KINGDOM 4747ANIMAL KINGDOM\n\nEchinoderms and Chordates, organs have\n\nassociated to form functional systems, each\n\nsystem concerned with a specific physiological\n\nfunction. This pattern is called organ system\n\nlevel of organisation. Organ systems in different\n\ngroups of animals exhibit various patterns of\n\ncomplexities. For example, the digestive system\n\nin Platyhelminthes has only a single opening\n\nto the outside of the body that serves as both\n\nmouth and anus, and is hence called\n\nincomplete. A complete digestive system has\n\ntwo openings, mouth and anus. Similarly, the\n\ncirculatory system may be of two types:\n\n(i) open type in which the blood is pumped\n\nout of the heart and the cells and tissues are\n\ndirectly bathed in it and\n\n(ii) closed type in which the blood is circulated\n\nthrough a series of vessels of varying diameters\n\n(arteries, veins and capillaries).\n\n4.1.2 Symmetry\n\nAnimals can be categorised on the basis of their\n\nsymmetry. Sponges are mostly  asymmetrical,\n\ni.e., any plane that passes through the centre\n\ndoes not divide them into equal halves. When\n\nany plane passing through the central axis of\n\nthe body divides the organism into two identical\n\nhalves, it is called radial symmetry.\n\nCoelenterates, ctenophores and echinoderms\n\nhave this kind of body plan (Figure 4.1a).\n\nAnimals like annelids, arthropods, etc., where\n\nthe body can be divided into identical left and\n\nright halves in only one plane, exhibit bilateral\n\nsymmetry (Figure 4.1b).\n\n4.1.3 Diploblastic and Triploblastic\nOrganisation\n\nAnimals in which the cells are arranged in two\n\nembryonic layers, an external ectoderm and\n\nan internal endoderm, are called diploblastic\n\nanimals, e.g., coelenterates. An undifferentiated\n\nlayer, mesoglea, is present in between the\n\nectoderm and the endoderm (Figure 4.2a).\n\nFigure 4.2 Showing germinal layers :\n(a) Diploblastic (b) Triploblastic\n\n(a) (b)\n\nEctoderm\nMesoglea\n\nEndoderm\n\nMesoderm\n\nFigure 4.1 (b) Bilateral symmetry\n\nFigure 4.1 (a)  Radial symmetry\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n48 BIOLOGY\n\n4.1.4 Coelom\n\nPresence or absence of a cavity between the body\n\nwall and the gut wall is very important in\n\nclassification. The body cavity, which is lined\n\nby mesoderm is called coelom. Animals\n\npossessing coelom are called coelomates, e.g.,\n\nannelids, molluscs, arthropods, echinoderms,\n\nhemichordates and chordates (Figure 4.3a). In\n\nsome animals, the body cavity is not lined by\n\nmesoderm, instead, the mesoderm is present as\n\nscattered pouches in between the ectoderm and\n\nendoderm. Such a body cavity is called\n\npseudocoelom and the animals possessing them\n\nare called pseudocoelomates, e.g.,\n\naschelminthes (Figure 4.3b). The animals in\n\nwhich the body cavity is absent are called\n\nacoelomates, e.g., platyhelminthes (Figure 4.3c).\nFigure 4.3 Diagrammatic sectional view of :\n\n(a) Coelomate (b) Pseudocoelomate\n(c) Acoelomate\n\nThose animals in which the developing embryo has a third germinal layer,\n\nmesoderm, in between the ectoderm and endoderm, are called\n\ntriploblastic animals (platyhelminthes to chordates, Figure 4.2b).\n\n4.1.5 Segmentation\n\nIn some animals, the body is externally and internally divided into\n\nsegments with a serial repetition of at least some organs. For example, in\n\nearthworm, the body shows this pattern called metameric segmentation\n\nand the phenomenon is known as metamerism.\n\n4.1.6 Notochord\n\nNotochord is a mesodermally derived rod-like structure formed on the\n\ndorsal side during embryonic development in some animals. Animals with\n\nnotochord are called chordates and those animals which do not form this\n\nstructure are called non-chordates, e.g., porifera to echinoderms.\n\n4.2 CLASSIFICATION OF ANIMALS\n\nThe broad classification of Animalia based on common fundamental\n\nfeatures as mentioned in the preceding sections is given in Figure  4.4.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nANIMAL KINGDOM 4949ANIMAL KINGDOM\n\nThe important characteristic features of the\n\ndifferent phyla are described.\n\n4.2.1 Phylum – Porifera\n\nMembers of this phylum are commonly known\n\nas sponges. They are generally marine and mostly\n\nasymmetrical animals (Figure 4.5). These are\n\nprimitive multicellular animals and have cellular\n\nlevel of organisation. Sponges have a water\n\ntransport or canal system. Water enters through\n\nminute pores (ostia) in the body wall into a central\n\ncavity, spongocoel, from where it goes out\n\nthrough the osculum. This pathway of water\n\ntransport is helpful in food gathering, respiratory\n\nexchange and removal of waste. Choanocytes\n\nor collar cells line the spongocoel and the canals.\n\nDigestion is intracellular. The body is supported\n\nby a skeleton made up of spicules or spongin\n\nfibres. Sexes are not separate (hermaphrodite),\n\ni.e., eggs and sperms are produced by the same\n\nindividual. Sponges reproduce asexually by\n\nfragmentation and sexually by formation of\n\ngametes. Fertilisation is internal and development\n\nis indirect having a larval stage which is\n\nmorphologically distinct from the adult.\n\n*Echinodermata exhibits radial or bilateral symmetry depending on the stage.\n\nFigure 4.4  Broad classification of Kingdom Animalia based on common fundamental features\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 4.5 Examples of Porifera : (a) Sycon\n(b) Euspongia  (c) Spongilla\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n50 BIOLOGY\n\ncnidoblasts or cnidocytes (which contain the stinging capsules or\n\nnematocysts) present on the tentacles and the body. Cnidoblasts are used\n\nfor anchorage, defense and for the capture of prey (Figure 4.7). Cnidarians\n\nexhibit tissue level of organisation and are diploblastic. They have a central\n\ngastro-vascular cavity with a single opening, mouth on hypostome.\n\nDigestion is extracellular and intracellular. Some of the cnidarians, e.g.,\n\ncorals have a skeleton composed of calcium carbonate. Cnidarians exhibit\n\ntwo basic body forms called polyp and medusa (Figure 4.6). The former\n\nis a sessile and cylindrical form like Hydra, Adamsia, etc. whereas, the\n\nlatter is umbrella-shaped and free-swimming like Aurelia or jelly fish.\n\nThose cnidarians which exist in both forms exhibit alternation of\n\ngeneration (Metagenesis), i.e., polyps produce medusae asexually and\n\nmedusae form the polyps sexually (e.g., Obelia).\n\nExamples: Physalia (Portuguese man-of-war), Adamsia (Sea anemone),\n\nPennatula (Sea-pen), Gorgonia (Sea-fan) and Meandrina (Brain coral).\n\nFigure 4.7\nDiagrammatic view of\nCnidoblast\n\nFigure 4.6 Examples of  Coelenterata indicating outline of their body form :\n(a) Aurelia (Medusa) (b) Adamsia (Polyp)\n\n(b)(a)\n\nExamples: Sycon (Scypha), Spongilla (Fresh water sponge) and Euspongia\n\n(Bath sponge).\n\n4.2.2 Phylum – Coelenterata (Cnidaria)\n\nThey are aquatic, mostly marine, sessile or free-swimming, radially\n\nsymmetrical animals (Figure 4.6). The name cnidaria is derived from the\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nANIMAL KINGDOM 5151ANIMAL KINGDOM\n\n4.2.3 Phylum – Ctenophora\n\nCtenophores, commonly known as sea walnuts or comb jellies\n\nare exclusively marine, radially symmetrical, diploblastic\n\norganisms with tissue level of organisation. The body bears\n\neight external rows of ciliated comb plates, which help in\n\nlocomotion (Figure 4.8). Digestion is both extracellular and\n\nintracellular. Bioluminescence (the property of a living\n\norganism to emit light) is well-marked in ctenophores. Sexes\n\nare not separate. Reproduction takes place only by sexual\n\nmeans. Fertilisation is external with indirect development.\n\nExamples: Pleurobrachia and Ctenoplana.\n\n4.2.4 Phylum – Platyhelminthes\n\nThey have dorso-ventrally flattened body, hence are called\n\nflatworms (Figure 4.9). These are mostly endoparasites found\n\nin animals including human beings. Flatworms are bilaterally\n\nsymmetrical, triploblastic and acoelomate animals with organ\n\nlevel of organisation. Hooks and suckers are present in the\n\nparasitic forms. Some of them absorb nutrients from the host\n\ndirectly through their body surface. Specialised cells called\n\nflame cells help in osmoregulation and excretion. Sexes are not\n\nseparate. Fertilisation is internal and development is through\n\nmany larval stages. Some members like Planaria possess high\n\nregeneration capacity.\n\nExamples: Taenia (Tapeworm), Fasciola (Liver fluke).\n\nFigure 4.8 Example of\nCtenophora\n(Pleurobrachia)\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 4.9 Examples of Platyhelminthes : (a) Tape worm (b) Liver fluke\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n52 BIOLOGY\n\n4.2.5 Phylum – Aschelminthes\n\nThe body of the aschelminthes is circular in\n\ncross-section, hence, the name roundworms\n\n(Figure 4.10). They may be freeliving, aquatic\n\nand terrestrial or parasitic in plants and animals.\n\nRoundworms have organ-system level of body\n\norganisation. They are bilaterally symmetrical,\n\ntriploblastic and pseudocoelomate animals.\n\nAlimentary canal is complete with a well-\n\ndeveloped muscular pharynx. An excretory\n\ntube removes body wastes from the body cavity\n\nthrough the excretory pore. Sexes are separate\n\n(dioecious), i.e., males and females are distinct.\n\nOften females are longer than males. Fertilisation\n\nis internal and development may be direct (the\n\nyoung ones resemble the adult) or indirect.\n\nExamples : Ascaris (Roundworm), Wuchereria\n\n(Filaria worm), Ancylostoma (Hookworm).\n\n4.2.6 Phylum – Annelida\n\nThey may be aquatic (marine and fresh water) or\n\nterrestrial; free-living, and sometimes parasitic.\n\nThey exhibit organ-system level of body\n\norganisation and bilateral symmetry. They are\n\ntriploblastic, metamerically segmented and\n\ncoelomate animals. Their body surface is\n\ndistinctly marked out into segments or\n\nmetameres and, hence, the phylum name\n\nAnnelida (Latin, annulus : little ring) (Figure 4.11).\n\nThey possess longitudinal and circular muscles\n\nwhich help in locomotion. Aquatic annelids like\n\nNereis possess lateral appendages, parapodia,\n\nwhich help in swimming. A closed circulatory\n\nsystem is present. Nephridia (sing. nephridium)\n\nhelp in osmoregulation and excretion. Neural\n\nsystem consists of paired ganglia (sing. ganglion)\n\nconnected by lateral nerves to a double ventral\n\nnerve cord. Nereis, an aquatic form, is dioecious,\n\nbut earthworms and leeches are monoecious.\n\nReproduction is sexual.\n\nExamples : Nereis, Pheretima (Earthworm) and\n\nHirudinaria (Blood sucking leech).\nFigure 4.11 Examples of Annelida : (a) Nereis\n\n(b) Hirudinaria\n\nMale Female\n\nFigure 4.10 Example of\nAschelminthes:\nRoundworm\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nANIMAL KINGDOM 5353ANIMAL KINGDOM\n\n4.2.7 Phylum – Arthropoda\n\nThis is the largest phylum of Animalia which\n\nincludes insects. Over two-thirds of all named\n\nspecies on earth are arthropods (Figure 4.12).\n\nThey have organ-system level of organisation.\n\nThey are bilaterally symmetrical, triploblastic,\n\nsegmented and coelomate animals. The body\n\nof arthropods is covered by chitinous\n\nexoskeleton. The body consists of head, thorax\n\nand abdomen. They have jointed appendages\n\n(arthros-joint, poda-appendages). Respiratory\n\norgans are gills, book gills, book lungs or\n\ntracheal system. Circulatory system is of open\n\ntype. Sensory organs like antennae, eyes\n\n(compound and simple), statocysts or\n\nbalancing organs are present.  Excretion takes\n\nplace through malpighian tubules. They are\n\nmostly dioecious. Fertilisation is usually\n\ninternal. They are mostly oviparous.\n\nDevelopment may be direct or indirect.\n\nExamples: Economically important insects –\n\nApis (Honey bee), Bombyx (Silkworm), Laccifer\n\n(Lac insect)\n\nVectors – Anopheles, Culex and Aedes\n\n(Mosquitoes)\n\nGregarious pest – Locusta (Locust)\n\nLiving fossil – Limulus (King crab).\n\n4.2.8 Phylum – Mollusca\n\nThis is the second largest animal phylum\n\n(Figure 4.13). Molluscs are terrestrial or aquatic\n\n(marine or fresh water) having an organ-system\n\nlevel of organisation. They are bilaterally\n\nsymmetrical, triploblastic and coelomate\n\nanimals. Body is covered by a calcareous shell\n\nand is unsegmented with a distinct head,\n\nmuscular foot and visceral hump. A soft and\n\nspongy layer of skin forms a mantle over the\n\nvisceral hump. The space between the hump\n\nand the mantle is called the mantle cavity in\n\nwhich feather like gills are present. They have\n\nrespiratory and excretory functions. The\n\nanterior head region has sensory tentacles. The\n\nmouth contains a file-like rasping organ for\n\nfeeding, called radula.\n\nFigure 4.12 Examples of Arthropoda :\n(a) Locust (b) Butterfly\n(c) Scorpion (d) Prawn\n\n (a)\n\n (c)\n\n (b)\n\n (d)\n\nFigure 4.13 Examples of Mollusca :\n(a) Pila  (b) Octopus\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n54 BIOLOGY\n\nThey are usually dioecious and oviparous with indirect\n\ndevelopment.\n\nExamples: Pila (Apple snail), Pinctada (Pearl oyster), Sepia\n\n(Cuttlefish), Loligo (Squid), Octopus (Devil fish), Aplysia (Sea-\n\nhare), Dentalium (Tusk shell) and Chaetopleura (Chiton).\n\n4.2.9 Phylum – Echinodermata\n\nThese animals have an endoskeleton of calcareous ossicles\n\nand, hence, the name Echinodermata (Spiny bodied, Figure\n\n4.14). All are marine with organ-system level of organisation.\n\nThe adult echinoderms are radially symmetrical but larvae\n\nare bilaterally symmetrical. They are triploblastic and\n\ncoelomate animals. Digestive system is complete with mouth\n\non the lower (ventral) side and anus on the upper (dorsal)\n\nside. The most distinctive feature of echinoderms is the\n\npresence of water vascular system which helps in\n\nlocomotion, capture and transport of food and respiration.\n\nAn excretory system is absent. Sexes are separate.\n\nReproduction is sexual. Fertilisation is usually external.\n\nDevelopment is indirect with free-swimming larva.\n\nExamples: Asterias (Star fish), Echinus (Sea urchin), Antedon\n\n(Sea lily), Cucumaria (Sea cucumber) and Ophiura (Brittle star).\n\n4.2.10 Phylum – Hemichordata\n\nHemichordata was earlier considered as a sub-phylum under\n\nphylum Chordata. But now it is placed as a separate phylum\n\nunder non-chordata. Hemichordates have a rudimentary\n\nstructure in the collar region called stomochord, a structure\n\nsimilar to notochord.\n\nThis phylum consists of a small group of worm-like\n\nmarine animals with organ-system level of organisation. They\n\nare bilaterally symmetrical, triploblastic and coelomate\n\nanimals. The body is cylindrical and is composed of an\n\nanterior proboscis, a collar and a long trunk (Figure 4.15).\n\nCirculatory system is of  open type. Respiration takes place\n\nthrough gills. Excretory organ is proboscis gland. Sexes are\n\nseparate. Fertilisation is external. Development is indirect.\n\nExamples: Balanoglossus and Saccoglossus.\n\n4.2.11 Phylum – Chordata\n\nAnimals belonging to phylum Chordata are fundamentally\n\ncharacterised by the presence of a notochord, a dorsal\n\nFigure 4.14 Examples of\nEchinodermata :\n(a) Asterias\n(b) Ophiura\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 4.15 Balanoglossus\n\nProboscis\n\nCollar\n\nTrunk\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nANIMAL KINGDOM 5555ANIMAL KINGDOM\n\nhollow nerve cord and paired pharyngeal\n\ngill slits (Figure 4.16). These are bilaterally\n\nsymmetrical, triploblastic,  coelomate with\n\norgan-system level of organisation. They\n\npossess a post anal tail and a closed circulatory\n\nsystem.\n\nTable 4.1 presents a comparison of salient\n\nfeatures of chordates and non-chordates.\n\nPhylum Chordata is divided into three\n\nsubphyla: Urochordata or Tunicata,\n\nCephalochordata and Vertebrata.\n\nSubphyla Urochordata and\n\nCephalochordata are often referred to as\n\nprotochordates (Figure 4.17) and are\n\nexclusively marine. In Urochordata, notochord\n\nis present only in larval tail, while in\n\nCephalochordata, it extends from head to tail\n\nregion and is persistent throughout their life.\n\nExamples: Urochordata – Ascidia, Salpa,\n\nDoliolum; Cephalochordata – Branchiostoma\n\n(Amphioxus or Lancelet).\n\nThe members of subphylum Vertebrata\n\npossess notochord during the embryonic\n\nperiod. The notochord is replaced by a\n\ncartilaginous or bony vertebral column in the\n\nadult. Thus all vertebrates are chordates but\n\nall chordates are not vertebrates. Besides the\n\nbasic chordate characters, vertebrates have a\n\nventral muscular heart with two, three or four\n\nchambers, kidneys for excretion and\n\nosmoregulation and paired appendages which\n\nmay be fins or limbs.\n\nNerve cord Notochord\n\nPost-anal part\n\nGill slits\n\nFigure 4.16  Chordata characteristics\n\nFigure 4.17  Ascidia\n\nTABLE 4.1 Comparison of Chordates and Non-chordates\n\nS.No. Chordates Non-chordates\n\n1.

They have an\n\nelongated body bearing 6-15 pairs of gill slits\n\nfor respiration. Cyclostomes have a sucking and\n\ncircular mouth without jaws (Fig. 4.18). Their\n\nbody is devoid of scales and paired fins.\n\nCranium and vertebral column are\n\ncartilaginous. Circulation is of closed type.\n\nCyclostomes are marine but migrate for\n\nspawning to fresh water. After spawning, within\n\na few days, they die. Their larvae, after\n\nmetamorphosis, return to the ocean.\n\nExamples: Petromyzon (Lamprey) and Myxine\n\n(Hagfish).\n\n4.2.11.2 Class – Chondrichthyes\n\nThey are marine animals with streamlined body\n\nand have cartilaginous endoskeleton\n\n(Figure 4.19). Mouth is located ventrally.\n\nNotochord is persistent throughout life. Gill\n\nslits are separate and without operculum (gill\n\ncover). The skin is tough, containing minute\n\nplacoid scales. Teeth are modified placoid\n\nscales which are backwardly directed. Their\n\njaws are very powerful. These animals are\n\npredaceous.  Due to the absence of air bladder,\n\nthey have to swim constantly to avoid sinking.\n\nVertebrata\n\nDivision\n\nAgnatha\n(lacks jaw)\n\nClass\n1.

They are\n\ncold-blooded (poikilothermous) animals, i.e., they lack\n\nthe capacity to regulate their body temperature. Sexes\n\nare separate. In males pelvic fins bear claspers. They\n\nhave internal fertilisation and many of them are\n\nviviparous.\n\nExamples: Scoliodon (Dog fish),  Pristis (Saw fish),\n\nCarcharodon (Great white shark), Trygon (Sting ray).\n\n4.2.11.3 Class – Osteichthyes\n\nIt includes both marine and fresh water fishes with bony\n\nendoskeleton. Their body is streamlined. Mouth is\n\nmostly terminal (Figure 4.20). They have four pairs of\n\ngills which are covered by an operculum on each side.\n\nSkin is covered with cycloid/ctenoid scales. Air bladder\n\nis present which regulates buoyancy. Heart is two-\n\nchambered (one auricle and one ventricle). They are\n\ncold-blooded animals. Sexes are separate. Fertilisation\n\nis usually external. They are mostly oviparous and\n\ndevelopment is direct.\n\nExamples: Marine – Exocoetus (Flying fish),\n\nHippocampus (Sea horse); Freshwater – Labeo (Rohu),\n\nCatla (Katla), Clarias (Magur); Aquarium  – Betta\n\n(Fighting fish), Pterophyllum (Angel fish).\n\n4.2.11.4 Class – Amphibia\n\nAs the name indicates (Gr., Amphi : dual, bios, life),\n\namphibians can live in aquatic as well as terrestrial\n\nhabitats (Figure 4.21). Most of them have two pairs of\n\nlimbs. Body is divisible into head and trunk. Tail may\n\nbe present in some. The amphibian skin is moist\n\n(without scales). The eyes have eyelids. A tympanum\n\nrepresents the ear. Alimentary canal, urinary and\n\nreproductive tracts open into a common chamber called\n\ncloaca which opens to the exterior. Respiration is by\n\ngills, lungs and through skin. The heart is three-\n\nchambered (two auricles and one ventricle). These are\n\ncold-blooded animals. Sexes are separate. Fertilisation\n\nis external. They are oviparous and development\n\nis indirect.\n\nExamples: Bufo (Toad), Rana (Frog), Hyla (Tree frog),\n\nSalamandra (Salamander), Ichthyophis (Limbless\n\namphibia).\n\nFigure 4.21 Examples of Amphibia :\n(a) Salamandra\n(b) Rana\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 4.20 Examples of Bony fishes :\n(a) Hippocampus (b) Catla\n\n(b)(a)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n58 BIOLOGY\n\n4.2.11.5 Class – Reptilia\n\nThe class name refers to their creeping or crawling mode of locomotion\n\n(Latin, repere or reptum, to creep or crawl). They are mostly terrestrial\n\nanimals and their body is covered by dry and cornified skin, epidermal\n\nscales or scutes (Fig. 4.22). They do not have external ear openings.\n\nTympanum represents ear.  Limbs, when present, are two pairs. Heart is\n\nusually three-chambered, but four-chambered in crocodiles. Reptiles are\n\npoikilotherms. Snakes and lizards shed their scales as skin cast.  Sexes\n\nare separate. Fertilisation is internal. They are oviparous and development\n\nis direct.\n\nExamples: Chelone (Turtle), Testudo (Tortoise), Chameleon (Tree lizard),\n\nCalotes (Garden lizard), Crocodilus (Crocodile), Alligator (Alligator).\n\nHemidactylus (Wall lizard), Poisonous snakes – Naja (Cobra), Bangarus\n\n(Krait), Vipera (Viper).\n\n4.2.11.6 Class – Aves\n\nThe characteristic features of Aves (birds) are the presence of feathers\n\nand most of them can fly except flightless birds (e.g., Ostrich). They possess\n\nbeak (Figure 4.23). The forelimbs are modified into wings. The hind limbs\n\ngenerally have scales and are modified for walking, swimming or clasping\n\nthe tree branches. Skin is dry without glands except the oil gland at the\n\nbase of the tail. Endoskeleton is fully ossified (bony) and the long bones\n\nare hollow with air cavities (pneumatic). The digestive tract of birds has\n\nadditional chambers, the crop and gizzard. Heart is completely four-\n\nchambered. They are warm-blooded (homoiothermous) animals, i.e.,\n\nthey are able to maintain a constant body temperature.

Besides the fundamental features, there are many\n\nother distinctive characters which are specific for each phyla or class.\n\nPorifera includes multicellular animals which exhibit cellular level of\n\norganisation and have characteristic flagellated choanocytes. The coelenterates\n\nhave tentacles and bear cnidoblasts. They are mostly aquatic, sessile or free-floating.\n\nThe ctenophores are marine animals with comb plates. The platyhelminths have\n\nflat body and exhibit bilateral symmetry. The parasitic forms show distinct suckers\n\nand hooks. Aschelminthes are pseudocoelomates and  include parasitic as well as\n\nnon-parasitic roundworms.\n\nAnnelids are metamerically segmented animals with a true coelom. The\n\narthropods are the most abundant group of animals characterised by the presence\n\nof jointed appendages. The molluscs have a soft body surrounded by an external\n\ncalcareous shell. The body is covered with external skeleton made of chitin. The\n\nechinoderms possess a spiny skin. Their most distinctive feature is the presence\n\nof water vascular system. The hemichordates are a small group of worm-like marine\n\nanimals. They have a cylindrical body with proboscis, collar and trunk.\n\nPhylum Chordata includes animals which possess a notochord either\n\nthroughout or during early embryonic life. Other common features observed in\n\nthe chordates are the dorsal, hollow nerve cord and paired pharyngeal gill slits.\n\nSome of the vertebrates do not possess jaws (Agnatha) whereas most of them possess\n\njaws (Gnathostomata). Agnatha is represented by the class, Cyclostomata. They\n\nare the most primitive chordates and are ectoparasites on fishes. Gnathostomata\n\nhas two super classes, Pisces and Tetrapoda. Classes Chondrichthyes and\n\nOsteichthyes bear fins for locomotion and are grouped under Pisces. The\n\nChondrichthyes are fishes with cartilaginous endoskeleton and are marine. Classes,\n\nAmphibia, Reptilia, Aves and Mammalia have two pairs of limbs and are thus\n\ngrouped under Tetrapoda. The amphibians have adapted to live both on land and\n\nwater. Reptiles are characterised by the presence of dry and cornified skin. Limbs\n\nare absent in snakes. Fishes, amphibians and reptiles are poikilothermous (cold-\n\nblooded). Aves are warm-blooded animals with feathers on their bodies and\n\nforelimbs modified into wings for flying. Hind limbs are adapted for walking,\n\nswimming, perching or clasping. The unique features of mammals are the presence\n\nof mammary glands and hairs on the skin. They commonly exhibit viviparity.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n62 BIOLOGY\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1.

This description is mainly of gross structural features,\nboth external and internal. In addition, observable and perceivable\nliving phenomena were also recorded as part of this description. Before\nexperimental biology or more specifically, physiology, was established\nas a part of biology, naturalists described only biology. Hence, biology\nremained as a natural history for a long time. The description, by itself,\nwas amazing in terms of detail. While the initial reaction of a student\ncould be boredom, one should keep in mind  that the detailed description,\nwas utilised in the later day reductionist biology where living processes\ndrew more attention from scientists than the description of life forms\nand their structure. Hence, this description became meaningful and\nhelpful in framing research questions in physiology or evolutionary\nbiology. In the following chapters of this unit, the structural organisation\nof plants and animals, including the structural basis of physiologial or\nbehavioural phenomena, is described. For convenience, this description\nof morphological and anatomical features is presented separately for\nplants and animals.\n\nSTRUCTURAL ORGANISATION\n\nIN PLANTS AND ANIMALS\n\nChapter 5\nMorphology of\nFlowering Plants\n\nChapter 6\nAnatomy of Flowering\nPlants\n\nChapter 7\nStructural Organisation in\nAnimals\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nKATHERINE ESAU was born in Ukraine in 1898. She  studied\nagriculture in Russia and Germany and received her doctorate\nin 1931 in United States. She reported in her early publications\nthat the curly top virus spreads through a plant via the food-\nconducting or phloem tissue. Dr Esau’s Plant Anatomy published\nin 1954 took a dynamic, developmental approach designed to\nenhance one’s understanding of plant structure and an\nenormous impact worldwide, literally bringing about a revival\nof the discipline. The Anatomy of Seed Plants by Katherine Esau\nwas published in 1960. It was referred to as Webster’s of plant\nbiology – it is encyclopediac. In 1957 she was elected to the\nNational Academy of Sciences, becoming the sixth woman to\nreceive that honour. In addition to this prestigious award, she\nreceived the National Medal of Science from President George\nBush in 1989.\n\nWhen Katherine Esau died in the year 1997, Peter Raven,\ndirector of Anatomy and Morphology, Missouri Botanical\nGarden, remembered that she  ‘absolutely dominated’ the field\nof plant biology even at the age of 99.\n\nKatherine Esau\n(1898 – 1997)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nThe wide range in the structure of higher plants will never fail to fascinate\n\nus. Even though the angiosperms show such a large diversity in external\n\nstructure or morphology, they are all characterised by presence of roots,\n\nstems, leaves, flowers and fruits.\n\nIn chapters 2 and 3, we talked about classification of plants based\n\non morphological and other characteristics. For any successful attempt\n\nat classification and at understanding any higher plant (or for that\n\nmatter any living organism) we need to know standard technical terms\n\nand  standard definitions. We also need to know about the possible\n\nvariations in different parts, found as adaptations of the plants to their\n\nenvironment, e.g., adaptions to various habitats, for protection,\n\nclimbing, storage, etc.\n\nIf you pull out any weed you will see that all of them have roots, stems\n\nand leaves. They may be bearing flowers and fruits. The underground\n\npart of the flowering plant is the root system while the portion above the\n\nground  forms the shoot system (Figure 5.1).\n\n5.1 THE ROOT\n\nIn majority of the dicotyledonous plants, the direct elongation of the radicle\n\nleads to the formation of primary root which grows inside the soil.\n\nIt bears lateral roots of several orders that are referred to as secondary,\n\ntertiary, etc. roots. The primary roots and its branches constitute the\n\nMORPHOLOGY OF FLOWERING PLANTS\n\nCHAPTER  5\n\n5.1 The Root\n\n5.2  The Stem\n\n5.3 The Leaf\n\n5.4 The Inflorescence\n\n5.5 The Flower\n\n5.6 The Fruit\n\n5.7 The Seed\n\n5.8 Semi-technical\n\nDescription of a\n\nTypical\n\nFlowering Plant\n\n5.9 Description of\n\nSome Important\n\nFamilies\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n66 BIOLOGY\n\nFlower\n\nShoot\nsystem\n\nRoot\nsystem\n\nFruit\n\nBud\n\nStem\n\nLeaf\n\nNode\n\nInternode\n\nPrimary\nroot\n\nSecondary\nroot\n\n{\n\nFigure 5.2 Different types of roots : (a) Tap  (b) Fibrous  (c) Adventitious\n\n(c)(b)\n\nFigure 5.1  Parts of a flowering plant\n\nFibrous roots Adventitious roots\n\nLaterals\n\n(a)\n\nMain root\n\ntap root system, as seen in the mustard\n\nplant (Figure 5.2a). In monocotyledonous\n\nplants, the primary root is short lived and\n\nis replaced by a large number of roots.\n\nThese roots originate from the base of the\n\nstem and constitute the fibrous root\n\nsystem, as seen in the wheat plant (Figure\n\n5.2b). In some plants, like grass,\n\nMonstera and the banyan tree, roots arise\n\nfrom parts of the plant other than the\n\nradicle and are called adventitious roots\n\n(Figure 5.2c). The main functions of the\n\nroot system are absorption of water and\n\nminerals from the soil, providing a proper\n\nanchorage to the plant parts, storing\n\nreserve food material and synthesis of\n\nplant growth regulators.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMORPHOLOGY OF FLOWERING PLANTS 67\n\n5.1.1 Regions of the Root\n\nThe root is covered at the apex by a thimble-like\n\nstructure called the root cap (Figure 5.3). It\n\nprotects the tender apex of the root as it makes\n\nits way through the soil. A few millimetres above\n\nthe root cap is the region of meristematic\n\nactivity.  The cells of this region are very small,\n\nthin-walled and with dense protoplasm. They\n\ndivide repeatedly. The cells proximal to this\n\nregion undergo rapid elongation and\n\nenlargement and are responsible for the growth\n\nof the root in length. This region is called the\n\nregion of elongation. The cells of the elongation\n\nzone gradually differentiate and mature. Hence,\n\nthis zone, proximal to region of elongation, is\n\ncalled the region of maturation.  From this\n\nregion some of the epidermal cells form very fine\n\nand delicate, thread-like structures called root\n\nhairs. These root hairs absorb water and\n\nminerals from the soil.\n\n5.1.2 Modifications of Root\n\nRoots in some plants change their shape and\n\nstructure and become modified to perform\n\nfunctions other than absorption and\n\nconduction of water and minerals. They are\n\nmodified for support, storage of food and\n\nrespiration (Figure 5.4 and 5.5). Tap roots of\n\ncarrot, turnip and adventitious roots of sweet\n\npotato, get swollen and store food. Can you give\n\nsome more such examples? Have you ever\n\nwondered what those hanging structures that\n\nsupport a banyan tree are? These are called\n\nprop roots. Similarly, the stems of maize and\n\nsugarcane have supporting roots coming out\n\nof the lower nodes of the stem. These are called\n\nstilt roots. In some plants such as Rhizophora\n\ngrowing in swampy areas, many roots come out\n\nof the ground and grow vertically upwards.\n\nSuch roots, called pneumatophores, help to\n\nget oxygen for respiration (Figure 5.5b).\n\nFigure 5.3  The regions of the root-tip\n\nFigure 5.4 Modification of root for support:\nBanyan tree\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n68 BIOLOGY\n\n5.2 THE STEM\n\nWhat are the features that distinguish a stem from a root? The stem is the\n\nascending part of the axis bearing branches, leaves, flowers and fruits. It\n\ndevelops from the plumule of the embryo of a germinating seed. The stem\n\nbears nodes and internodes. The region of the stem where leaves are\n\nborn are called nodes while internodes are the portions between two nodes.\n\nThe stem bears buds, which may be terminal or axillary. Stem is generally\n\ngreen when young and later often become woody and dark brown.\n\nThe main function of the stem is spreading out branches bearing\n\nleaves, flowers and fruits. It conducts water, minerals and photosynthates.\n\nSome stems perform the function of storage of food, support, protection\n\nand of vegetative propagation.\n\n5.2.1 Modifications of Stem\n\nThe stem may not always be typically like what they are expected to be.\n\nThey are modified to perform different functions (Figure 5.6). Underground\n\nstems of potato, ginger, turmeric, zaminkand, Colocasia are modified to\n\nstore food in them. They also act as organs of perennation to tide over\n\nconditions unfavourable for growth. Stem tendrils which develop from\n\naxillary buds, are slender and spirally coiled and help plants to climb\n\nsuch as in gourds (cucumber, pumpkins, watermelon) and grapevines.\n\nAxillary buds of stems may also get modified into woody, straight and\n\npointed thorns. Thorns are found in many  plants such as Citrus,\n\nBougainvillea. They protect plants from browsing animals. Some plants\n\nof arid regions modify their stems into flattened (Opuntia), or fleshy\n\ncylindrical (Euphorbia) structures. They contain chlorophyll and carry\n\nFigure 5.5 Modification of root for : (a) storage (b) respiration: pneumatophore in\nRhizophora\n\n(b)( a )\n\nCarrotTurnip Sweet\npotato\n\nAsparagus\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMORPHOLOGY OF FLOWERING PLANTS 69\n\nFigure 5.6 Modifications of stem for :  (a) storage  (b) support  (c) protection\n(d) spread and vegetative propagation\n\nout photosynthesis. Underground stems of some plants such as grass\n\nand strawberry, etc., spread to new niches and when older parts die new\n\nplants are formed. In plants like mint and jasmine a slender lateral branch\n\narises from the base of the main axis and after growing aerially for some\n\ntime arch downwards to touch the ground. A lateral branch with short\n\ninternodes and  each node bearing a rosette of leaves and a tuft of roots is\n\nfound in aquatic plants like Pistia and Eichhornia.  In banana, pineapple\n\nand Chrysanthemum, the lateral branches originate from the basal and\n\nunderground portion of the main stem, grow horizontally beneath the\n\nsoil and then come out obliquely upward giving rise to leafy shoots.\n\n5.3 THE LEAF\n\nThe leaf is a lateral, generally flattened structure borne on the stem. It\n\ndevelops at the node and bears a bud in its axil. The axillary bud later\n\ndevelops into a branch. Leaves originate from shoot apical meristems and\n\nare arranged in an acropetal order. They are the most important vegetative\n\norgans for photosynthesis.\n\nA typical leaf consists of three main parts:  leaf base, petiole and lamina\n\n(Figure 5.7 a). The leaf is attached to the stem by the leaf base and may\n\n(a)\n(b)\n\n(c) (d)\n\nAxillary bud\nmodified\ninto tendril\n\nRoots arising\nfrom nodes\n\nStem modified\ninto spine\n\nGinger\n\nZaminkand\nPotato\n\nBougainvillea sp.\nOxalis sp.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n70 BIOLOGY\n\nbear two lateral small leaf like structures called\n\nstipules. In monocotyledons, the leaf base expands\n\ninto a sheath covering the stem partially or wholly.\n\nIn some leguminous plants the leafbase may\n\nbecome swollen, which is called the pulvinus. The\n\npetiole help hold the blade to light. Long thin flexible\n\npetioles allow leaf blades to flutter in wind, thereby\n\ncooling the leaf and bringing fresh air to leaf surface.\n\nThe lamina or the leaf blade is the green expanded\n\npart of the leaf with veins and veinlets. There is,\n\nusually, a middle prominent vein, which is known\n\nas the midrib. Veins provide rigidity to the leaf blade\n\nand act as channels of transport for water, minerals\n\nand food materials. The shape, margin, apex, surface\n\nand extent of incision of lamina varies in different\n\nleaves.\n\n5.3.1 Venation\n\nThe arrangement of veins and the veinlets in the\n\nlamina of leaf is termed as venation. When the\n\nveinlets form a network, the venation is termed as\n\nreticulate (Figure 5.7 b). When the veins run\n\nparallel to each other within a lamina, the venation\n\nis termed as parallel (Figure 5.7 c). Leaves of\n\ndicotyledonous plants generally possess reticulate\n\nvenation, while parallel venation is the characteristic\n\nof most monocotyledons.\n\n5.3.2 Types of Leaves\n\nA leaf is said to be simple, when its lamina is entire\n\nor when incised, the incisions do not touch the\n\nmidrib. When the incisions of the lamina reach up\n\nto the midrib breaking it into a number of leaflets,\n\nthe leaf is called compound. A bud is present\n\nin the axil of petiole in both simple and compound\n\nleaves, but not in the axil of leaflets of the compound\n\nleaf.\n\nThe compound leaves may be of two types\n\n(Figure 5.8). In a pinnately compound leaf a\n\nnumber of leaflets are present on a common axis,\n\nthe rachis, which represents the midrib of the leaf\n\nas in neem.\n\nFigure 5.7 Structure of a leaf :\n(a) Parts of a leaf\n(b) Reticulate venation\n(c) Parallel venation\n\n(b) (c)\n\n(b) Silk Cotton\n\n(a)\n\nLamina\n\nPetiole\n\nStipule\n\nLeaf\nbase\n\nAxillary\nbud\n\n(a) Neem\n\nFigure 5.8 Compound leaves :\n(a) pinnately compound leaf\n(b) palmately compound leaf\n\nRachis\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMORPHOLOGY OF FLOWERING PLANTS 71\n\nIn palmately compound leaves, the\n\nleaflets are attached at a common point, i.e.,\n\nat the tip of petiole, as in silk cotton.\n\n5.3.3 Phyllotaxy\n\nPhyllotaxy is the pattern of arrangement of\n\nleaves on the stem or branch. This is usually\n\nof three types – alternate, opposite and\n\nwhorled (Figure 5.9). In alternate type of\n\nphyllotaxy,  a single leaf arises at each node\n\nin alternate manner, as in china rose,\n\nmustard and sun flower plants. In opposite\n\ntype, a pair of leaves arise at each node and\n\nlie opposite to each other as in Calotropis\n\nand guava plants. If more than two leaves\n\narise at a node and form a whorl, it is called\n\nwhorled, as in Alstonia.\n\n5.3.4 Modifications of Leaves\n\nLeaves are often modified to perform\n\nfunctions other than photosynthesis. They\n\nare converted into tendrils for climbing as\n\nin peas or into spines for defence as in cacti\n\n(Figure 5.10 a, b). The fleshy leaves of onion\n\nand garlic store food (Figure 5.10c). In some\n\nplants such as Australian acacia, the leaves\n\nare small and short-lived. The petioles in\n\nthese plants expand, become green and\n\nsynthesise food. Leaves of certain\n\ninsectivorous plants such as pitcher plant,\n\nvenus-fly trap are also modified leaves.\n\n5.4 THE INFLORESCENCE\n\nA flower is a modified shoot wherein the shoot\n\napical meristem changes to floral meristem.\n\nInternodes do not elongate and the axis gets\n\ncondensed. The apex produces different\n\nkinds of floral appendages laterally at\n\nsuccessive nodes instead of leaves.  When a\n\nshoot tip transforms into a flower, it is always\n\nsolitary. The arrangement of flowers on the\n\nFigure 5.10 Modifications of leaf for :\n(a) support: tendril  (b) protection:\nspines  (c) storage: fleshy leaves\n\n(c) Onion\n\nFleshy\nleaves\n\nLeaf\ntendril\n\n(a) Pea\n(b) Cactus\n\nLeaves\nmodified\ninto spines\n\nFigure 5.9 Different types of phyllotaxy :\n(a) Alternate (b) Opposite\n(c) Whorled\n\n(c) Alstonia\n\n(a) China rose\n(b) Guava\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n72 BIOLOGY\n\nfloral axis is termed as inflorescence. Depending\n\non whether the apex gets developed into a flower or\n\ncontinues to grow, two major types of inflorescences\n\nare defined – racemose and cymose. In racemose\n\ntype of inflorescences the main axis continues to\n\ngrow, the flowers are borne laterally in an acropetal\n\nsuccession (Figure 5.11).\n\nIn cymose type of  inflorescence the main axis\n\nterminates in a flower, hence is limited in growth.The\n\nflowers are borne in a basipetal order (Figure 5.12).\n\n5.5 THE FLOWER\n\nThe flower is the reproductive unit in the\n\nangiosperms. It is meant for sexual reproduction.\n\nA typical flower has four different kinds of whorls\n\narranged successively on the swollen end of the\n\nstalk or pedicel, called thalamus or receptacle.\n\nThese are calyx, corolla, androecium and\n\ngynoecium. Calyx and corolla are accessory organs,\n\nwhile androecium and gynoecium are reproductive\n\norgans. In some flowers like lily, the calyx and\n\ncorolla are not distinct and are termed as perianth.\n\nWhen a flower has both androecium and\n\ngynoecium, it is bisexual. A flower having either\n\nonly stamens or only carpels is unisexual.\n\nIn symmetry, the flower may be\n\nactinomorphic (radial symmetry) or\n\nzygomorphic (bilateral symmetry). When a flower\n\ncan be divided into two equal radial halves in any\n\nradial plane passing through the centre, it is said\n\nto be actinomorphic, e.g., mustard, datura, chilli.\n\nWhen it can be divided into two similar halves only\n\nin one particular vertical plane, it is zygomorphic,\n\ne.g., pea, gulmohur, bean, Cassia. A flower is\n\nasymmetric (irregular) if it cannot be divided into\n\ntwo similar halves by any vertical plane passing\n\nthrough the centre, as in canna.\n\nA flower may be trimerous, tetramerous or\n\npentamerous when the floral appendages are in\n\nmultiple of 3, 4 or 5, respectively. Flowers\n\nwith bracts-reduced leaf found at the base of the\n\npedicel- are called bracteate and those without\n\nbracts, ebracteate.\n\nFigure 5.12  Cymose inflorescence\n\nFigure 5.11  Racemose inflorescence\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMORPHOLOGY OF FLOWERING PLANTS 73\n\nBased on the position of calyx, corolla and androecium in respect of\n\nthe ovary on thalamus, the flowers are described as hypogynous,\n\nperigynous and epigynous (Figure 5.13). In the hypogynous flower the\n\ngynoecium occupies the highest position while the other parts are situated\n\nbelow it. The ovary in such flowers is said to be superior, e.g., mustard,\n\nchina rose and brinjal. If gynoecium is situated in the centre and other\n\nparts of the flower are located on the rim of the thalamus almost at the\n\nsame level, it is called perigynous. The ovary here is said to be half\n\ninferior, e.g., plum, rose, peach. In epigynous flowers, the margin of\n\nthalamus grows upward enclosing the ovary completely and getting fused\n\nwith it, the other parts of flower arise above the ovary. Hence, the ovary is\n\nsaid to be inferior as in flowers of guava and cucumber, and the ray\n\nflorets of sunflower.\n\n5.5.1 Parts of a Flower\n\nEach flower normally has four floral whorls, viz., calyx, corolla,\n\nandroecium and gynoecium (Figure 5.14).\n\n5.5.1.1 Calyx\n\nThe calyx is the outermost whorl of the flower and the members are called\n\nsepals. Generally, sepals are green, leaf like and protect the flower in the\n\nbud stage. The calyx may be gamosepalous (sepals united) or\n\npolysepalous (sepals free).\n\n5.5.1.2 Corolla\n\nCorolla is composed of petals. Petals are usually brightly coloured to\n\nattract insects for pollination. Like calyx, corolla may also be\n\nFigure 5.13 Position of floral parts on thalamus : (a) Hypogynous (b)  and (c)\nPerigynous  (d) Epigynous\n\n(a) (b) (c) (d)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n74 BIOLOGY\n\ngamopetalous (petals united) or polypetalous (petals free). The shape\n\nand colour of corolla vary greatly in plants. Corolla may be tubular, bell-\n\nshaped, funnel-shaped or wheel-shaped.\n\nAestivation: The mode of arrangement of sepals or petals in floral bud\n\nwith respect to the other members of the same whorl is known as\n\naestivation. The main types of aestivation are valvate, twisted, imbricate\n\nand vexillary (Figure 5.15). When sepals or petals in a whorl just touch\n\none another at the margin, without overlapping, as in Calotropis, it is\n\nsaid to be valvate. If one margin of  the appendage overlaps that of the\n\nnext one and so on as in china rose, lady’s finger and cotton, it is called\n\ntwisted.  If the margins of sepals or petals overlap one another but not in\n\nany particular direction as in Cassia and gulmohur, the aestivation is\n\ncalled imbricate. In pea and bean flowers, there are five petals, the largest\n\n(standard) overlaps the two lateral petals (wings) which in turn overlap\n\nthe two smallest anterior petals (keel);  this type of aestivation is known\n\nas vexillary or papilionaceous.\n\nPedicel\n\nCalyx\n\nCorolla\n\nAndroecium\n\nGynoecium\n\nFigure 5.14  Parts of a flower\n\nFigure 5.15 Types of aestivation in corolla : (a) Valvate (b) Twisted (c) Imbricate (d) Vexillary\n\n(a) (b) (c) (d)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMORPHOLOGY OF FLOWERING PLANTS 75\n\n5.5.1.3 Androecium\n\nAndroecium is composed of stamens. Each stamen which\n\nrepresents the male reproductive organ consists of a stalk or a\n\nfilament and an anther. Each anther is usually bilobed and each\n\nlobe has two chambers, the pollen-sacs. The pollen grains are\n\nproduced in pollen-sacs. A sterile stamen is called staminode.\n\nStamens of flower may be united with other members such as\n\npetals or among themselves. When stamens are attached to the\n\npetals, they are epipetalous as in brinjal, or epiphyllous when\n\nattached to the perianth as in the flowers of lily. The stamens in a\n\nflower may either remain free (polyandrous) or may be united in\n\nvarying degrees. The stamens may be united into one bunch or\n\none bundle (monoadelphous) as in china rose, or two bundles\n\n(diadelphous) as in pea, or into more than two  bundles\n\n(polyadelphous) as in citrus. There may be a variation in the length\n\nof filaments within a flower, as in Salvia and mustard.\n\n5.5.1.4 Gynoecium\n\nGynoecium is the female reproductive part of the flower and is made\n\nup of one or more carpels. A carpel consists of three parts namely\n\nstigma, style and ovary. Ovary is the enlarged basal part, on which\n\nlies the elongated tube, the style. The style connects the ovary to the\n\nstigma. The stigma is usually at the tip of the style and is the\n\nreceptive surface for pollen grains. Each ovary bears one or more\n\novules attached to a flattened, cushion-like placenta. When more\n\nthan one carpel is present, they may be free (as in lotus and rose)\n\nand are called apocarpous. They are termed syncarpous when\n\ncarpels are fused, as in mustard and tomato. After fertilisation, the\n\novules develop into seeds and the ovary matures into a fruit.\n\nPlacentation: The arrangement of ovules within the ovary is known\n\nas placentation. The placentation are of different types namely,\n\nmarginal, axile, parietal, basal, central and free central (Figure 5.16).\n\nIn marginal  placentation the placenta forms a ridge along the\n\nventral suture of the ovary and the ovules are borne on this ridge\n\nforming two rows, as in pea. When the  placenta is axial and the\n\novules are attached to it in a multilocular ovary, the placentaion is\n\nsaid to be axile, as in china rose, tomato and lemon. In parietal\n\nplacentation, the ovules develop on the inner wall of the ovary or\n\non peripheral part. Ovary is one-chambered but it becomes two-\n\nchambered due to the formation of the false septum, e.g., mustard\n\nand Argemone. When the ovules are borne on central axis and\n\nsepta are absent, as in Dianthus and Primrose the placentation is\n\nFigure 5.16 Types of\nplacentation :\n(a) Marginal\n(b) Axile\n(c) Parietal\n(d) Free central\n(e) Basal\n\n(a)\n\n(e)\n\n(b)\n\n(d)\n\n(c)\n\n(a)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n76 BIOLOGY\n\ncalled free central. In basal placentation, the placenta develops at the\n\nbase of ovary and a single ovule is attached to it, as in sunflower, marigold.\n\n5.6 THE FRUIT\n\nThe fruit is a characteristic feature of the flowering plants. It is a mature\n\nor ripened ovary, developed after fertilisation. If a fruit is formed without\n\nfertilisation of the ovary, it is called a parthenocarpic fruit.\n\nGenerally, the fruit consists of a wall or pericarp and seeds. The\n\npericarp may be dry or fleshy. When pericarp is thick and fleshy, it is\n\ndifferentiated into the outer epicarp, the middle mesocarp and the inner\n\nendocarp.\n\nIn mango and coconut, the fruit is known as a drupe (Figure 5.17).\n\nThey develop from monocarpellary superior ovaries and are one seeded.\n\nIn mango the pericarp is well differentiated into an outer thin epicarp, a\n\nmiddle fleshy edible mesocarp and an inner stony hard endocarp. In\n\ncoconut which is also a drupe, the mesocarp is fibrous.\n\n5.7 THE SEED\n\nThe ovules after fertilisation, develop into seeds. A seed is made up of a\n\nseed coat and an embryo. The embryo is made up of a radicle, an embryonal\n\naxis and one (as in wheat, maize) or two cotyledons (as in gram and pea).\n\n5.7.1 Structure of a Dicotyledonous Seed\n\nThe outermost covering of a seed is the seed coat. The seed coat has two\n\nlayers, the outer testa and the inner tegmen. The hilum is a scar on the\n\nseed coat through which the developing seeds were attached to the fruit.\n\nAbove the hilum is a small pore called the micropyle. Within the seed\n\nFigure 5.17  Parts of a fruit : (a) Mango  (b) Coconut\n\n(a) (b)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMORPHOLOGY OF FLOWERING PLANTS 77\n\ncoat is the embryo, consisting of an\n\nembryonal axis and two cotyledons. The\n\ncotyledons are often fleshy and full of reserve\n\nfood materials. At the two ends of the\n\nembryonal axis are present the radicle and\n\nthe plumule (Figure 5.18). In some seeds\n\nsuch as castor the endosperm formed as a\n\nresult of double fertilisation, is a food storing\n\ntissue and called endospermic seeds. In\n\nplants such as bean, gram and pea, the\n\nendosperm is not present in mature seeds\n\nand such seeds are called non-\n\nendospermous.\n\nSeed coat\n\nHilum\n\nMicropyle\n\nCotyledon\nPlumule\n\nRadicle\n\nFigure 5.18 Structure of dicotyledonous seed\n\nFigure 5.19 Structure of a monocotyledonous seed\n\nSeed coat & fruit-wall\n\nAleurone layer\n\nEndosperm\n\nScutellum\n\nColeoptile\n\nPlumule\n\nRadicle\n\nColeorhiza\n\nEndosperm\n\nEmbryo\n\n5.7.2 Structure of Monocotyledonous Seed\n\nGenerally, monocotyledonous seeds are endospermic but some as in\n\norchids are non-endospermic. In the seeds of cereals such as maize the\n\nseed coat is membranous and generally fused with the fruit wall. The\n\nendosperm is bulky and stores food. The outer covering of endosperm\n\nseparates the embryo by a proteinous layer called aleurone layer. The\n\nembryo is   small and situated in a groove at one end of the endosperm. It\n\nconsists of one large and shield shaped cotyledon known as scutellum\n\nand a short axis with a plumule and a radicle. The plumule and radicle\n\nare enclosed in sheaths which are called coleoptile and coleorhiza\n\nrespectively (Figure 5.19).\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n78 BIOLOGY\n\n5.8 SEMI-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION OF A TYPICAL\nFLOWERING PLANT\n\nVarious morphological features are used to describe a\n\nflowering plant. The description has to be brief, in a simple\n\nand scientific language and presented in a proper\n\nsequence. The plant is described beginning with its habit,\n\nvegetative characters – roots, stem and leaves and then\n\nfloral characters inflorescence and flower parts. After\n\ndescribing various parts of plant, a floral diagram and a\n\nfloral formula are presented. The floral formula is\n\nrepresented by some symbols. In the floral formula, Br\n\nstands for bracteate K stands for calyx , C for corolla, P for\n\nperianth, A for androecium and G for Gynoecium, G for\n\nsuperior ovary and G  for inferior ovary,  for male,  for\n\nfemale,  for bisexual plants, ⊕  for actinomorphic and \n\nfor zygomorphic nature of flower. Fusion is indicated by\n\nenclosing the figure within bracket and adhesion by a line\n\ndrawn above the symbols of the floral parts. A floral\n\ndiagram provides information about the number of parts\n\nof a flower, their arrangement and the relation they have\n\nwith one another (Figure 5.20). The position of the mother\n\naxis with respect to the flower is represented by a dot on\n\nthe top of the floral diagram. Calyx, corolla, androecium\n\nand gynoecium are drawn in successive whorls, calyx being\n\nthe outermost and the gynoecium being in the centre.\n\nFloral formula also shows cohesion and adhesion within\n\nparts of whorls and between whorls. The floral diagram\n\nand floral formula in Figure 5.20 represents the mustard\n\nplant (Family: Brassicaceae).\n\n5.9 DESCRIPTION OF SOME IMPORTANT FAMILIES\n\n5.9.1 Fabaceae\n\nThis family was earlier called Papilionoideae, a subfamily\n\nof family Leguminosae.

They have well developed root and shoot\n\nsystems. Root system is either tap root or fibrous. Generally, dicotyledonous plants\n\nhave tap roots while monocotyledonous plants have fibrous roots. The roots in\n\nsome plants get modified for storage of food, mechanical support and respiration.\n\nThe shoot system is differentiated into stem, leaves, flowers and fruits. The\n\nmorphological features of stems like the presence of nodes and internodes,\n\nmulticellular hair and positively phototropic nature help to differentiate the stems\n\nfrom roots. Stems also get modified to perform diverse functions such as storage\n\nof food, vegetative propagation and protection under different conditions. Leaf is a\n\nlateral outgrowth of stem developed exogeneously at the node. These are green in\n\ncolour to perform the function of photosynthesis. Leaves exhibit marked variations\n\nin their shape, size, margin, apex and extent of incisions of leaf blade (lamina).\n\nLike other parts of plants, the leaves also get modified into other structures such\n\nas tendrils, spines for climbing and protection respectively.\n\nThe flower is a modified shoot, meant for sexual reproduction. The flowers are\n\narranged in different types of inflorescences. They exhibit enormous variation in\n\nstructure, symmetry, position of ovary in relation to other parts, arrangement of\n\npetals, sepals, ovules etc. After fertilisation, the ovary is modified into fruits and\n\novules into seeds. Seeds either may be monocotyledonous or dicotyledonous. They\n\nvary in shape, size and period of viability. The floral characteristics form the basis\n\nof classification and identification of flowering plants. This can be illustrated\n\nthrough semi-technical descriptions of families. Hence, a flowering plant is\n\ndescribed in a definite sequence by using scientific terms. The floral features are\n\nrepresented in the summarised form as floral diagrams and floral formula.\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1. What is meant by modification of root?

Similarly, if we were to study the internal structure, one also\n\nfinds several similarities as well as differences. This chapter introduces\n\nyou to the internal structure and functional organisation of higher plants.\n\nStudy of internal structure of plants is called anatomy. Plants have cells\n\nas the basic unit, cells are organised into tissues and in turn the tissues\n\nare organised into organs. Different organs in a plant show differences in\n\ntheir internal structure. Within angiosperms, the monocots and dicots\n\nare also seen to be anatomically different. Internal structures also show\n\nadaptations to diverse environments.\n\n6.1 THE TISSUES\n\nA tissue is a group of cells having a common origin and usually performing\n\na common function. A plant is made up of different kinds of tissues. Tissues\n\nare classified into two main groups, namely, meristematic  and permanent\n\ntissues based on whether the cells being formed are capable of dividing\n\nor not.\n\n6.1.1 Meristematic Tissues\n\nGrowth in plants is largely restricted to specialised regions of active cell division\n\ncalled meristems (Gk. meristos: divided). Plants have different kinds of\n\nmeristems. The meristems which occur at the tips of roots and shoots and\n\nproduce primary tissues are called apical meristems (Figure 6.1).\n\nANATOMY OF FLOWERING PLANTS\n\nCHAPTER  6\n\n6.1 The Tissues\n\n6.2 The Tissue\n\nSystem\n\n6.3 Anatomy of\n\nDicotyledonous\n\nand\n\nMonocotyledonous\n\nPlants\n\n6.4 Secondary\n\nGrowth\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nANATOMY OF FLOWERING PLANTS 85\n\nRoot apical meristem occupies the tip of a root while the shoot apical\n\nmeristem occupies the distant most region of the stem axis. During the\n\nformation of leaves and elongation of stem, some cells ‘left behind’ from\n\nshoot apical meristem, constitute the axillary bud. Such buds are present\n\nin the axils of leaves and are capable of forming a branch or a flower. The\n\nmeristem which occurs between mature tissues is known as intercalary\n\nmeristem. They occur in grasses and regenerate parts removed by the\n\ngrazing herbivores. Both apical meristems and intercalary meristems are\n\nprimary meristems because they appear early in life of a plant and\n\ncontribute to the formation of the primary plant body.\n\nThe meristem that occurs in the mature regions of roots and shoots of\n\nmany plants, particularly those that produce woody axis and appear\n\nlater than primary meristem is called the secondary or lateral meristem.\n\nThey are cylindrical meristems. Fascicular vascular cambium,\n\ninterfascicular cambium and cork-cambium are examples of lateral\n\nmeristems. These are responsible for producing the secondary tissues.\n\nFollowing divisions of cells in both primary and as well as secondary\n\nmeristems, the newly formed cells become structurally and functionally\n\nspecialised and lose the ability to divide. Such cells are termed permanent\n\nor mature cells and constitute the permanent tissues. During the\n\nformation of the primary plant body, specific regions of the apical meristem\n\nproduce dermal tissues, ground tissues and vascular tissues.\n\nCentral cylinder\n\nCortex\n\nProtoderm\n\nInitials of central\ncylinder\n\nand cortex\n\nInitials of\nroot cap\n\nRoot cap\n\nRoot apical\nmeristem\n\nLeaf primordium\n\nShoot apical\nMeristematic zone\n\nAxillary bud\n\nDifferentiating\nvascular tissue\n\nFigure 6.1  Apical meristem: (a) Root  (b) Shoot\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n86 BIOLOGY\n\n6.1.2 Permanent Tissues\n\nThe cells of the permanent tissues do not generally\n\ndivide further. Permanent tissues having all cells\n\nsimilar in structure and function are called simple\n\ntissues. Permanent tissues having many different\n\ntypes of cells are called complex tissues.\n\n6.1.2.1 Simple Tissues\n\nA simple tissue is made of only one type of cells.\n\nThe various simple tissues in plants are\n\nparenchyma, collenchyma and sclerenchyma\n\n(Figure 6.2). Parenchyma forms the  major\n\ncomponent within organs. The cells of the\n\nparenchyma  are generally isodiametric. They\n\nmay be spherical, oval, round, polygonal or\n\nelongated in shape. Their walls are thin and made\n\nup of cellulose. They may either be closely packed\n\nor have small intercellular spaces. The\n\nparenchyma performs  various functions like\n\nphotosynthesis, storage, secretion.\n\nThe collenchyma occurs in layers below the\n\nepidermis in most of the dicotyledonous plants. It is\n\nfound either as a homogeneous layer or in patches.\n\nIt consists of cells which are much thickened at the\n\ncorners due to a deposition of cellulose,\n\nhemicellulose and pectin. Collenchymatous cells\n\nmay be oval, spherical or polygonal and often\n\ncontain chloroplasts. These cells assimilate food\n\nwhen they contain chloroplasts. Intercellular spaces\n\nare absent. They provide mechanical support to the\n\ngrowing parts of the plant such as young stem and\n\npetiole of a leaf.\n\nSclerenchyma consists of long, narrow cells\n\nwith thick and lignified cell walls having a few or\n\nnumerous pits. They are usually dead and without\n\nprotoplasts. On the basis of variation in form,\n\nstructure, origin and development, sclerenchyma\n\nmay be either fibres or sclereids. The fibres are\n\nthick-walled, elongated and pointed cells,\n\ngenerally occuring in groups, in various parts of\n\nthe plant. The sclereids are spherical, oval or\n\ncylindrical, highly thickened dead cells with very\n\nIntercelluar space\n\nFigure 6.2 Simple tissues :\n(a) Parenchyma\n(b) Collenchyma\n(c) Sclerenchyma\n\nA fibre\n\nA sclereid\n\n(c)\n\nLumen\n\nThick\ncell wall\n\nLumen\n\nPits\n\nThick\ncell wall\n\n(b)\n\nThickened corners\n\nProtoplasm\n\nVacuole\n\nCell wall\n\n(a)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nANATOMY OF FLOWERING PLANTS 87\n\nnarrow cavities (lumen). These are commonly found in the fruit\n\nwalls of nuts; pulp of fruits like guava, pear and sapota; seed\n\ncoats of legumes and leaves of tea. Sclerenchyma provides\n\nmechanical support to organs.\n\n6.1.2.2 Complex Tissues\n\nThe complex tissues are made of more than one type of cells\n\nand these work together as a unit. Xylem and phloem constitute\n\nthe complex tissues in plants (Figure 6.3).\n\nXylem functions as a conducting tissue for water and\n\nminerals from roots to the stem and leaves. It also provides\n\nmechanical strength to the plant parts. It is composed of four\n\ndifferent kinds of elements, namely, tracheids, vessels, xylem\n\nfibres and xylem parenchyma. Gymnosperms lack vessels in\n\ntheir xylem. Tracheids are elongated or tube like cells with\n\nthick and lignified walls and tapering ends. These are dead and\n\nare without protoplasm. The inner layers of the cell walls have\n\nthickenings which vary in form.  In flowering plants, tracheids\n\nand vessels are the main water transporting elements. Vessel is\n\na long cylindrical tube-like structure made up of many cells\n\ncalled vessel members, each with lignified walls and a large\n\ncentral cavity. The vessel cells are also devoid of protoplasm.\n\nVessel members are interconnected through perforations in their\n\ncommon walls. The presence of vessels is a characteristic feature\n\nof angiosperms. Xylem fibres have highly thickened walls and\n\nobliterated central lumens. These may either be septate or\n\naseptate. Xylem parenchyma cells are living and thin-walled,\n\nand their cell walls are made up of cellulose. They store food\n\nmaterials in the form of starch or fat, and other substances like\n\ntannins. The radial conduction of water takes place by the ray\n\nparenchymatous cells.\n\nPrimary xylem is of two types – protoxylem and metaxylem.\n\nThe first formed primary xylem elements are called protoxylem\n\nand the later formed primary xylem is called metaxylem. In\n\nstems, the protoxylem lies towards the centre (pith) and the\n\nmetaxylem lies towards the periphery of the organ. This type\n\nof primary xylem is called endarch. In roots, the protoxylem\n\nlies towards periphery and metaxylem lies towards the centre.\n\nSuch arrangement of primary xylem is called exarch.\n\nPhloem transports food materials, usually from leaves to\n\nother parts of the plant. Phloem in angiosperms is composed\n\nof sieve tube elements, companion cells, phloem parenchyma\n\nPhloem\nparenchyma\n\nCompanion\ncell\n\n(b)\n\nSieve pore\n\nSieve tube\nelement\n\nFigure 6.3 (a) Xylem\n      (b) Phloem\n\n(a)\n\nTracheid\n\nVessels\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n88 BIOLOGY\n\nand phloem fibres. Gymnosperms have albuminous cells and sieve cells.\n\nThey lack sieve tubes and companion cells. Sieve tube elements are\n\nalso long, tube-like structures, arranged  longitudinally and are\n\nassociated with the companion cells. Their end walls are perforated in a\n\nsieve-like manner to form the sieve plates. A mature sieve element\n\npossesses a peripheral cytoplasm and a large vacuole but lacks a nucleus.\n\nThe functions of sieve tubes are controlled by the nucleus of companion\n\ncells. The companion cells are specialised parenchymatous cells, which\n\nare closely associated with sieve tube elements. The sieve tube elements\n\nand companion cells are connected by pit fields present between their\n\ncommon longitudinal walls. The companion cells help in maintaining the\n\npressure gradient in the sieve tubes. Phloem parenchyma is made up\n\nof elongated, tapering cylindrical cells which have dense cytoplasm and\n\nnucleus. The cell wall is composed of cellulose and has pits through which\n\nplasmodesmatal connections exist between the cells. The phloem\n\nparenchyma stores food material and other substances like resins, latex\n\nand mucilage. Phloem parenchyma is absent in most of the\n\nmonocotyledons. Phloem fibres (bast fibres) are made up of\n\nsclerenchymatous cells. These are generally absent in the primary phloem\n\nbut are found in the secondary phloem. These are much elongated,\n\nunbranched and have pointed, needle like apices. The cell wall of phloem\n\nfibres is quite thick. At maturity, these fibres lose their protoplasm and\n\nbecome dead. Phloem fibres of jute, flax and hemp are used commercially.\n\nThe first formed primary phloem consists of narrow sieve tubes and is\n\nreferred to as protophloem and the later formed phloem has bigger sieve\n\ntubes and is referred to as metaphloem.\n\n6.2 THE TISSUE SYSTEM\n\nWe were discussing types of tissues based on the types of cells present.\n\nLet us now consider how tissues vary depending on their location in the\n\nplant body. Their structure and function would also be dependent on\n\nlocation. On the basis of their structure and location, there are three types\n\nof tissue systems. These are the epidermal tissue system, the ground or\n\nfundamental tissue system and the vascular or conducting tissue system.\n\n6.2.1 Epidermal Tissue System\n\nThe epidermal tissue system forms the outer-most covering of the whole\n\nplant body and comprises epidermal cells, stomata and the epidermal\n\nappendages – the trichomes and hairs. The epidermis is the outermost\n\nlayer of the primary plant body. It is made up of elongated, compactly\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nANATOMY OF FLOWERING PLANTS 89\n\nThe cells of epidermis bear a number of hairs. The root hairs are\n\nunicellular elongations of the epidermal cells and help absorb water and\n\nminerals from the soil. On the stem the epidermal hairs are called\n\ntrichomes. The trichomes in the shoot system are usually multicellular.\n\nThey may be branched  or unbranched and soft or stiff. They may even\n\nbe secretory. The trichomes help in preventing water loss due to\n\ntranspiration.\n\n6.2.2 The Ground Tissue System\n\nAll tissues except epidermis and vascular bundles constitute the ground\n\ntissue. It consists of simple tissues such as parenchyma, collenchyma\n\nand sclerenchyma. Parenchymatous cells are usually present in cortex,\n\npericycle, pith and medullary rays, in the primary stems and roots. In\n\nleaves, the ground tissue consists of thin-walled chloroplast containing\n\ncells and is called mesophyll.\n\narranged cells, which form a continuous layer. Epidermis is usually single-\n\nlayered. Epidermal cells are parenchymatous with a small amount of\n\ncytoplasm lining the cell wall and a large vacuole. The outside of the\n\nepidermis is often covered with a waxy thick layer called the cuticle which\n\nprevents the loss of water. Cuticle is absent in roots. Stomata are structures\n\npresent in the epidermis of leaves. Stomata regulate the process of\n\ntranspiration and gaseous exchange. Each stoma is composed of two bean-\n\nshaped cells known as guard cells which enclose stomatal pore. In grasses,\n\nthe guard cells are dumb-bell shaped. The outer walls of guard cells (away\n\nfrom the stomatal pore) are thin and the inner walls (towards the stomatal\n\npore) are highly thickened. The guard cells possess chloroplasts and\n\nregulate the opening and closing of stomata. Sometimes, a few epidermal\n\ncells, in the vicinity of the guard cells become specialised in their shape and\n\nsize and are known as subsidiary cells. The stomatal aperture, guard\n\ncells and the surrounding subsidiary cells are together called stomatal\n\napparatus (Figure 6.4).\n\nFigure 6.4 Diagrammatic representation: (a) stomata with bean-shaped guard cells\n(b) stomata with dumb-bell shaped guard cell\n\nEpidermal cells\n\nSubsidiary cells\n\nGuard cells\n\nStomatal\npore\n\nChloroplast\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n90 BIOLOGY\n\n6.2.3 The Vascular Tissue System\n\nThe vascular system consists of complex tissues,\n\nthe phloem and the xylem.The xylem and\n\nphloem together constitute vascular bundles\n\n(Figure 6.5). In dicotyledonous stems, cambium\n\nis present between phloem and xylem. Such\n\nvascular bundles because of the presence of\n\ncambium possess the ability to form secondary\n\nxylem and phloem tissues, and hence are called\n\nopen vascular bundles. In the monocotyledons,\n\nthe vascular bundles have no cambium present\n\nin them. Hence, since they do not form secondary\n\ntissues they are referred to as closed. When\n\nxylem and phloem within a vascular bundle are\n\narranged in an alternate manner along the\n\ndifferent radii, the arrangement is called radial\n\nsuch as in roots. In conjoint type of vascular\n\nbundles, the xylem and phloem are jointly\n\nsituated  along the same radius of vascular\n\nbundles. Such vascular bundles are common\n\nin stems and leaves. The conjoint vascular\n\nbundles usually have the phloem located only\n\non the outer side of xylem.\n\n6.3 ANATOMY OF DICOTYLEDONOUS AND\nMONOCOTYLEDONOUS PLANTS\n\nFor a better understanding of tissue\n\norganisation of roots, stems and leaves, it is\n\nconvenient to study the transverse sections of\n\nthe mature zones of these organs.\n\n6.3.1 Dicotyledonous Root\n\nLook at Figure 6.6 (a), it shows the transverse\n\nsection of the sunflower root. The internal tissue\n\norganisation is as follows:\n\nThe outermost layer is epiblema. Many of\n\nthe cells of epiblema protrude in the form of\n\nunicellular root hairs. The cortex consists of\n\nseveral layers of thin-walled parenchyma cells\n\nFigure 6.5 Various types of vascular bundles :\n(a) radial  (b) conjoint closed\n(c) conjoint open\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nANATOMY OF FLOWERING PLANTS 91\n\nwith intercellular spaces. The innermost\n\nlayer of the cortex is called endodermis.\n\nIt comprises a single layer of barrel-shaped\n\ncells without any intercellular spaces. The\n\ntangential as well as radial walls of the\n\nendodermal cells have a deposition of\n\nwater-impermeable, waxy material suberin\n\nin the form of casparian strips. Next to\n\nendodermis lies a few layers of thick-walled\n\nparenchyomatous cells referred to as\n\npericycle.  Initiation of lateral roots and\n\nvascular cambium during the secondary\n\ngrowth takes place in these cells. The pith\n\nis small or inconspicuous. The\n\nparenchymatous cells which lie between\n\nthe xylem and the phloem are called\n\nconjuctive tissue. There are usually two\n\nto four xylem and phloem patches. Later,\n\na cambium ring develops between the\n\nxylem and phloem. All tissues on the\n\ninnerside of the endodermis such as\n\npericycle, vascular bundles and pith\n\nconstitute the stele.\n\n6.3.2 Monocotyledonous Root\n\nThe anatomy of the monocot root is similar\n\nto the dicot root in many respects (Figure\n\n6.6 b). It has epidermis, cortex, endodermis,\n\npericycle, vascular bundles and pith. As\n\ncompared to the dicot root which have fewer\n\nxylem bundles, there are usually more than\n\nsix (polyarch) xylem bundles in the monocot\n\nroot. Pith is large and well developed.\n\nMonocotyledonous roots do not undergo\n\nany secondary growth.\n\n6.3.3 Dicotyledonous Stem\n\nThe transverse section of a typical young\n\ndicotyledonous stem shows that the epidermis\n\nis the outermost protective layer of the stem\n\nRoot hair\n\nEpidermis\n\nCortex\n\nEndodermis\n\nProtoxylem\n\nMetaxylem\n\nPith\n\nPhloem\n\n(a)\n\nPericycle\n\nRoot hair\n\nCortex\n\nEndodermis\n\nPhloem\n\nProtoxylem\n\nPith\n\nMetaxylem\n\n(b)\n\nEpidermis\n\nPericycle\n\nFigure 6.6 T.S. : (a) Dicot root (Primary)\n(b) Monocot root\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n92 BIOLOGY\n\n(Figure 6.7 a). Covered with a thin layer of cuticle, it may bear trichomes and\n\na few stomata. The cells arranged in multiple layers between epidermis and\n\npericycle constitute the cortex. It consists of three sub-zones. The outer\n\nhypodermis, consists of a few layers of collenchymatous cells just below the\n\nepidermis, which provide mechanical strength to the young stem. Cortical\n\nlayers below hypodermis consist of rounded thin walled parenchymatous\n\ncells with conspicuous intercellular spaces. The innermost layer of the cortex\n\nis called the endodermis. The cells of the endodermis are rich in starch\n\ngrains and the layer is also referred to as the starch sheath. Pericycle is\n\nFigure 6.7  T.S. of stem :  (a) Dicot  (b) Monocot\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nANATOMY OF FLOWERING PLANTS 93\n\npresent on the inner side of the endodermis and above the phloem in the\n\nform of semi-lunar patches of sclerenchyma. In between the vascular bundles\n\nthere are a few layers of radially placed parenchymatous cells, which constitute\n\nmedullary rays. A large number of vascular bundles are arranged in a ring ;\n\nthe ‘ring’ arrangement of vascular bundles is a characteristic of dicot stem.\n\nEach vascular bundle is conjoint, open, and with endarch protoxylem. A\n\nlarge number of rounded, parenchymatous cells with large intercellular\n\nspaces which occupy the central portion of the stem constitute the pith.\n\n6.3.4 Monocotyledonous Stem\n\nThe monocot stem has a sclerenchymatous hypodermis, a large number\n\nof scattered vascular bundles, each surrounded by a sclerenchymatous\n\nbundle sheath, and a large, conspicuous parenchymatous ground tissue\n\n(Figure 6.7b). Vascular bundles are conjoint  and closed. Peripheral\n\nvascular bundles are generally smaller than the centrally located ones.\n\nThe phloem parenchyma is absent, and water-containing cavities are\n\npresent within the vascular bundles.\n\n6.3.5 Dorsiventral (Dicotyledonous) Leaf\n\nThe vertical section of a dorsiventral leaf through the lamina shows three\n\nmain parts, namely, epidermis, mesophyll and vascular system. The\n\nepidermis which covers both the upper surface (adaxial epidermis) and\n\nlower  surface (abaxial epidermis) of the leaf has a conspicuous cuticle.\n\nThe abaxial epidermis generally bears more stomata than the adaxial\n\nepidermis. The latter may even lack stomata. The tissue between the upper\n\nand the lower epidermis is called the mesophyll. Mesophyll, which\n\npossesses chloroplasts and carry out photosynthesis, is made up of\n\nparenchyma. It has two types of cells – the palisade parenchyma and\n\nthe spongy parenchyma. The adaxially placed palisade parenchyma is\n\nmade up of elongated cells, which are arranged vertically and parallel to\n\neach other. The oval or round and loosely arranged spongy parenchyma\n\nis situated below the palisade cells and extends to the lower epidermis.\n\nThere are numerous large spaces and air cavities between these cells.\n\nVascular system includes vascular bundles, which can be seen in the\n\nveins and the midrib. The size of the vascular bundles are dependent on\n\nthe size of the veins. The veins vary in thickness in the reticulate venation\n\nof the dicot leaves. The vascular bundles are surrounded by a layer of\n\nthick walled bundle sheath cells. Look at Figure 6.8 (a) and find the\n\nposition of xylem in the vascular bundle.\n\n6.3.6 Isobilateral (Monocotyledonous) Leaf\n\nThe anatomy of isobilateral leaf is similar to that of the dorsiventral leaf in\n\nmany ways. It shows the following characteristic differences. In an\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n94 BIOLOGY\n\nisobilateral leaf, the stomata are present\n\non both the surfaces of the epidermis; and\n\nthe mesophyll is not differentiated into\n\npalisade and spongy parenchyma (Figure\n\n6.8 b).\n\nIn grasses, certain adaxial epidermal\n\ncells along the veins modify themselves\n\ninto large, empty, colourless cells. These\n\nare called bulliform cells. When the\n\nbulliform cells in the leaves have absorbed\n\nwater and are turgid, the leaf surface is\n\nexposed. When they are flaccid due to\n\nwater stress, they make the leaves curl\n\ninwards to minimise water loss.\n\nThe parallel venation in monocot\n\nleaves is reflected in the near similar sizes\n\nof vascular bundles (except in main veins)\n\nas seen in vertical sections of the leaves.\n\n6.4 SECONDARY GROWTH\n\nThe growth of the roots and stems in\n\nlength with the help of apical meristem is\n\ncalled the primary growth. Apart from\n\nprimary growth most dicotyledonous\n\nplants exhibit an increase in girth. This\n\nincrease is called the secondary growth.\n\nThe tissues involved in secondary growth\n\nare the two lateral meristems: vascular\n\ncambium and cork cambium.\n\n6.4.1 Vascular Cambium\n\nThe meristematic layer that is responsible\n\nfor cutting off vascular tissues – xylem and\n\npholem – is called vascular cambium. In\n\nthe young stem it is present in patches as\n\na single layer between the xylem and\n\nphloem. Later it forms a complete ring.\n\n6.4.1.1 Formation of cambial ring\n\nIn dicot stems, the cells of cambium present\n\nbetween primary xylem and primary\n\nphloem is the intrafascicular cambium.\n\nFigure 6.8  T.S. of leaf : (a) Dicot  (b) Monocot\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nANATOMY OF FLOWERING PLANTS 95\n\nThe cells of medullary rays, adjoining these intrafascicular cambium become\n\nmeristematic and form the interfascicular cambium. Thus, a continuous\n\nring of cambium is formed.\n\n6.4.1.2 Activity of the cambial ring\n\nThe cambial ring becomes active and begins to cut off new cells, both\n\ntowards the inner and the outer sides. The cells cut off towards pith,\n\nmature into secondary xylem and the cells cut off towards periphery\n\nmature into secondary phloem. The cambium is generally more active\n\non the inner side than on the outer. As a result, the amount of secondary\n\nxylem produced is more than secondary phloem and soon forms a\n\ncompact mass. The primary and secondary phloems get gradually\n\ncrushed due to the continued formation and accumulation of secondary\n\nxylem. The primary xylem however remains more or less intact, in or\n\naround the centre. At some places, the cambium forms a narrow band of\n\nparenchyma, which passes through the secondary xylem and the\n\nsecondary phloem in the radial directions. These are the secondary\n\nmedullary rays (Figure 6.9).\n\nFigure 6.9  Secondary growth in a dicot stem (diagrammatic) – stages in transverse views\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n96 BIOLOGY\n\n6.4.1.3 Spring wood and autumn wood\n\nThe activity of cambium is under the control of many physiological and\n\nenvironmental factors. In temperate regions, the climatic conditions are\n\nnot uniform through the year. In the spring season, cambium is very\n\nactive and produces a large number of xylary elements having vessels\n\nwith wider cavities. The wood formed during this season is called spring\n\nwood or early wood. In winter, the cambium is less active and forms\n\nfewer xylary elements that have narrow vessels, and this wood is called\n\nautumn wood or late wood.\n\nThe spring wood is lighter in colour and has a lower density whereas\n\nthe autumn wood is darker and has a higher density. The two kinds of\n\nwoods that appear as alternate concentric rings, constitute an annual ring.\n\nAnnual rings seen in a cut stem give an estimate of the age of the tree.\n\n6.4.1.4 Heartwood and sapwood\n\nIn old trees, the greater part of secondary xylem is dark brown due to\n\ndeposition of organic compounds like tannins, resins, oils, gums, aromatic\n\nsubstances and essential oils in the central or innermost layers of the stem.\n\nThese substances make it hard, durable and resistant to the attacks of micro-\n\norganisms and insects. This region comprises dead elements with highly\n\nlignified walls and is called heartwood. The heartwood does not conduct\n\nwater but it gives mechanical support to the stem. The peripheral region of\n\nthe secondary xylem, is lighter in colour and is known as the sapwood. It is\n\ninvolved in the conduction of water and minerals from root to leaf.\n\n6.4.2 Cork Cambium\n\nAs the stem continues to increase in girth due to the activity of vascular\n\ncambium, the outer cortical and epidermis layers get broken and need to\n\nbe replaced to provide new protective cell layers. Hence, sooner or later,\n\nanother meristematic tissue called cork cambium or phellogen develops,\n\nusually in the cortex region. Phellogen is a couple of layers thick. It is\n\nmade of narrow, thin-walled and nearly rectangular cells. Phellogen cuts\n\noff cells on both sides. The outer cells differentiate into cork or phellem\n\nwhile the inner cells differentiate into secondary cortex or phelloderm.\n\nThe cork is impervious to water due to suberin deposition in the cell wall.\n\nThe cells of secondary cortex are parenchymatous. Phellogen, phellem,\n\nand phelloderm are collectively known as periderm. Due to activity of\n\nthe cork cambium, pressure builds up on the remaining layers peripheral\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nANATOMY OF FLOWERING PLANTS 97\n\nFigure 6.10  (a) Lenticel and (b) Bark\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\nEpidermis\n\nComplimentary\ncells\n\nCork cambium\n\nSecondary\ncortex\n\n(a)\n\nto phellogen and ultimately these\n\nlayers die and slough off.  Bark is a\n\nnon-technical term that refers to all\n\ntissues exterior to the vascular\n\ncambium, therefore including\n\nsecondary phloem. Bark refers to a\n\nnumber of tissue types, viz.,\n\nperiderm and secondary phloem.\n\nBark that is formed early in the\n\nseason is called early or soft bark.\n\nTowards the end of the season, late\n\nor hard bark is formed. Name the\n\nvarious kinds of cell layers which\n\nconstitute the bark.\n\nAt certain regions, the phellogen\n\ncuts off closely arranged\n\nparenchymatous cells on the outer\n\nside instead of cork cells. These\n\nparenchymatous cells soon rupture\n\nthe epidermis, forming a lens-\n\nshaped openings called lenticels.\n\nLenticels permit the exchange of\n\ngases between the outer atmosphere\n\nand the internal tissue of the stem.\n\nThese occur in most woody trees\n\n(Figure 6.10).\n\n6.4.3 Secondary Growth in\n\nRoots\n\nIn the dicot root, the vascular\n\ncambium is completely secondary in\n\norigin. It originates from the tissue\n\nlocated just below the phloem\n\nbundles, a portion of pericycle tissue,\n\nabove the protoxylem forming a\n\ncomplete and continuous wavy ring,\n\nwhich later becomes circular (Figure\n\n6.11).

The plant tissues are\n\nbroadly classified into meristematic (apical, lateral and intercalary) and permanent\n\n(simple and complex). Assimilation of food and its storage, transportation of water,\n\nminerals and photosynthates, and mechanical support are the main functions of\n\ntissues. There are three types of tissue  systems – epidermal, ground and vascular.\n\nThe epidermal tissue systems are made of epidermal cells, stomata and the\n\nepidermal appendages. The ground tissue system forms the main bulk of the\n\nplant. It is divided into three zones – cortex, pericycle and pith. The vascular\n\ntissue system is formed by the xylem and phloem. On the basis of presence of\n\ncambium, location of xylem and phloem, the vascular bundles are of different\n\ntypes.

In unicellular\n\norganisms, all functions like digestion, respiration and reproduction\n\nare performed by a single cell. In the complex body of multicellular\n\nanimals the same basic functions are carried out by different groups of\n\ncells in a well organised manner. The body of a simple organism like\n\nHydra is made of different types of cells and the number of cells in each\n\ntype can be in thousands. The human body is composed of billions of\n\ncells to perform various functions. How do these cells in the body work\n\ntogether? In multicellular animals, a group of similar cells alongwith\n\nintercellular substances perform a specific function. Such an organisation\n\nis called tissue.\n\nYou may be surprised to know that all complex animals consist of\n\nonly four basic types of tissues. These tissues are organised in specific\n\nproportion and pattern to form an organ like stomach, lung, heart and\n\nkidney. When two or more organs perform a common function by their\n\nphysical and/or chemical interaction, they together form organ system,\n\ne.g., digestive system, respiratory system, etc. Cells, tissues, organs and\n\norgan systems split up the work in a way that exhibits division of labour\n\nand contribute to the survival of the body as a whole.\n\n7.1 ANIMAL TISSUES\n\nThe structure of the cells vary according to their function. Therefore, the\n\ntissues are different and are broadly classified into four types : (i) Epithelial,\n\n(ii) Connective, (iii) Muscular and (iv) Neural.\n\nSTRUCTURAL ORGANISATION IN\nANIMALS\n\nCHAPTER  7\n\n7.1 Animal Tissues\n\n7.2 Organ and Organ\n\nSystem\n\n7.3 Earthworm\n\n7.4 Cockroach\n\n7.5 Frogs\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSTRUCTURAL ORGANISATION IN ANIMALS 101\n\n7.1.1 Epithelial Tissue\n\nWe commonly refer to an epithelial tissue as epithelium (pl.: epithelia).\n\nThis tissue has a free surface, which faces either a body fluid or the outside\n\nenvironment and thus provides a covering or a lining for some part of the\n\nbody. The cells are compactly packed with little intercellular matrix. There\n\nare two types of epithelial tissues namely simple epithelium and\n\ncompound epithelium.  Simple epithelium is composed of a single layer\n\nof cells and functions as a lining for body cavities, ducts, and tubes. The\n\ncompound epithelium consists of two or more cell layers and has protective\n\nfunction as it does in our skin.\n\nOn the basis of structural modification of the cells, simple epithelium\n\nis further divided into three types. These are (i) Squamous, (ii) Cuboidal,\n\n(iii) Columnar (Figure 7.1).\n\nThe squamous epithelium is made of a single thin layer of flattened\n\ncells with irregular boundaries. They are found in the walls of blood vessels\n\nand air sacs of lungs and are involved in functions like forming a diffusion\n\nboundary. The cuboidal epithelium is composed of a single layer of\n\ncube-like cells. This is commonly found in ducts of glands and tubular\n\nparts of nephrons in kidneys and its main functions are secretion and\n\nabsorption. The epithelium of proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) of\n\nnephron in the kidney has microvilli. The columnar epithelium is\n\ncomposed of a single layer of tall and slender cells. Their nuclei are located\n\nat the base. Free surface may have microvilli. They are found in the lining\n\nof stomach and intestine and help in secretion and absorption. If the\n\ncolumnar or cuboidal cells bear cilia on their free surface they are called\n\nciliated epithelium (Figure 7.1d). Their function is to move particles or\n\nmucus in a specific direction over the epithelium. They are mainly present\n\nin the inner surface of hollow organs like bronchioles and fallopian tubes.\n\nFigure 7.1 Simple epithelium: (a) Squamous (b) Cuboidal (c) Columnar\n(d) Columnar cells bearing cilia\n\n(a)\nFlattened cell\n\nCube-like cell\n\nTall cell\n\n(b)\n\n(d)\n(c)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n102 BIOLOGY\n\nSome of the columnar or cuboidal cells\n\nget specialised for secretion and are called\n\nglandular epithelium (Figure 7.2). They\n\nare mainly of two types: unicellular,\n\nconsisting of isolated glandular cells (goblet\n\ncells of the alimentary canal), and\n\nmulticellular, consisting of cluster of cells\n\n(salivary gland). On the basis of the mode of\n\npouring of their secretions, glands are\n\ndivided into two categories namely\n\nexocrine and endocrine glands. Exocrine\n\nglands secrete mucus, saliva, earwax, oil,\n\nmilk, digestive enzymes and other cell\n\nproducts. These products are released\n\nthrough ducts or tubes. In contrast,\n\nendocrine glands do not have ducts. Their\n\nproducts called hormones are secreted\n\ndirectly into the fluid bathing the gland.\n\nCompound epithelium is made of more\n\nthan one layer (multi-layered) of cells and thus\n\nhas a limited role in secretion and absorption\n\n(Figure 7.3). Their main function is to provide\n\nprotection against chemical and mechanical\n\nstresses. They cover the dry surface of the skin,\n\nthe moist surface of buccal cavity, pharynx,\n\ninner lining of ducts of salivary glands and of\n\npancreatic ducts.\n\nAll cells in epithelium are held together with little intercellular material.\n\nIn nearly all animal tissues, specialised junctions provide both structural\n\nand functional links between its individual cells. Three types of cell junctions\n\nare found in the epithelium and other tissues. These are called as tight,\n\nadhering and gap junctions. Tight junctions help to stop substances\n\nfrom leaking across a tissue. Adhering junctions perform cementing to\n\nkeep neighbouring cells together. Gap junctions facilitate the cells to\n\ncommunicate with each other by connecting the cytoplasm of adjoining\n\ncells, for rapid transfer of ions, small molecules and sometimes big molecules.\n\n7.1.2 Connective Tissue\n\nConnective tissues are most abundant and widely distributed in the body\n\nof complex animals. They are named connective tissues because of their\n\nspecial function of linking and supporting other tissues/organs of the\n\nbody. They range from soft connective tissues to specialised types, which\n\nFigure 7.2 Glandular epithelium : (a) Unicellular\n(b) Multicellular\n\nunicellular\ngland\n\nMulticelluar\ngland\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 7.3 Compound epithelium\n\nMulti-\nlayered\ncells\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSTRUCTURAL ORGANISATION IN ANIMALS 103\n\nFat storage\narea\n\nNucleus\n\nMacro-\nphage\n\nMast\ncell\n\nFibroblast\n\nCollagen\nfibers\n\nPlasma\nMembrane\n\ninclude cartilage, bone, adipose, and blood. In all\n\nconnective tissues except blood, the cells secrete fibres of\n\nstructural proteins called collagen or elastin. The fibres\n\nprovide strength, elasticity and flexibility to the tissue.\n\nThese cells also secrete modified polysaccharides, which\n\naccumulate between cells and fibres and act as\n\nmatrix (ground substance). Connective tissues are\n\nclassified into three types: (i) Loose connective tissue,\n\n(ii) Dense connective tissue and (iii) Specialised\n\nconnective tissue.\n\nLoose connective tissue has cells and fibres loosely\n\narranged in a semi-fluid ground substance, for example,\n\nareolar tissue present beneath the skin (Figure 7.4). Often\n\nit serves as a support framework for epithelium. It\n\ncontains fibroblasts (cells that produce and secrete fibres),\n\nmacrophages and mast cells. Adipose tissue is another\n\ntype of loose connective tissue located mainly beneath the\n\nskin. The cells of this tissue are specialised to store fats.\n\nThe excess of nutrients which are not used immediately\n\nare converted into fats and are stored in this tissue.\n\nFibres and fibroblasts are compactly packed in the\n\ndense connective tissues. Orientation of fibres show a\n\nregular or irregular pattern and are called dense regular\n\nand dense irregular tissues. In the dense regular\n\nconnective tissues, the collagen fibres are present in rows\n\nbetween many parallel bundles of fibres. Tendons, which\n\nattach skeletal muscles to bones and ligaments which\n\nattach one bone to another are examples of this tissue.\n\nDense irregular connective tissue has fibroblasts and\n\nmany fibres (mostly collagen) that are oriented differently\n\n(Figure 7.5). This tissue is present in the skin. Cartilage,\n\nFigure 7.4 Loose connective tissue : (a) Areolar tissue  (b) Adipose tissue\n\n(a)\n(b)\n\nfibres\n\nCollagen fibre\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 7.5 Dense connective tissue:\n(a) Dense regular\n(b) Dense irregular\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n104 BIOLOGY\n\nbones and blood are various types of specialised\n\nconnective tissues.\n\nThe intercellular material of cartilage is solid and pliable\n\nand resists compression. Cells of this tissue (chondrocytes)\n\nare enclosed in small cavities within the matrix secreted by\n\nthem (Figure 7.6a). Most of the cartilages in vertebrate\n\nembryos are replaced by bones in adults. Cartilage is\n\npresent in the tip of nose, outer ear joints, between adjacent\n\nbones of the vertebral column, limbs and hands in adults.\n\nBones have a hard and non-pliable ground substance\n\nrich in calcium salts and collagen fibres which give bone\n\nits strength (Figure 7.6b). It is the main tissue that provides\n\nstructural frame to the body. Bones support and protect\n\nsofter tissues and organs. The bone cells (osteocytes) are\n\npresent in the  spaces called lacunae. Limb bones, such as\n\nthe long bones of the legs, serve weight-bearing functions.\n\nThey also interact with skeletal muscles attached to them\n\nto bring about movements. The bone marrow in some bones\n\nis the site of production of blood cells.\n\nBlood is a fluid connective tissue containing plasma,\n\nred blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC) and platelets\n\n(Figure 7.6c). It is the main circulating fluid that helps in\n\nthe transport of various substances. You will learn more\n\nabout blood in Chapters 17 and 18.\n\n7.1.3 Muscle Tissue\n\nEach muscle is made of many long, cylindrical fibres\n\narranged in parallel arrays. These fibres are composed of\n\nnumerous fine fibrils, called myofibrils. Muscle fibres\n\ncontract (shorten) in response to stimulation, then relax\n\n(lengthen) and return to their uncontracted state in a\n\ncoordinated fashion. Their action moves the body to adjust\n\nto the changes in the environment and to maintain the\n\npositions of the various parts of the body. In general,\n\nmuscles play an active role in all the movements of the body.\n\nMuscles are of three types, skeletal, smooth, and cardiac.\n\nSkeletal muscle tissue is closely attached to skeletal\n\nbones. In a typical muscle such as the biceps, striated\n\n(striped) skeletal muscle fibres are bundled together in a\n\nparallel fashion (Figure 7.7a). A sheath of tough connective\n\ntissue encloses several bundles of muscle fibres (You will\n\nlearn more about this in Chapter 20).\n\nPlatelets\n\nWBC\n\nRBC\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 7.6 Specialised connective\ntissues : (a) Cartilage\n(b) Bone  (c) Blood\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSTRUCTURAL ORGANISATION IN ANIMALS 105\n\nThe smooth muscle fibres taper at both ends (fusiform) and do not\n\nshow striations (Figure 7.7b). Cell junctions hold them together and they\n\nare bundled together in a connective tissue sheath. The wall of internal\n\norgans such as the blood vessels, stomach and intestine contains this type\n\nof muscle tissue. Smooth muscles are ‘involuntary’ as their functioning\n\ncannot be directly controlled. We usually are not able to make it contract\n\nmerely by thinking about it as we can do with skeletal muscles.\n\nCardiac muscle tissue is a contractile tissue present only in the heart.\n\nCell junctions fuse the plasma membranes of cardiac muscle cells and\n\nmake them stick together (Figure 7.7c). Communication junctions\n\n(intercalated discs) at some fusion points allow the cells to contract as a\n\nunit, i.e., when one cell receives a signal to contract, its neighbours are\n\nalso stimulated to contract.\n\n7.1.4 Neural Tissue\n\nNeural tissue exerts the greatest control over\n\nthe body’s responsiveness to changing\n\nconditions. Neurons, the unit of neural\n\nsystem are excitable cells (Figure 7.8). The\n\nneuroglial cell which constitute the rest of\n\nthe neural system protect and support\n\nneurons. Neuroglia make up more than one-\n\nhalf the volume of neural tissue in our body.\n\nWhen a neuron is suitably stimulated,\n\nan electrical disturbance is generated\n\nwhich swiftly travels along its plasma\n\nNucleus\n\nStriations\n\nJunction\nbetween\nadjacent\n\ncells\n\nNucleus\n\nStriationsSmooth\nmuscle\nfibers\n\nFigure 7.7 Muscle tissue : (a) Skeletal (striated) muscle tissue (b) Smooth muscle tissue\n(c) Cardiac muscle tissue\n\n(a) (b) (c)\n\nFigure 7.8 Neural tissue (Neuron with\nneuroglea)\n\nDendrite\n\nCell\nbody\nwith\n\nnucleus\n\nAxon\n\nNeuroglea\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n106 BIOLOGY\n\nmembrane. Arrival of the disturbance at the neuron’s endings, or output\n\nzone, triggers events that may cause stimulation or inhibition of adjacent\n\nneurons and other cells (You will study the details in Chapter 21).\n\n7.2 ORGAN AND ORGAN SYSTEM\n\nThe basic tissues mentioned above organise to form organs which in turn\n\nassociate to form organ systems in the multicellular organisms. Such an\n\norganisation is essential for more efficient and better coordinated activities\n\nof millions of cells constituting an organism. Each organ in our body is\n\nmade of one or more type of tissues. For example, our heart consists of all\n\nthe four types of tissues, i.e., epithelial, connective, muscular and neural.\n\nWe also notice, after some careful study that the complexity in organ and\n\norgan systems displays certain discernable trend. This discernable trend\n\nis called evolutionary trend (You will study the details in class XII). You\n\nare being introduced to morphology and anatomy of three organisms at\n\ndifferent evolutionary levels to show their organisation and functioning.\n\nMorphology refers to study of form or externally visible features. In the\n\ncase of plants or microbes, the term morphology precisely means only\n\nthis. In case of animals this refers to the external appearance of the organs\n\nor parts of the body. The word anatomy conventionally is used for the\n\nstudy of morphology of internal organs in the animals. You will learn the\n\nmorphology and anatomy of earthworm, cockroach and frog representing\n\ninvertebrates and vertebrates.\n\n7.3 EARTHWORM\n\nEarthworm is a reddish brown terrestrial invertebrate that inhabits the\n\nupper layer of the  moist soil. During day time, they live in burrows made\n\nby boring and swallowing the soil. In the gardens, they can be traced by\n\ntheir faecal deposits known as worm castings. The common Indian\n\nearthworms are Pheretima  and Lumbricus.\n\n7.3.1 Morphology\n\nEarthworms have long cylindrical body. The body is divided into more\n\nthan hundred short segments which are similar (metameres about\n\n100-120 in number). The dorsal surface of the body is marked by a dark\n\nmedian mid dorsal line (dorsal blood vessel) along the longitudinal axis of\n\nthe body. The ventral surface is distinguished by the presence of genital\n\nopenings (pores). Anterior end consists of the mouth and the prostomium,\n\na lobe which serves as a covering for the mouth and as a wedge to force\n\nopen cracks in the soil into which the earthworm may crawl. The prostomium\n\nis sensory in function. The first body segment is called the peristomium\n\n(buccal segment) which contains the mouth. In a mature worm, segments\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSTRUCTURAL ORGANISATION IN ANIMALS 107\n\n14-16 are covered by a prominent dark band of glandular tissue called\n\nclitellum. Thus the body is divisible into three prominent regions –\n\npreclitellar, clitellar and postclitellar segments (Figure 7.9).\n\nFour pairs of spermathecal apertures are situated on the ventro-lateral\n\nsides of the intersegmental  grooves, i.e., 5th -9th  segments. A single female\n\ngenital pore is present in the mid-ventral line of 14th segment. A pair of\n\nmale genital pores are present on the ventro-lateral sides of the 18th\n\nsegment. Numerous minute pores called nephridiopores open on the\n\nsurface of the body. In each body segment, except the first, last and\n\nclitellum, there are rows of S-shaped setae, embedded in the epidermal\n\npits in the middle of each segment. Setae can be extended or retracted.\n\nTheir principal role is in locomotion.\n\n7.3.2 Anatomy\n\nThe body wall of the earthworm is covered externally by a thin non-cellular\n\ncuticle below which is the epidermis, two muscle layers (circular and\n\nlongitudinal) and an innermost coelomic epithelium. The epidermis is made\n\nFigure 7.9 Body of earthworm : (a) dorsal view (b) ventral view (c) lateral view\nshowing mouth opening\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n108 BIOLOGY\n\nup of a single layer of columnar epithelial cells\n\nwhich contain secretory gland cells.\n\nThe alimentary canal is a straight tube and\n\nruns between first to last segment of the body.\n\n(Figure 7.10). A terminal mouth opens into the\n\nbuccal cavity (1-3 segments) which leads into\n\nmuscular pharynx. A small narrow tube,\n\noesophagus (5-7 segments), continues into a\n\nmuscular gizzard (8-9 segments). It helps in\n\ngrinding the soil particles and decaying leaves,\n\netc. The stomach extends from 9-14 segments.\n\nThe food of the earthworm is decaying leaves and\n\norganic matter mixed with soil. Calciferous\n\nglands, present in the stomach, neutralise the\n\nhumic acid present in humus. Intestine starts\n\nfrom the 15th segment onwards and continues\n\ntill the last segment. A pair of short and conical\n\nintestinal caecae project from the intestine on the\n\n26th segment. The characteristic feature of the\n\nintestine after 26th segment except the last\n\n23rd-25th segments is the presence of internal\n\nmedian fold of dorsal wall called typhlosole. This\n\nincreases the effective area of absorption in the\n\nintestine. The alimentary canal opens to the\n\nexterior by a small rounded aperture called anus.\n\nThe ingested organic rich soil passes through the\n\ndigestive tract where digestive enzymes\n\nbreakdown complex food into smaller absorbable\n\nunits. These simpler molecules are absorbed\n\nthrough intestinal membranes and are utilised.\n\nPheretima  exhibits a closed type of\n\nblood vascular system, consisting of blood\n\nvessels, capillaries and heart. (Figure 7.11). Due\n\nto closed circulatory system, blood is confined\n\nto the heart and blood vessels. Contractions\n\nkeep blood circulating in one direction. Smaller\n\nblood vessels supply the gut, nerve cord, and\n\nthe body wall. Blood glands are present on the\n\n4th, 5th and 6th segments. They produce blood\n\ncells and haemoglobin which is dissolved in\n\nblood plasma. Blood cells are phagocytic in\n\nnature. Earthworms lack specialised breathing\n\ndevices.

They are of three types:\n\n(i) septal nephridia, present on both the sides of\n\nintersegmental septa of segment 15 to the last\n\nthat open into intestine, (ii) integumentary\n\nnephridia, attached to lining of the body wall of\n\nsegment 3 to the last that open on the body\n\nsurface and (iii) pharyngeal  nephridia, present\n\nas  three paired tufts in the 4th, 5th and 6th\n\nsegments (Figure 7.12). These different types of\n\nnephridia are basically similar in structure.\n\nNephridia regulate the volume and composition\n\nof the body fluids. A nephridium  starts out as a\n\nfunnel that collects excess fluid from coelomic\n\nchamber. The funnel connects with a tubular part\n\nof the nephridium which delivers the wastes\n\nthrough a pore to the surface in the body wall\n\ninto the digestive tube.\n\nNervous system is basically represented by\n\nganglia arranged segmentwise on the ventral\n\npaired nerve cord. The nerve cord in the anterior\n\nregion (3rd  and 4th  segments) bifurcates, laterally\n\nencircling the pharynx and joins the cerebral\n\nganglia dorsally to form a nerve ring. The cerebral\n\nganglia alongwith other nerves in the ring\n\nintegrate sensory input as well as command\n\nmuscular responses of the body.\n\nFigure 7.11 Closed circulatory system\n\nFigure 7.12 Nephridial system in earthworm\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n110 BIOLOGY\n\nSensory system does not have eyes but does\n\npossess light and touch sensitive organs (receptor\n\ncells) to distinguish the light intensities and to feel\n\nthe vibrations in the ground. Worms have\n\nspecialised chemoreceptors (taste receptors) which\n\nreact to chemical stimuli. These sense organs are\n\nlocated on the anterior part of the worm.\n\nEarthworm is hermaphrodite (bisexual), i.e.,\n\ntestes and ovaries are present in the same\n\nindividual (Figure 7.13). There are two pairs of\n\ntestes present in the 10th and 11th segments.\n\nTheir vasa deferentia run up to  the 18th segment\n\nwhere they join the prostatic duct. Two pairs of\n\naccessory glands are present one pair each in\n\nthe 17th and 19th segments. The common prostate\n\nand spermatic duct (vasa deferentia) opens to\n\nthe exterior by a pair of male genital pores on\n\nthe ventro-lateral side of the 18th segment. Four\n\npairs of spermathecae are located in 6th-9th\n\nsegments (one pair in each segment). They receive\n\nand store spermatozoa during copulation. One\n\npair of ovaries is attached at the inter-segmental\n\nseptum of the 12th and 13th segments. Ovarian\n\nfunnels are present beneath the ovaries which\n\ncontinue into oviduct, join together and open on\n\nthe ventral side as a single median female genital\n\npore on the 14th segment.\n\nA mutual exchange of sperm occurs between\n\ntwo worms during mating. One worm has to find\n\nanother worm and they mate juxtaposing\n\nopposite gonadal openings exchanging packets\n\nof sperms called spermatophores. Mature sperm\n\nand egg cells and nutritive fluid are deposited in\n\ncocoons produced by the gland cells of clitellum.\n\nFertilisation and development occur within the\n\ncocoons which are deposited in soil. The ova\n\n(eggs) are fertilised by the sperm cells within the\n\ncocoon which then slips off the worm and is\n\ndeposited in or on the soil. The cocoon holds the\n\nworm embryos. After about 3 weeks, each cocoon\n\nproduces two to twenty baby worms with an\n\naverage of four. Development of earthworms is\n\ndirect, i.e., there is no larva formed.\n\nFigure 7.13  Reproductive system of earthworm\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSTRUCTURAL ORGANISATION IN ANIMALS 111\n\nEarthworms are known as ‘friends of farmers’ because they make\n\nburrows in the soil and make it porous which helps in respiration and\n\npenetration of the developing plant roots. The process of increasing fertility\n\nof soil by the earthworms is called vermicomposting. They are also used\n\nas bait in game fishing.\n\n7.4 COCKROACH\n\nCockroaches are brown or black bodied animals that are included in\n\nclass Insecta of Phylum Arthropoda. Bright yellow, red and green coloured\n\ncockroaches have also been reported in tropical regions. Their size ranges\n\nfrom ¼ inches to 3 inches (0.6-7.6 cm) and have long antenna, legs and\n\nflat extension of the upper body wall that conceals head. They are\n\nnocturnal omnivores that live in damp places throughout the world. They\n\nhave become residents of human homes and thus are serious pests and\n\nvectors of several diseases.\n\n7.4.1 Morphology\n\nThe adults of the common species of cockroach, Periplaneta americana\n\nare about 34-53 mm long with wings that extend beyond the tip of the\n\nabdomen in males. The body of the cockroach is segmented and divisible\n\ninto three distinct regions – head, thorax and abdomen (Figure 7.14).\n\nThe entire body is covered by a hard chitinous exoskeleton (brown in\n\ncolour). In each segment, exoskeleton has hardened plates called sclerites\n\n(tergites dorsally and sternites ventrally) that are joined to each other by\n\na thin and flexible articular membrane (arthrodial membrane).\n\nFigure 7.14  External features of cockroach\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n112 BIOLOGY\n\nHead is triangular in shape and lies anteriorly at right angles to the\n\nlongitudinal body axis. It is formed by the fusion of  six segments and\n\nshows great mobility in all directions due to flexible neck (Figure 7.15).\n\nThe head capsule bears a pair of compound eyes. A pair of  thread like\n\nantennae arise from membranous sockets lying in front of eyes. Antennae\n\nhave sensory receptors that help in monitoring the environment. Anterior\n\nend of the head bears appendages forming biting and chewing type of\n\nmouth parts. The mouthparts consisting of  a labrum (upper lip), a pair\n\nof mandibles, a pair of maxillae and a labium (lower lip). A median flexible\n\nlobe, acting as tongue (hypopharynx), lies within the cavity enclosed by\n\nthe mouthparts (Figure 7.15b). Thorax consists of three parts – prothorax,\n\nmesothorax and metathorax.  The head is connected with thorax  by a\n\nshort extension of the prothorax known as the neck. Each thoracic segment\n\nbears a pair of walking legs. The first pair of wings arises from mesothorax\n\nand the second pair from metathorax. Forewings (mesothoracic) called\n\ntegmina are opaque dark and  leathery and cover the hind wings when at\n\nrest. The hind wings are transparent, membranous and are used in flight.\n\nThe abdomen in both males and females consists of 10 segments. In\n\nfemales,  the 7th sternum is boat shaped and together with the 8th and 9th\n\nsterna forms a brood or genital pouch whose anterior part contains female\n\ngonopore, spermathecal pores and collateral glands. In males, genital pouch\n\nor chamber lies at the hind end of abdomen bounded dorsally by 9th and\n\n10th terga and ventrally by the 9th sternum. It contains dorsal anus, ventral\n\nmale genital pore and gonapophysis. Males bear a pair of short, thread-\n\nlike anal styles which are absent in females. In both sexes, the 10th segment\n\nbears a pair of jointed filamentous structures called anal cerci.\n\nOcellus\nCompound eye\n\nMandible\n\nMaxilla\n\nLabrum\n\nLabium(a)\n\nFigure 7.15  Head region of cockroach :  (a) parts of head region  (b) mouth parts\n\nGrinding\nregion\n\nIncising\nregionMandible\n\nMaxilla\n\nLabrum\n\nHypopharynx\n\nLabium\n\nMandible\n\nMaxilla\n\n(b)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSTRUCTURAL ORGANISATION IN ANIMALS 113\n\n7.4.2 Anatomy\n\nThe alimentary canal present in the body cavity\n\nis divided into three regions: foregut, midgut\n\nand hindgut (Figure 7.16). The mouth opens\n\ninto a short tubular pharynx, leading to a\n\nnarrow tubular passage called oesophagus.\n\nThis in turn opens into a sac like structure\n\ncalled crop used for storing of food. The crop\n\nis followed by gizzard or proventriculus. It has\n\nan outer layer of thick circular muscles and\n\nthick inner cuticle forming six highly chitinous\n\nplate called teeth. Gizzard helps in grinding the\n\nfood particles. The entire foregut is lined by\n\ncuticle. A ring of 6-8 blind tubules called\n\nhepatic or gastric caeca is present at the\n\njunction of foregut and midgut, which secrete\n\ndigestive juice. At the junction of midgut and\n\nhindgut is present another ring of 100-150\n\nyellow coloured thin filamentous Malpighian\n\ntubules. They help in removal of excretory\n\nproducts from haemolymph. The hindgut is\n\nbroader than midgut and is differentiated into\n\nileum, colon and rectum. The rectum opens\n\nout through anus.\n\nBlood vascular system of cockroach is an\n\nopen type (Figure 7.17). Blood vessels are\n\npoorly developed and open into space\n\n(haemocoel). Visceral organs located in the\n\nhaemocoel are bathed in blood (haemolymph).\n\nThe haemolymph is composed of colourless\n\nplasma and haemocytes. Heart of cockroach\n\nconsists of elongated muscular tube lying\n\nalong mid dorsal line of thorax and abdomen.\n\nIt is differentiated into funnel shaped chambers\n\nwith ostia on either side. Blood from sinuses\n\nenter heart through ostia and is pumped\n\nanteriorly to sinuses again.\n\nThe respiratory system consists of a\n\nnetwork of trachea, that open through 10 pairs\n\nof small holes called spiracles present on the\n\nlateral side of the body. Thin branching tubes\n\n(tracheal tubes subdivided into tracheoles)\n\ncarry oxygen from the air to all the parts.

Exchange of gases\n\ntake place at the tracheoles by diffusion.\n\nExcretion is performed by Malpighian tubules. Each tubule is lined\n\nby glandular and ciliated cells. They absorb nitrogenous waste products\n\nand convert them into uric acid which is excreted out through the hindgut.\n\nTherefore, this insect is called uricotelic. In addition, the fat body,\n\nnephrocytes and urecose glands also help in excretion.\n\nThe nervous system of cockroach consists of a series of fused,\n\nsegmentally arranged ganglia joined by paired longitudinal connectives\n\non the ventral side. Three ganglia lie in the thorax, and six in the abdomen.\n\nThe nervous system of cockroach is spread throughout the body. The\n\nhead holds a bit of a nervous system while the rest is situated along the\n\nventral (belly-side) part of its body. So, now you understand that if the\n\nhead of a cockroach is cut off, it will still live for as long as one week. In\n\nthe head region, the brain is represented by supra-oesophageal ganglion\n\nwhich supplies nerves to antennae and compound eyes. In cockroach,\n\nthe sense organs are antennae, eyes, maxillary palps, labial palps, anal\n\ncerci, etc. The compound eyes are situated at the dorsal surface of the\n\nhead. Each eye consists of about 2000 hexagonal ommatidia\n\n(sing.: ommatidium). With the help of several ommatidia, a cockroach can\n\nreceive several images of an object. This kind of vision is known as mosaic\n\nvision with more sensitivity but less resolution, being common during\n\nnight (hence called nocturnal vision).\n\nCockroaches are dioecious and both sexes have well developed\n\nreproductive organs (Figure 7.18). Male reproductive system consists of\n\na pair of testes one lying on each lateral side in the 4th -6th  abdominal\n\nsegments. From each testis arises a thin vas deferens, which opens into\n\nejaculatory duct through seminal vesicle. The ejaculatory duct opens into\n\nmale gonopore situated ventral to anus. A characteristic  mushroom-\n\nshaped gland is present in the 6th-7th abdominal segments which functions\n\nas an accessory reproductive gland. The external genitalia are represented\n\nby male gonapophysis or phallomere (chitinous asymmetrical structures,\n\nsurrounding the male gonopore). The sperms are stored in the seminal\n\nvesicles and are glued together in the form of bundles called\n\nspermatophores which are discharged during copulation. The female\n\nreproductive sysytem consists of two large ovaries,  lying laterally in the\n\n2nd – 6th abdominal segments. Each ovary is formed of a group of eight\n\novarian tubules or ovarioles, containing a chain of developing ova.\n\nOviducts of each ovary unite into a single median oviduct (also called\n\nvagina) which opens into the genital chamber. A pair of spermatheca is\n\npresent in the 6th segment which opens into the genital chamber.\n\nSperms are transferred through spermatophores. Their fertilised eggs\n\nare encased in capsules called oothecae. Ootheca is a dark reddish to\n\nblackish brown capsule, about 3/8" (8 mm) long. They are dropped or\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSTRUCTURAL ORGANISATION IN ANIMALS 115\n\nglued to a suitable surface, usually in a crack or crevice of high relative\n\nhumidity near a food source. On an average, females produce 9-10\n\noothecae, each containing 14-16 eggs. The development of P. americana\n\nis paurometabolous, meaning there is development through nymphal\n\nstage. The nymphs look very much like adults. The nymph grows by\n\nmoulting about 13 times to reach the adult form. The next to last nymphal\n\nstage has wing pads but only adult cockroaches have wings.\n\nMany species of cockroaches are wild and are of no known economic\n\nimportance yet. A few species thrive in and around human habitat. They are\n\npests because they spoil food and contaminate it with their smelly excreta.\n\nThey can transmit a variety of bacterial diseases by contaminating food material.\n\nTestis\n\nPhallic gland\n\nSmall tubules\n\nLong tubules\n\nSeminal vesicle\n\nVas deferens\n\nEjaculatory duct\n\nRight phallomere\n\nVentral phallomere\n\nAnal cercus\n\nCaudal style\nPseudopenis\n\nTitillator\n\nLeft phallomere\n\nOvary\n\nOviduct\n\nCommon oviduct\nor vagina\n\nCollaterial glands\n\nGenital chamber\n\nVestibulum\n\nGenital\npouch\n\nSpermatheca\n\ngonapophyses\n]\n\nFigure 7.18  Reproductive system of cockroach :  (a) male  (b) female\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n116 BIOLOGY\n\n7.5 FROGS\n\nFrogs can live both on land and in freshwater and belong to class\n\nAmphibia of phylum Chordata. The most common species of frog found\n\nin India is Rana tigrina.\n\nThey do not have constant body temperature i.e., their body\n\ntemperature varies with the temperature of the environment. Such animals\n\nare called cold blooded or poikilotherms. You might have also noticed\n\nchanges in the colour of the frogs while they are in grasses and on dry\n\nland. They have the ability to change the colour to hide them from their\n\nenemies (camouflage). This protective coloration is called mimicry.  You\n\nmay also know that frogs are not seen during peak summer and winter.\n\nDuring this period they take shelter in deep burrows to protect them\n\nfrom extreme heat and cold. This is known as summer sleep (aestivation)\n\nand winter sleep (hibernation) respectively.\n\n7.5.1 Morphology\n\nHave you ever touched the skin of frog? The skin is smooth and slippery\n\ndue to the presence of mucus. The skin is always maintained in a moist\n\ncondition. The colour of dorsal side of body is generally olive green with\n\ndark irregular spots.  On the ventral side the skin is uniformly pale yellow.\n\nThe frog never drinks water but absorb it through the skin.\n\nBody of a frog is divisible into head and trunk (Figure 7.19). A neck\n\nand tail are absent. Above the mouth, a pair of nostrils is present.  Eyes\n\nare bulged and covered by a nictitating membrane that protects them\n\nwhile in water. On either side of eyes a membranous\n\ntympanum (ear) receives sound signals. The\n\nforelimbs and hind limbs help in swimming,\n\nwalking, leaping and burrowing. The hind limbs end\n\nin five digits and they are larger and muscular than\n\nfore limbs that end in four digits. Feet have webbed\n\ndigits that help in swimming. Frogs exhibit sexual\n\ndimorphism. Male frogs can be distinguished by the\n\npresence of sound producing vocal sacs and also a\n\ncopulatory pad on the first digit of the fore limbs\n\nwhich are absent in female frogs.\n\n7.5.2 Anatomy\n\nThe body cavity of frogs accommodate different organ systems such as\n\ndigestive, circulatory, respiratory, nervous, excretory and reproductive\n\nsystems with well developed structures and functions  (Figure 7.20).\n\nThe digestive system consists of alimentary canal and digestive glands.\n\nThe alimentary canal is short because frogs are carnivores and hence the\n\nlength of intestine is reduced. The mouth opens into the buccal cavity that\n\nFigure 7.19  External features of frog\n\nEye\n\nFore limb\n\nHind limb\n\nHead\nTrunk\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSTRUCTURAL ORGANISATION IN ANIMALS 117\n\nleads to the oesophagus through pharynx. Oesophagus is a short tube\n\nthat opens into the stomach which in turn continues as the intestine, rectum\n\nand finally opens outside by the cloaca.  Liver secretes bile that is stored in\n\nthe gall bladder. Pancreas, a digestive gland produces pancreatic juice\n\ncontaining digestive enzymes. Food is captured by the bilobed tongue.\n\nDigestion of food takes place by the action of HCl and gastric juices secreted\n\nfrom  the walls of the stomach. Partially digested food called chyme is passed\n\nfrom stomach to the first part of the small intestine, the duodenum. The\n\nduodenum receives bile from gall bladder and pancreatic juices from the\n\npancreas through a common bile duct. Bile emulsifies fat and pancreatic\n\njuices digest carbohydrates and proteins. Final digestion takes place in the\n\nintestine. Digested food is absorbed by the numerous finger-like folds in\n\nthe inner wall of intestine called villi and microvilli. The undigested solid\n\nwaste moves into the rectum and passes out through cloaca.\n\nFrogs respire on land and in the water by two different methods. In\n\nwater, skin acts as aquatic respiratory organ (cutaneous respiration).\n\nDissolved oxygen in the water is exchanged through the skin by diffusion.\n\nFigure 7.20 Diagrammatic representation of internal organs of frog showing\ncomplete digestive system\n\nIntestineUreter\n\nRectum\n\nCloaca\n\nUrinary\nbladder\n\nOesophagus\n\nLiver\n\nStomach\n\nKidney\n\nGall\nbladder\n\nFat bodies\n\nLung\n\nHeart\n\nCloacal Aperture\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n118 BIOLOGY\n\nOn land, the buccal cavity, skin and lungs act as the respiratory organs.\n\nThe respiration by lungs is called pulmonary respiration. The lungs are\n\na pair of elongated, pink coloured sac-like structures present in the upper\n\npart of the trunk region (thorax). Air enters through the nostrils into the\n\nbuccal cavity and then to lungs. During aestivation and hibernation\n\ngaseous exchange takes place through skin.\n\nThe vascular system of frog is well-developed closed type. Frogs have\n\na lymphatic system also. The blood vascular system involves heart, blood\n\nvessels and blood. The lymphatic system consists of lymph, lymph\n\nchannels and lymph nodes. Heart is a muscular structure situated in the\n\nupper part of the body cavity. It has three chambers, two atria and one\n\nventricle and is covered by a membrane called pericardium. A triangular\n\nstructure called sinus venosus joins the right atrium. It receives blood\n\nthrough the major veins called vena cava. The ventricle opens into a sac-\n\nlike conus arteriosus on the ventral side of the heart. The blood from the\n\nheart is carried to all parts of the body by the arteries (arterial system).\n\nThe veins collect blood from different parts of body to the heart and form\n\nthe venous system. Special venous connection between liver and intestine\n\nas well as the kidney and lower parts of the body are present in frogs. The\n\nformer is called hepatic portal system and the latter is called renal portal\n\nsystem. The blood is composed of plasma and cells. The blood cells are\n\nRBC (red blood cells) or erythrocytes, WBC (white blood cells) or leucocytes\n\nand platelets. RBC’s are nucleated and contain red coloured pigment\n\nnamely haemoglobin. The lymph is different from blood. It lacks few\n\nproteins and RBCs. The blood carries nutrients, gases and water to the\n\nrespective sites during the circulation. The circulation of blood is achieved\n\nby the pumping action of the muscular heart.\n\nThe elimination of nitrogenous wastes is carried out by a well\n\ndeveloped excretory system. The excretory system consists of a pair of\n\nkidneys, ureters, cloaca and urinary bladder. These are compact, dark\n\nred and bean like structures situated a little posteriorly in the body cavity\n\non both sides of vertebral column. Each kidney is composed of several\n\nstructural and functional units called uriniferous tubules or nephrons.\n\nTwo ureters emerge from the kidneys in the male frogs. The ureters act as\n\nurinogenital duct which opens into the cloaca. In females the ureters and\n\noviduct open seperately in the cloaca. The thin-walled urinary bladder is\n\npresent ventral to the rectum which also opens in the cloaca. The frog\n\nexcretes urea and thus is a ureotelic animal. Excretory wastes are carried\n\nby blood into the kidney where it is separated and excreted.\n\nThe system for control and coordination is highly evolved in the frog. It\n\nincludes both neural system and endocrine glands. The chemical\n\ncoordination of various organs of the body is achieved by hormones which\n\nare secreted by the endocrine glands. The prominent endocrine glands\n\nfound in frog are pituitary, thyroid, parathyroid, thymus, pineal body,\n\npancreatic islets, adrenals and gonads. The nervous system is organised\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSTRUCTURAL ORGANISATION IN ANIMALS 119\n\ninto a central nervous system (brain and spinal\n\ncord), a peripheral nervous system (cranial and\n\nspinal nerves) and an autonomic nervous system\n\n(sympathetic and parasympathetic). There are ten\n\npairs of cranial nerves arising from the brain. Brain\n\nis enclosed in a bony structure called brain box\n\n(cranium). The brain is divided into fore-brain,\n\nmid-brain and hind-brain. Forebrain includes\n\nolfactory lobes, paired cerebral hemispheres and\n\nunpaired diencephalon. The midbrain is\n\ncharacterised by a pair of optic lobes. Hind-brain\n\nconsists of cerebellum and medulla oblongata.\n\nThe medulla oblongata passes out through the\n\nforamen magnum and continues into spinal cord,\n\nwhich is enclosed in the vertebral column.\n\nFrog has different types of sense organs, namely\n\norgans of touch (sensory papillae), taste (taste\n\nbuds), smell (nasal epithelium), vision (eyes) and\n\nhearing (tympanum with internal ears). Out of\n\nthese, eyes and internal ears are well-organised\n\nstructures and the rest are cellular aggregations\n\naround nerve endings. Eyes in a frog are a pair of\n\nspherical structures situated in the orbit in skull.\n\nThese are simple eyes (possessing only one unit).\n\nExternal ear is absent in frogs and only tympanum\n\ncan be seen externally. The ear is an organ of\n\nhearing as well as balancing (equilibrium).\n\nFrogs have well organised male and female\n\nreproductive systems. Male reproductive organs\n\nconsist of a pair of yellowish ovoid testes (Figure\n\n7.21), which are found adhered to the upper part\n\nof kidneys by a double fold of peritoneum called\n\nmesorchium. Vasa efferentia are 10-12 in\n\nnumber that arise from testes. They enter the\n\nkidneys on their side and open into Bidder’s\n\ncanal. Finally it communicates with the\n\nurinogenital duct that comes out of the kidneys\n\nand opens into the cloaca. The cloaca is a small,\n\nmedian chamber that is used to pass faecal\n\nmatter, urine and sperms to the exterior.\n\nThe female reproductive organs include a pair\n\nof ovaries (Figure 7.22). The ovaries are situated\n\nnear kidneys and there is no functional\n\nconnection with kidneys.

A mature female can\n\nlay 2500 to 3000 ova at a time. Fertilisation is external and takes place in\n\nwater. Development involves a larval stage called tadpole. Tadpole\n\nundergoes metamorphosis to form the adult.\n\nFrogs are beneficial for mankind because they eat insects and protect\n\nthe crop. Frogs maintain ecological balance because these serve as an\n\nimportant link of food chain and food web in the ecosystem. In some\n\ncountries the muscular legs of frog are used as food by man.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nCells, tissues, organs and organ systems split up the work in a way that ensures\n\nthe survival of the body as a whole and exhibit division of labour. A tissue is\n\ndefined as group of cells along with intercellular substances performing one or\n\nmore functions in the body. Epithelia are sheet like tissues lining the body’s surface\n\nand its cavities, ducts and tubes. Epithelia have one free surface facing a body\n\nfluid or the outside environment. Their cells are structurally and functionally\n\nconnected at junctions.\n\nDiverse types of connective tissues bind together, support, strengthen, protect,\n\nand insulate other tissue in the body. Soft connective tissues consist of protein\n\nfibres as well as a variety of cells arranged in a ground substance. Cartilage, bone,\n\nblood, and adipose tissue are specialised connective tissues. Cartilage and bone\n\nare both structural materials. Blood is a fluid tissue with transport functions.\n\nAdipose tissue is a reservoir of stored energy. Muscle tissue, which can contract\n\n(shorten) in response to stimulation, helps in movement of the body and specific\n\nbody parts. Skeletal muscle is the muscle tissue attached to bones. Smooth muscle\n\nis a component of internal organs. Cardiac muscle makes up the contractile walls\n\nof the heart. Connective tissue covers all three types of tissues. Nervous tissue\n\nexerts greatest control over the response of body. Neurons are the basic units of\n\nnervous tissue.\n\nEarthworm, Cockroach and Frog show characteristic features in body\n\norganisation. In Pheretima posthuma (earthworm), the body is covered by cuticle.\n\nAll segments of its body are alike except the 14th, 15th and 16th segment, which are\n\nthick and dark and glandular, forming clitellum. A ring of S-shaped chitinous\n\nsetae is found in each segment. These setae help in locomotion. On the ventral\n\nside spermathecal openings are present in between the grooves of 5 and 6, 6 and\n\n7, 7 and 8 and 8 and 9 segments. Female genital pores are present on 14th segment\n\nand male genital pores on 18th segment. The alimentary canal is a narrow tube\n\nmade of mouth, buccal cavity, pharynx, gizzard, stomach, intestine and anus.\n\nThe blood vascular system is of closed type with heart and valves. Nervous system\n\nis represented by ventral nerve cord. Earthworm is hermaphorodite. Two pairs of\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nSTRUCTURAL ORGANISATION IN ANIMALS 121\n\ntestes occur in the 10th and 11th segment, respectively. A pair of ovaries are present\n\non 12 and 13th intersegmental septum. It is a protandrous animal with cross-\n\nfertilisation. Fertilisation and development take place in cocoon secreted by the\n\nglands of clitellum.\n\nThe body of Cockroach (Periplaneta americana) is covered by chitinous\n\nexoskeleton. It is divided into head, thorax and abdomen. Segments bear jointed\n\nappendages. There are three segments of thorax, each bearing a pair of walking\n\nlegs. Two pairs of wings are present, one pair each on 2nd and 3rd segment. There\n\nare ten segments in abdomen. Alimentary canal is well developed with a mouth\n\nsurrounded by mouth parts, a pharynx, oesophagus, crop, gizzard, midgut,\n\nhindgut and anus. Hepatic caecae are present at the junction of foregut and\n\nmidgut. Malpighian tubules are present at the junction of midgut and hindgut\n\nand help in excretion. A pair of salivary gland is present near crop. The blood\n\nvascular system is of open type. Respiration takes place by network of tracheae.\n\nTrachea opens outside with spiracles. Nervous system is represented by\n\nsegmentally arranged ganglia and ventral nerve cord. A pair of testes is present in\n\n4th-6th segments and ovaries in 2nd-6th segments. Fertilisation is internal.

The detailed description of\ntheir form and appearance only brought out their diversity. It is the\ncell theory that emphasised the unity underlying this diversity of forms,\ni.e., the cellular organisation of all life forms. A description of cell\nstructure and cell growth by division is given in the chapters comprising\nthis unit. Cell theory also created a sense of mystery around living\nphenomena, i.e., physiological and behavioural processes. This mystery\nwas the requirement of integrity of cellular organisation for living\nphenomena to be demonstrated or observed. In studying and\nunderstanding the physiological and behavioural processes, one can\ntake a physico-chemical approach and use cell-free systems to\ninvestigate. This approach enables us to describe the various processes\nin molecular terms. The approach is established by analysis of living\ntissues for elements and compounds. It will tell us what types of organic\ncompounds are present in living organisms. In the next stage, one can\nask the question: What are these compounds doing inside a cell? And,\nin what way they carry out gross physiological processes like digestion,\nexcretion, memory, defense, recognition, etc. In other words we answer\nthe question, what is the molecular basis of all physiological processes?\nIt can also explain the abnormal processes that occur during any\ndiseased condition. This physico-chemical approach to study and\nunderstand living organisms is called ‘Reductionist Biology’. The\nconcepts and techniques of physics and chemistry are applied to\nunderstand biology. In Chapter 9 of this unit, a brief description of\nbiomolecules is provided.\n\nCELL: STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONS\n\nChapter 8\nCell: The Unit of Life\n\nChapter 9\nBiomolecules\n\nChapter 10\nCell Cycle and\nCell Division\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nG.N. RAMACHANDRAN, an outstanding figure in the field of protein\nstructure, was the founder of the ‘Madras school’ of\nconformational analysis of biopolymers. His discovery of the triple\nhelical structure of collagen published in Nature in 1954 and his\nanalysis of the allowed conformations of proteins through the\nuse of the ‘Ramachandran plot’ rank among the most outstanding\ncontributions in structural biology. He was born on October 8,\n1922, in a small town, not far from Cochin on the southwestern\ncoast of India. His father was a professor of mathematics at a\nlocal college and thus had considerable influence in shaping\nRamachandran’s interest in mathematics. After completing his\nschool years, Ramachandran graduated in 1942 as the top-\nranking student in the B.Sc. (Honors) Physics course of the\nUniversity of Madras. He received a Ph.D. from Cambridge\nUniversity in 1949. While at Cambridge, Ramachandran met\nLinus Pauling and was deeply influenced by his publications on\nmodels of the α-helix and β-sheet structures that directed his\nattention to solving the structure of collagen. He passed away at\nthe age of 78, on April 7, 2001.G.N. Ramachandran\n\n(1922 – 2001)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nWhen you look around, you see both living and non-living things. You\n\nmust have wondered and asked yourself – ‘what is it that makes an\n\norganism living, or what is it that an inanimate thing does not have which\n\na living thing has’ ? The answer to this is the presence of the basic unit of\n\nlife – the cell in all living organisms.\n\nAll organisms are composed of cells. Some are composed of a single\ncell and are called unicellular organisms while others, like us, composed\nof many cells, are called multicellular organisms.\n\n8.1 WHAT IS A CELL?\n\nUnicellular organisms are capable of (i) independent existence and\n\n(ii) performing the essential functions of life. Anything less than a complete\n\nstructure of a cell does not ensure independent living. Hence, cell is the\n\nfundamental structural and functional unit of all living organisms.\n\nAnton Von Leeuwenhoek first saw and described a live cell. Robert\n\nBrown later discovered the nucleus. The invention of the microscope and\n\nits improvement leading to the electron microscope revealed all the\n\nstructural details of the cell.\n\n8.2 CELL THEORY\n\nIn 1838, Matthias Schleiden, a German botanist, examined a large number\n\nof plants and observed that all plants are composed of different kinds of\n\ncells which form the tissues of the plant. At about the same time, Theodore\n\nCELL: THE UNIT OF LIFE\n\nCHAPTER  8\n\n8.1 What is a Cell?\n\n8.2 Cell Theory\n\n8.3 An Overview of\n\nCell\n\n8.4 Prokaryotic Cells\n\n8.5 Eukaryotic Cells\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n126 BIOLOGY\n\nSchwann (1839), a British Zoologist, studied different types of animal cells\n\nand reported that cells had a thin outer layer which is today known as the\n\n‘plasma membrane’. He also concluded, based on his studies on plant\n\ntissues, that the presence of cell wall is a unique character of the plant\n\ncells. On the basis of this, Schwann proposed the hypothesis that the bodies\n\nof animals and plants are composed of cells and products of cells.\n\nSchleiden and Schwann together formulated the cell theory. This theory\n\nhowever, did not explain as to how new cells were formed. Rudolf Virchow\n\n(1855) first explained that cells divided and new cells are formed from\n\npre-existing cells (Omnis cellula-e cellula). He modified the hypothesis of\n\nSchleiden and Schwann to give the cell theory a final shape. Cell theory\n\nas understood today is:\n\n(i) all living organisms are composed of cells and products of cells.\n\n(ii) all cells arise from pre-existing cells.\n\n8.3 AN OVERVIEW OF CELL\n\nYou have earlier observed cells in an onion peel and/or human cheek\n\ncells under the microscope. Let us recollect their structure. The onion cell\n\nwhich is a typical plant cell, has a distinct cell wall as its outer boundary\n\nand just within it is the cell membrane. The cells of the human cheek\n\nhave an outer membrane as the delimiting structure of the cell. Inside\n\neach cell is a dense membrane bound structure called nucleus. This\n\nnucleus contains the chromosomes which in turn contain the genetic\n\nmaterial, DNA. Cells that have membrane bound nuclei are called\n\neukaryotic whereas cells that lack a membrane bound nucleus are\n\nprokaryotic. In both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, a semi-fluid matrix\n\ncalled cytoplasm occupies the volume of the cell. The cytoplasm is the\n\nmain arena of cellular activities in both the plant and animal cells. Various\n\nchemical reactions occur in it to keep the cell in the ‘living state’.\n\nBesides the nucleus, the eukaryotic cells have other membrane bound\n\ndistinct structures called organelles like the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),\n\nthe golgi complex, lysosomes, mitochondria, microbodies and vacuoles.\n\nThe prokaryotic cells lack such membrane bound organelles.\n\nRibosomes are non-membrane bound organelles found in all cells –\n\nboth eukaryotic as well as prokaryotic. Within the cell, ribosomes are\n\nfound not only in the cytoplasm but also within the two organelles –\n\nchloroplasts (in plants) and mitochondria and on rough ER.\n\nAnimal cells contain another non-membrane bound organelle called\n\ncentrosome which helps in cell division.\n\nCells differ greatly in size, shape and activities (Figure 8.1). For example,\n\nMycoplasmas, the smallest cells, are only 0.3 µm in length while bacteria\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nCELL: THE UNIT OF LIFE 127\n\nRed blood cells\n(round and biconcave)\n\nWhite blood cells\n\n(Branched and long)\n\nColumnar epithelial cells\n(long and narrow)(amoeboid)\n\nNerve cell\n\nMesophyll cells\n(round and oval)\n\nA tracheid\n(elongated)\n\nFigure 8.1 Diagram showing different shapes of the cells\n\ncould be 3 to 5 µm. The largest isolated single cell is the egg of an ostrich.\n\nAmong multicellular organisms, human red blood cells are about 7.0\n\nµm in diameter. Nerve cells are some of the longest cells. Cells also vary\n\ngreatly in their shape. They may be disc-like, polygonal, columnar, cuboid,\n\nthread like, or even irregular. The shape of the cell may vary with the\n\nfunction they perform.\n\n8.4 PROKARYOTIC CELLS\n\nThe prokaryotic cells are represented by bacteria, blue-green algae,\n\nmycoplasma and PPLO (Pleuro Pneumonia Like Organisms). They are\n\ngenerally smaller and multiply more rapidly than the eukaryotic cells\n\n(Figure 8.2). They may vary greatly in shape and size. The four basic\n\nshapes of bacteria are bacillus (rod like), coccus (spherical), vibrio (comma\n\nshaped) and spirillum (spiral).\n\nThe organisation of the prokaryotic cell is fundamentally similar even\n\nthough prokaryotes exhibit a wide variety of shapes and functions. All\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n128 BIOLOGY\n\nprokaryotes have a cell wall surrounding the\n\ncell membrane except in mycoplasma. The fluid\n\nmatrix filling the cell is the cytoplasm. There is\n\nno well-defined nucleus. The genetic material is\n\nbasically naked, not enveloped by a nuclear\n\nmembrane. In addition to the genomic DNA (the\n\nsingle chromosome/circular DNA), many\n\nbacteria have small circular DNA outside the\n\ngenomic DNA. These smaller DNA are called\n\nplasmids. The plasmid DNA confers certain\n\nunique phenotypic characters to such bacteria.\n\nOne such character is resistance to antibiotics.\n\nIn higher classes you will learn that this plasmid\n\nDNA is used to monitor bacterial transformation\n\nwith foreign DNA. Nuclear membrane is found\n\nin eukaryotes. No organelles, like the ones in\n\neukaryotes, are found in prokaryotic cells except\n\nfor ribosomes. Prokaryotes have something\n\nunique in the form of inclusions. A specialised\n\ndifferentiated form of cell membrane called mesosome is the characteristic\n\nof prokaryotes. They are essentially infoldings of cell membrane.\n\n8.4.1 Cell Envelope and its Modifications\n\nMost prokaryotic cells, particularly the bacterial cells, have a chemically\n\ncomplex cell envelope. The cell envelope consists of a tightly bound three\n\nlayered structure i.e., the outermost glycocalyx followed by the cell wall and\n\nthen the plasma membrane. Although each layer of the envelope performs\n\ndistinct function, they act together as a single protective unit. Bacteria can\n\nbe classified into two groups on the basis of the differences in the cell envelopes\n\nand the manner in which they respond to the staining procedure developed\n\nby Gram viz., those that take up the gram stain are Gram positive and the\n\nothers that do not are called Gram negative bacteria.\n\nGlycocalyx differs in composition and thickness among different\n\nbacteria. It could be a loose sheath called the slime layer in some, while\n\nin others it may be thick and tough, called the capsule. The cell wall\n\ndetermines the shape of the cell and provides a strong structural support\n\nto prevent the bacterium from bursting or collapsing.\n\nThe plasma membrane is selectively permeable in nature and interacts\n\nwith the outside world. This membrane is similar structurally to that of\n\nthe eukaryotes.\n\nA special membranous structure is the mesosome which is formed\n\nby the extensions of plasma membrane into the cell. These extensions are\n\nin the form of vesicles, tubules and lamellae. They help in cell wall\n\nTypical bacteria\n(1-2 m)m\n\nPPLO\n(about 0.1 m)m\n\nViruses\n(0.02-0.2 m)m\n\nA typical eukaryotic cell\n(10-20 m)m\n\nFigure 8.2 Diagram showing comparison of\neukaryotic cell with other\norganisms\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nCELL: THE UNIT OF LIFE 129\n\nformation, DNA replication and distribution to daughter cells. They also\n\nhelp in respiration, secretion processes, to increase the surface area of\n\nthe plasma membrane and enzymatic content. In some prokaryotes like\n\ncyanobacteria, there are other membranous extensions into the cytoplasm\n\ncalled chromatophores which contain pigments.\n\nBacterial cells may be motile or non-motile. If motile, they have thin\n\nfilamentous extensions from their cell wall called flagella. Bacteria show a\n\nrange in the number and arrangement of flagella. Bacterial flagellum is\n\ncomposed of three parts – filament, hook and basal body. The filament\n\nis the longest portion and extends from the cell surface to the outside.\n\nBesides flagella, Pili and Fimbriae are also surface structures of the\n\nbacteria but do not play a role in motility. The pili are elongated tubular\n\nstructures made of a special protein. The fimbriae are small bristle like\n\nfibres sprouting out of the cell. In some bacteria, they are known to help\n\nattach the bacteria  to rocks in streams and also to the host tissues.\n\n8.4.2 Ribosomes and Inclusion Bodies\n\nIn prokaryotes, ribosomes are associated with the plasma membrane of\n\nthe cell. They are about 15 nm by 20 nm in size and are made of two\n\nsubunits - 50S and 30S units which when present together form 70S\n\nprokaryotic ribosomes. Ribosomes are the site of protein synthesis. Several\n\nribosomes may attach to a single mRNA and form a chain called\n\npolyribosomes or polysome. The ribosomes of a polysome translate the\n\nmRNA into proteins.\n\nInclusion bodies: Reserve material in prokaryotic cells are stored in\n\nthe cytoplasm in the form of inclusion bodies. These are not bound by\n\nany membrane system and lie free in the cytoplasm, e.g., phosphate\n\ngranules, cyanophycean granules and glycogen granules. Gas vacuoles\n\nare found in blue green and purple and green photosynthetic bacteria.\n\n8.5 EUKARYOTIC CELLS\n\nThe eukaryotes include all the protists, plants, animals and fungi. In\n\neukaryotic cells there is an extensive compartmentalisation of cytoplasm\n\nthrough the presence of membrane bound organelles. Eukaryotic cells\n\npossess an organised nucleus with a nuclear envelope. In addition,\n\neukaryotic cells have a variety of complex locomotory and cytoskeletal\n\nstructures. Their genetic material is organised into chromosomes.\n\nAll eukaryotic cells are not identical. Plant and animal cells are different\n\nas the former possess cell walls, plastids and a large central vacuole which\n\nare absent in animal cells. On the other hand, animal cells have centrioles\n\nwhich are absent in almost all plant cells (Figure 8.3).\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n130 BIOLOGY\n\nRough endoplasmic\nreticulum\n\nLysosome\nSmooth\n\nendoplasmic\nreticulum\n\nPlasmodesmata\n\nMicrotubule\n\nNucleus\n\nNucleolus\n\nGolgi\napparatus\n\nNuclear\nenvelope\n\nVacuole\n\nMiddle lamella\n\nPlasma\nmembrane\n\nCell wall\n\nMitochondrion\n\nRibosomesChloroplast\nCytoplasm\n\nPeroxisome\n\nFigure 8.3 Diagram showing : (a) Plant cell  (b) Animal cell\n\nGolgi\napparatus\n\nSmooth\nendoplasmic\n\nreticulum\n\nNuclear\n\nenvelope\n\nNucleolus\n\nNucleus\n\nMicrovilli\n\nPlasma\nmembrane\n\nCentriole\n\nPeroxiome\n\nLysosome\n\nRibosomes\n\nMitochondrion\n\nRough\nendoplasmic\n\nreticulum\n\nCytoplasm\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nCELL: THE UNIT OF LIFE 131\n\nCholesterol\n\nSugar Peripheral\n Protein\n\nPhospholipid\nbilayer\n\nLet us now look at individual cell organelles to understand their\n\nstructure and functions.\n\n8.5.1 Cell Membrane\n\nThe detailed structure of the membrane was studied only after the advent\n\nof the electron microscope in the 1950s. Meanwhile, chemical studies on\n\nthe cell membrane, especially in human red blood cells (RBCs), enabled\n\nthe scientists to deduce the possible structure of plasma membrane.\n\nThese studies showed that the cell membrane is mainly composed of\n\nlipids and proteins. The major lipids are phospholipids that are arranged\n\nin a bilayer. Also, the lipids are arranged within the membrane with the\n\npolar head towards the outer sides and the hydrophobic tails towards\n\nthe inner part.This ensures that the nonpolar tail of saturated\n\nhydrocarbons is protected from the aqueous environment (Figure 8.4).\n\nIn addition to phospholipids membrane also contains cholesterol.\n\nLater, biochemical investigation clearly revealed that the cell membranes\n\nalso possess protein and carbohydrate. The ratio of protein and lipid varies\n\nconsiderably in different cell types. In human beings, the  membrane of the\n\nerythrocyte has approximately 52 per cent protein and 40 per cent lipids.\n\nDepending on the ease of extraction, membrane proteins can be\n\nclassified as integral and peripheral. Peripheral proteins lie on the surface\n\nof membrane while the integral proteins are partially or totally buried in\n\nthe membrane.\n\nFigure 8.4 Fluid mosaic model of plasma membrane\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n132 BIOLOGY\n\nAn improved model of  the structure of cell membrane was proposed\n\nby Singer and Nicolson (1972) widely accepted as fluid mosaic model\n\n(Figure 8.4). According to this, the quasi-fluid nature of lipid enables\n\nlateral movement of proteins within the overall bilayer. This ability to move\n\nwithin the membrane is measured as its fluidity.\n\nThe fluid nature of the membrane is also important from the point of\n\nview of functions like cell growth, formation of intercellular junctions,\n\nsecretion, endocytosis, cell division etc.\n\nOne of the most important functions of the plasma membrane is the\n\ntransport of the molecules across it. The membrane is selectively permeable\n\nto some molecules present on either side of it. Many molecules can move\n\nbriefly across the membrane without any requirement of energy and this\n\nis called the passive transport. Neutral solutes may move across the\n\nmembrane by the process of simple diffusion along the concentration\n\ngradient, i.e., from higher concentration to the lower. Water may also move\n\nacross this membrane from higher to lower concentration. Movement of\n\nwater by diffusion is called osmosis. As the polar molecules cannot pass\n\nthrough the nonpolar lipid bilayer, they require a carrier protein of the\n\nmembrane to facilitate their transport across the membrane. A few ions\n\nor molecules are transported across the membrane against their\n\nconcentration gradient, i.e., from lower to the higher concentration. Such\n\na transport is an energy dependent process, in which ATP is utilised and\n\nis called active transport, e.g., Na+/K+ Pump.\n\n8.5.2 Cell Wall\n\nAs you may recall, a non-living rigid structure called the cell wall forms\n\nan outer covering for the plasma membrane of fungi and plants. Cell wall\n\nnot only gives shape to the cell and protects the cell from mechanical\n\ndamage and infection, it also helps in cell-to-cell interaction and provides\n\nbarrier to undesirable macromolecules. Algae have cell wall, made of\n\ncellulose, galactans, mannans and minerals like calcium carbonate, while\n\nin other plants it consists of cellulose, hemicellulose, pectins and proteins.\n\nThe cell wall of a young plant cell, the primary wall is capable of growth,\n\nwhich gradually diminishes as the cell matures and the secondary wall is\n\nformed on the inner (towards membrane) side of the cell.\n\nThe middle lamella is a layer mainly of calcium pectate which holds\n\nor glues the different neighbouring cells together. The cell wall and middle\n\nlamellae may be traversed by plasmodesmata which connect the cytoplasm\n\nof neighbouring cells.\n\n8.5.3 Endomembrane System\n\nWhile each of the membranous organelles is distinct in terms of its\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nCELL: THE UNIT OF LIFE 133\n\nNucleus\n\nNuclear pore Rough\n\nRibosome\n\nendoplasmic\n\nEndoplasmic\n\nreticulum\n\nSmooth\n\nreticulum\n\nstructure and function, many of these are\n\nconsidered together as an endomembrane system\n\nbecause their functions are coordinated. The\n\nendomembrane system include endoplasmic\n\nreticulum (ER), golgi complex, lysosomes and\n\nvacuoles. Since the functions of the mitochondria,\n\nchloroplast and peroxisomes are not coordinated\n\nwith the above components, these are not\n\nconsidered as part of the endomembrane system.\n\n8.5.3.1 The Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)\n\nElectron microscopic studies of eukaryotic cells\n\nreveal the presence of a network or reticulum of\n\ntiny tubular structures scattered in the cytoplasm\n\nthat is called the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)\n\n(Figure 8.5).  Hence, ER divides the intracellular\n\nspace into two distinct compartments, i.e., luminal\n\n(inside ER) and extra luminal (cytoplasm)\n\ncompartments.\n\nThe ER often shows ribosomes attached to\n\ntheir outer surface. The endoplasmic reticulun\n\nbearing ribosomes on their surface is called rough\n\nendoplasmic reticulum (RER). In the absence of\n\nribosomes they appear smooth and are called\n\nsmooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER).\n\nRER is frequently observed in the cells actively\n\ninvolved in protein synthesis and secretion. They\n\nare extensive and continuous with the outer\n\nmembrane of the nucleus.\n\nThe smooth endoplasmic reticulum is the major\n\nsite for synthesis of lipid. In animal cells lipid-like\n\nsteroidal hormones are synthesised in SER.\n\n8.5.3.2 Golgi apparatus\n\nCamillo Golgi (1898) first observed densely stained\n\nreticular structures near the nucleus. These were\n\nlater named Golgi bodies after him. They consist\n\nof many flat, disc-shaped sacs or cisternae of\n\n0.5µm to 1.0µm diameter (Figure 8.6). These are\n\nstacked parallel to each other. Varied number of\n\ncisternae are present in a Golgi complex. The Golgi\n\ncisternae are concentrically arranged near the\n\nnucleus with distinct convex cis or the forming\n\nFigure 8.5 Endoplasmic reticulum\n\nCisternae\n\nFigure 8.6  Golgi apparatus\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n134 BIOLOGY\n\nface and concave  trans or the maturing face.\n\nThe cis and the trans faces of the organelle are entirely different, but\n\ninterconnected.\n\nThe golgi apparatus principally performs the function of packaging\n\nmaterials, to be delivered either to the intra-cellular targets or secreted\n\noutside the cell. Materials to be packaged in the form of vesicles from\n\nthe ER fuse with the cis face of the golgi apparatus and move towards\n\nthe maturing face. This explains, why the golgi apparatus remains in\n\nclose association with the endoplasmic reticulum. A number of proteins\n\nsynthesised by ribosomes on the endoplasmic reticulum are modified\n\nin the cisternae of the golgi apparatus before they are released from its\n\ntrans face. Golgi apparatus is the important site of formation of\n\nglycoproteins and glycolipids.\n\n8.5.3.3 Lysosomes\n\nThese are membrane bound vesicular structures formed by the process\n\nof packaging in the golgi apparatus. The isolated lysosomal vesicles\n\nhave been found to be very rich in almost all types of hydrolytic\n\nenzymes (hydrolases – lipases, proteases, carbohydrases) optimally\n\nactive at the acidic pH. These enzymes are capable of digesting\n\ncarbohydrates, proteins, lipids and nucleic acids.\n\n8.5.3.4 Vacuoles\n\nThe vacuole is the membrane-bound space found in the cytoplasm. It contains\n\nwater, sap, excretory product and other materials not useful for the cell. The\n\nvacuole is bound by a single membrane called tonoplast. In plant cells the\n\nvacuoles can occupy up to 90 per cent of the volume of the cell.\n\nIn plants, the tonoplast facilitates the transport of a number of ions\n\nand other materials against concentration gradients into the vacuole, hence\n\ntheir concentration is significantly higher in the vacuole than in the\n\ncytoplasm.\n\nIn Amoeba the contractile vacuole is important for osmoregulation\n\nand excretion. In many cells, as in protists, food vacuoles are formed by\n\nengulfing the food particles.\n\n8.5.4 Mitochondria\n\nMitochondria (sing.: mitochondrion), unless specifically stained, are not\n\neasily visible under the microscope. The number of mitochondria per cell\n\nis variable depending on the physiological activity of the cells. In terms of\n\nshape and size also, considerable degree of variability is observed. Typically\n\nit is sausage-shaped or cylindrical having a diameter of 0.2-1.0µm (average\n\n0.5µm) and length 1.0-4.1µm. Each mitochondrion is a double\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nCELL: THE UNIT OF LIFE 135\n\nmembrane-bound structure with the outer membrane and the inner\n\nmembrane dividing its lumen distinctly into two aqueous compartments,\n\ni.e., the outer compartment and the inner compartment. The inner\n\ncompartment is filled with a dense homogeneous substance called the\n\nmatrix. The outer membrane forms the continuous limiting boundary of\n\nthe organelle. The inner membrane forms a number of infoldings called\n\nthe cristae (sing.: crista) towards the matrix (Figure 8.7). The cristae\n\nincrease the surface area. The two membranes have their own specific\n\nenzymes associated with the mitochondrial function. Mitochondria are\n\nthe sites of aerobic respiration. They produce cellular energy in the form\n\nof ATP, hence they are called ‘power houses’ of the cell. The matrix also\n\npossesses single circular DNA molecule, a few RNA molecules, ribosomes\n\n(70S) and the components required for the synthesis of proteins. The\n\nmitochondria divide by fission.\n\n8.5.5 Plastids\n\nPlastids are found in all plant cells and in euglenoides. These are easily\n\nobserved under the microscope as they are large. They bear some specific\n\npigments, thus imparting specific colours to the plants. Based on the\n\ntype of pigments plastids can be classified into chloroplasts,\n\nchromoplasts and leucoplasts.\n\nThe chloroplasts contain chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments which\n\nare responsible for trapping light energy essential for photosynthesis. In\n\nthe chromoplasts fat soluble carotenoid pigments like carotene,\n\nxanthophylls and others are present. This gives the part of the plant a\n\nyellow, orange or red colour. The leucoplasts are the colourless plastids\n\nof varied shapes and sizes with stored nutrients: Amyloplasts store\n\ncarbohydrates (starch), e.g., potato; elaioplasts store oils and fats whereas\n\nOuter\nmembrane\n\nInner\nmembrane\n\nMatrix Crista\n\nFigure 8.7  Structure of mitochondrion (Longitudinal section)\n\nInter-membrane\nspace\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n136 BIOLOGY\n\nthe aleuroplasts store proteins.\n\nMajority of the chloroplasts of the green\n\nplants are found in the mesophyll cells of\n\nthe leaves. These are lens-shaped, oval,\n\nspherical, discoid or even ribbon-like\n\norganelles having variable length (5-10µm)\n\nand width (2-4µm). Their number varies\n\nfrom 1 per cell of the Chlamydomonas, a\n\ngreen alga to 20-40 per cell in the mesophyll.\n\nLike mitochondria, the chloroplasts are\n\nalso double membrane bound. Of the two,\n\nthe  inner chloroplast membrane is relatively\n\nless permeable. The space limited by the\n\ninner membrane of the chloroplast is called the stroma. A number of organised\n\nflattened membranous sacs called the thylakoids, are present in the stroma\n\n(Figure 8.8). Thylakoids are arranged in stacks  like the piles of coins called\n\ngrana (singular: granum) or the intergranal thylakoids. In addition, there are\n\nflat membranous tubules called the stroma lamellae connecting the thylakoids\n\nof the different grana. The membrane of the thylakoids enclose a space called\n\na lumen. The stroma of the chloroplast contains enzymes required for the\n\nsynthesis of carbohydrates and proteins. It also contains small, double-\n\nstranded circular DNA molecules and ribosomes. Chlorophyll pigments are\n\npresent in the thylakoids. The ribosomes of the chloroplasts are smaller (70S)\n\nthan the cytoplasmic ribosomes (80S).\n\n8.5.6 Ribosomes\n\nRibosomes are the granular structures first observed under the electron\n\nmicroscope as dense particles by George Palade (1953). They are\n\ncomposed of ribonucleic acid (RNA) and proteins and\n\nare not surrounded by any membrane.\n\nThe eukaryotic ribosomes are 80S while the\nprokaryotic ribosomes are 70S. Each ribosome has two\nsubunits, larger and smaller subunits (Fig 8.9). The two\nsubunits of 80S ribosomes are 60S and 40S while that\nof 70S ribosomes are 50S and 30S. Here ‘S’ (Svedberg’s\nUnit) stands for the sedimentation coefficient; it is\nindirectly a measure of density and size. Both 70S and\n80S ribosomes are composed of two subunits.\n\nFigure 8.8  Sectional view of chloroplast\n\nFigure 8.9 Ribosome\n\n8.5.7 Cytoskeleton\n\nAn elaborate network of filamentous proteinaceous structures consisting\nof microtubules, microfilaments and intermediate filaments present in\nthe cytoplasm is collectively referred to as the cytoskeleton. The\ncytoskeleton  in a cell are involved in many functions such as mechanical\nsupport, motility, maintenance of the shape of the cell.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nCELL: THE UNIT OF LIFE 137\n\n8.5.8 Cilia and Flagella\n\nCilia (sing.: cilium) and flagella (sing.: flagellum) are hair-like outgrowths\n\nof the cell membrane.  Cilia are small structures which work like oars,\n\ncausing the movement of either the cell or the surrounding fluid. Flagella\n\nare comparatively longer and responsible for cell movement. The\n\nprokaryotic bacteria also possess flagella but these are structurally\n\ndifferent from that of the eukaryotic flagella.\n\nThe electron microscopic study of a cilium or the flagellum show that\n\nthey are covered with plasma membrane. Their core called the axoneme,\n\npossesses a number of microtubules running parallel to the long axis.\n\nThe axoneme usually has nine doublets of radially arranged peripheral\n\nmicrotubules, and a pair of centrally located microtubules. Such an\n\narrangement of axonemal microtubules is referred to as the 9+2 array\n\n(Figure 8.10). The central tubules are connected by bridges and is also\n\nenclosed by a central sheath, which is connected to one of the tubules of\n\neach peripheral doublets by a radial spoke. Thus, there are nine radial\n\nspokes. The peripheral doublets are also interconnected by linkers. Both\n\nthe cilium and flagellum emerge from centriole-like structure called the\n\nbasal bodies.\n\n8.5.9 Centrosome and Centrioles\n\nCentrosome is an organelle usually containing two cylindrical structures\n\ncalled centrioles. They are surrounded by amorphous pericentriolar\n\nmaterials. Both the centrioles in a centrosome lie perpendicular to each\n\nother in which each has an organisation like the cartwheel. They are\n\nPlasma\nmembrane\n\nPeripheral\nmicrotubules\n(doublets)\n\nInterdoublet\nbridge\n\nCentral\nmicrotubleRadial\n\nspoke\n\nCentral\nsheath\n\nFigure 8.10 Section of cilia/flagella showing different parts : (a) Electron micrograph\n(b) Diagrammatic representation of internal structure\n\n(a) (b)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n138 BIOLOGY\n\nmade up of nine evenly spaced peripheral fibrils of tubulin protein. Each\n\nof the peripheral fibril is a triplet.The adjacent triplets are also linked.\n\nThe central part of the proximal region of the centriole is also proteinaceous\n\nand called the hub, which is connected with tubules of the peripheral\n\ntriplets by radial spokes made of protein. The centrioles form the basal\n\nbody of cilia or flagella, and spindle fibres that give rise to spindle\n\napparatus during cell division in animal cells.\n\n8.5.10 Nucleus\n\nNucleus as a cell organelle was first described by Robert Brown as early\n\nas 1831. Later the material of the nucleus stained by the basic dyes was\n\ngiven the name chromatin by Flemming.\n\nThe interphase nucleus (nucleus of a\n\ncell when it is not dividing) has highly\n\nextended and elaborate nucleoprotein\n\nfibres called chromatin, nuclear matrix\n\nand one or more spherical bodies called\n\nnucleoli (sing.: nucleolus) (Figure 8.11).\n\nElectron microscopy has revealed that the\n\nnuclear envelope, which consists of two\n\nparallel membranes with a space between\n\n(10 to 50 nm) called the perinuclear\n\nspace, forms a barrier between the\n\nmaterials present inside the nucleus and\n\nthat of the cytoplasm. The outer\n\nmembrane usually remains continuous\n\nwith the endoplasmic reticulum and also\n\nbears ribosomes on it. At a number of\n\nplaces the nuclear envelope is interrupted by minute pores, which are\n\nformed by the fusion of its two membranes. These nuclear pores are the\n\npassages through which movement of RNA and protein molecules takes\n\nplace in both directions between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Normally,\n\nthere is only one nucleus per cell, variations in the number of nuclei are\n\nalso frequently observed. Can you recollect names of organisms that\n\nhave more than one nucleus per cell? Some mature cells even lack\n\nnucleus, e.g., erythrocytes of many mammals and sieve tube cells of\n\nvascular plants. Would you consider these cells as ‘living’?\n\nThe nuclear matrix or the nucleoplasm contains nucleolus and\n\nchromatin. The nucleoli are spherical structures present in the\n\nnucleoplasm. The content of nucleolus is continuous with the rest of the\n\nnucleoplasm as it is not a membrane bound structure. It is a site for\n\nactive ribosomal RNA synthesis. Larger and more numerous nucleoli are\n\npresent in cells actively carrying out protein synthesis.\n\nNucleoplasm\n\nNucleolus\n\nNuclear pore\n\nNuclear\nmembrane\n\nFigure 8.11  Structure of nucleus\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nCELL: THE UNIT OF LIFE 139\n\nKinetochore\n\nFigure 8.12 Chromosome with\nkinetochore\n\nFigure 8.13  Types of chromosomes based on the position of centromere\n\nYou may recall that the interphase nucleus has a loose\n\nand indistinct network of nucleoprotein fibres called\n\nchromatin. But during different stages of cell division, cells\n\nshow structured chromosomes in place of the nucleus.\n\nChromatin contains DNA and some basic proteins called\n\nhistones, some non-histone proteins and also RNA. A\n\nsingle human cell has approximately two metre long\n\nthread of DNA distributed among its forty six (twenty three\n\npairs) chromosomes. You will study the details of DNA\n\npackaging in the form of a chromosome in class XII.\n\nEvery chromosome (visible only in dividing cells)\n\nessentially has a primary constriction or the centromere\n\non the sides of which disc shaped structures called\n\nkinetochores are present (Figure 8.12). Centromere holds\n\ntwo chromatids of a chromosome. Based on the position\n\nof the centromere, the chromosomes can be classified into\n\nfour types (Figure 8.13). The metacentric chromosome\n\nhas middle centromere forming two equal arms of the\n\nchromosome. The sub-metacentric chromosome has\n\ncentromere slightly away from the middle of the\n\nchromosome resulting into one shorter arm and one\n\nlonger arm. In case of acrocentric chromosome the\n\ncentromere is situated close to its end forming one\n\nextremely short and one very long arm, whereas the\n\ntelocentric chromosome has a terminal centromere.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n140 BIOLOGY\n\nSometimes a few chromosomes have non-staining secondary\n\nconstrictions at a constant location. This gives the appearance of a small\n\nfragment called the satellite.\n\n8.5.11 Microbodies\n\nMany membrane bound minute vesicles called microbodies that contain\n\nvarious enzymes, are present in both plant and animal cells.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nAll organisms are made of cells or aggregates of cells. Cells vary in their shape, size\n\nand activities/functions. Based on the presence or absence of a membrane bound\n\nnucleus and other organelles, cells and hence organisms can be named as\n\neukaryotic or prokaryotic.\n\nA typical eukaryotic cell consists of a cell membrane, nucleus and cytoplasm.\n\nPlant cells have a cell wall outside the cell membrane. The plasma membrane is\n\nselectively permeable and facilitates transport of several molecules. The\n\nendomembrane system includes ER, golgi complex, lysosomes and vacuoles. All\n\nthe cell organelles perform different but specific functions. Centrosome and centriole\n\nform the basal body of cilia and flagella that facilitate locomotion. In animal cells,\n\ncentrioles also form spindle apparatus during cell division. Nucleus contains\n\nnucleoli and chromatin network. It not only controls the activities of organelles\n\nbut also plays a major role in heredity.\n\nEndoplasmic reticulum contains tubules or cisternae. They are of two types:\n\nrough and smooth. ER helps in the transport of substances, synthesis of\n\nproteins, lipoproteins and glycogen. The golgi body is a membranous organelle\n\ncomposed of flattened sacs. The secretions of cells are packed in them and\n\ntransported from the cell. Lysosomes are single membrane structures\n\ncontaining enzymes for digestion of all types of macromolecules. Ribosomes\n\nare involved in protein synthesis. These occur freely in the cytoplasm or are\n\nassociated with ER. Mitochondria help in oxidative phosphorylation and\n\ngeneration of adenosine triphosphate. They are bound by double membrane;\n\nthe outer membrane is smooth and inner one folds into several cristae. Plastids\n\nare pigment containing organelles found in plant cells only. In plant cells,\n\nchloroplasts are responsible for trapping light energy essential for\n\nphotosynthesis. The grana, in the plastid, is the site of light reactions and the\n\nstroma of dark reactions. The green coloured plastids are chloroplasts, which\n\ncontain chlorophyll, whereas the other coloured plastids are chromoplasts,\n\nwhich may contain pigments like carotene and xanthophyll. The nucleus is\n\nenclosed by nuclear envelope, a double membrane structure with nuclear pores.\n\nThe inner membrane encloses the nucleoplasm and the chromatin material.\n\nThus, cell is the structural and functional unit of life.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nCELL: THE UNIT OF LIFE 141\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1.

Now a\nquestion that arises in our minds is: Are all living organisms made of the\nsame chemicals, i.e., elements and compounds? You have learnt in\nchemistry how elemental analysis is performed. If we perform such an\nanalysis on a plant tissue, animal tissue or a microbial paste, we obtain a\nlist of elements like carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and several others and\ntheir respective content per unit mass of a living tissue. If the same analysis\nis performed on a piece of earth’s crust as an example of non-living matter,\nwe obtain a similar list. What are the differences between the two lists? In\nabsolute terms, no such differences could be made out. All the elements\npresent in a sample of earth’s crust are also present in a sample of living\ntissue. However, a closer examination reveals that the relative abundance\nof carbon and hydrogen with respect to other elements is higher in any\nliving organism than in earth’s crust (Table 9.1).\n\n9.1 HOW TO ANALYSE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION?\n\nWe can continue asking in the same way, what type of organic compounds\nare found in living organisms? How does one go about finding the answer?\nTo get an answer, one has to perform a chemical analysis. We can take any\nliving tissue (a vegetable or a piece of liver, etc.) and grind it in trichloroacetic\nacid (Cl\n\n3\nCCOOH) using a mortar and a pestle. We obtain a thick slurry. If\n\nwe were to strain this through a cheesecloth or cotton we would obtain two\nfractions. One is called the filtrate or more technically, the acid-soluble\npool, and the second, the retentate or the acid-insoluble fraction. Scientists\nhave found thousands of organic compounds in the acid-soluble pool.\n\nBIOMOLECULES\n\nCHAPTER  9\n\n9.1 How to Analyse\n\nChemical\n\nComposition?\n\n9.2 Primary and\n\nSecondary\n\nMetabolites\n\n9.3 Biomacromolecules\n\n9.4 Proteins\n\n9.5 Polysaccharides\n\n9.6 Nucleic Acids\n\n9.7 Structure of\n\nProteins\n\n9.8 Nature of Bond\n\nLinking Monomers\n\nin a Polymer\n\n9.9 Dynamic State of\n\nBody Constituents\n\n- Concept of\n\nMetabolism\n\n9.10 Metabolic Basis for\n\nLiving\n\n9.11 The Living State\n\n9.12 Enzymes\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nBIOMOLECULES 143\n\nIn higher classes you will learn about how\nto analyse a living tissue sample and identify a\nparticular organic compound. It will suffice to\nsay here that one extracts the compounds, then\nsubjects the extract to various separation\ntechniques till one has separated a compound\nfrom all other compounds. In other words, one\nisolates and purifies a compound. Analytical\ntechniques, when applied to the compound give\nus an idea of the molecular formula and the\nprobable structure of the compound. All the\ncarbon compounds that we get from living\ntissues can be called ‘biomolecules’. However,\nliving organisms have also got inorganic\nelements and compounds in them. How do we\nknow this? A slightly different but destructive\nexperiment has to be done. One weighs a small\namount of a living tissue (say a leaf or liver and\nthis is called wet weight) and dry it. All the water,\nevaporates. The remaining material gives dry\nweight. Now if the tissue is fully burnt, all the\ncarbon compounds are oxidised to gaseous\nform (CO\n\n2\n, water vapour) and are removed. What\n\nis remaining is called ‘ash’. This ash contains\ninorganic elements (like calcium, magnesium\netc). Inorganic compounds like sulphate,\nphosphate, etc., are also seen in the acid-soluble\nfraction. Therefore elemental analysis gives\nelemental composition of living tissues in the\nform of hydrogen, oxygen, chlorine, carbon etc.\nwhile analysis for compounds gives an idea of\n\nElement % Weight of\n  Earth’s crust Human body\n\nHydrogen (H) 0.14 0.5\nCarbon  (C) 0.03 18.5\nOxygen (O) 46.6 65.0\nNitrogen (N) very little 3.3\nSulphur (S) 0.03 0.3\nSodium (Na) 2.8 0.2\nCalcium (Ca) 3.6 1.5\nMagnesium (Mg) 2.1 0.1\nSilicon (Si) 27.7 negligible\n\n* Adapted from CNR Rao, Understanding Chemistry,\nUniversities Press, Hyderabad.\n\nTABLE 9.1 A Comparison of Elements Present\nin Non-living and Living Matter*\n\nComponent Formula\n\nSodium Na+\n\nPotassium K+\n\nCalcium Ca++\n\nMagnesium Mg++\n\nWater H\n2\nO\n\nCompounds NaCl, CaCO\n3\n,\n\nPO SO4\n3\n\n4\n2− −,\n\nTABLE 9.2 A List of Representative Inorganic\nConstituents of Living Tissues\n\nthe kind of organic (Figure 9.1) and inorganic constituents (Table 9.2)\npresent in living tissues. From a chemistry point of view, one can identify\nfunctional groups like aldehydes, ketones, aromatic compounds, etc. But\nfrom a biological point of view, we shall classify them into amino acids,\nnucleotide bases, fatty acids etc.\n\nAmino acids are organic compounds containing an amino group and\nan acidic group as substituents on the same carbon i.e., the α-carbon.\nHence, they are called α-amino acids. They are substituted methanes. There\nare four substituent groups occupying the four valency positions. These\nare hydrogen, carboxyl group, amino group and a variable group\ndesignated as R group. Based on the nature of R group there are many\namino acids. However, those which occur in proteins are only of twenty\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n144 BIOLOGY\n\ntypes. The R group in these proteinaceous amino acids could be a hydrogen\n(the amino acid is called glycine), a methyl group (alanine), hydroxy methyl\n(serine), etc. Three of the twenty are shown in Figure 9.1.\n\nThe chemical and physical properties of amino acids are essentially\nof the amino, carboxyl and the R functional groups. Based on number of\namino and carboxyl groups, there are acidic (e.g., glutamic acid), basic\n(lysine) and neutral (valine) amino acids. Similarly, there are aromatic\namino acids (tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan). A particular property\nof amino acids is the ionizable nature of –NH\n\n2\n and –COOH groups. Hence\n\nin solutions of different pH, the structure of amino acids changes.\n\nB is called zwitterionic form.\n\nLipids are generally water insoluble. They could be simple fatty acids.\nA fatty acid has a carboxyl group attached to an R group. The R group\ncould be a methyl (–CH\n\n3\n), or ethyl  (–C\n\n2\nH\n\n5\n) or higher number of –CH\n\n2\n\ngroups (1 carbon to 19 carbons). For example, palmitic acid has 16\ncarbons including carboxyl carbon. Arachidonic acid has 20 carbon\natoms including the carboxyl carbon. Fatty acids could be saturated\n(without double bond) or unsaturated (with one or more C=C double\nbonds). Another simple lipid is glycerol which is trihydroxy propane. Many\nlipids have both glycerol and fatty acids. Here the fatty acids are found\nesterified with glycerol. They can be then monoglycerides, diglycerides\nand triglycerides. These are also called fats and oils based on melting\npoint. Oils have lower melting point (e.g., gingelly oil) and hence remain\nas oil in winters. Can you identify a fat from the market? Some lipids\nhave phosphorous and a phosphorylated organic compound in them.\nThese are phospholipids. They are found in cell membrane. Lecithin is\none example. Some tissues especially the neural tissues have lipids with\nmore complex structures.\n\nLiving organisms have a number of carbon compounds in which\nheterocyclic rings can be found. Some of these are nitrogen bases –\nadenine, guanine, cytosine, uracil, and thymine. When found attached to\na sugar, they are called nucleosides. If a phosphate group is also found\nesterified to the sugar they are called nucleotides. Adenosine, guanosine,\nthymidine, uridine and  cytidine are nucleosides. Adenylic acid, thymidylic\nacid, guanylic acid, uridylic acid and cytidylic acid are nucleotides. Nucleic\nacids like DNA and RNA consist of nucleotides only.

In animal tissues, one notices the presence of all such\ncategories of compounds shown in Figure 9.1. These are called primary\nmetabolites. However, when one analyses plant, fungal and microbial cells,\none would see thousands of compounds other than these called primary\nmetabolites, e.g. alkaloids, flavonoids, rubber, essential oils, antibiotics,\n\ncoloured pigments, scents, gums, spices. These\nare called secondary metabolites (Table 9.3).\nWhile primary metabolites have identifiable\nfunctions and play known roles in normal\nphysiologial processes, we do not at the moment,\nunderstand the role or functions of all the\n‘secondary metabolites’ in host organisms.\nHowever, many of them are useful to ‘human\nwelfare’ (e.g., rubber, drugs, spices, scents and\npigments). Some secondary metabolites have\necological importance. In the later chapters and\nyears you will learn more about this.\n\n9.3 BIOMACROMOLECULES\n\nThere is one feature common to all those compounds found in the acid\nsoluble pool. They have molecular weights ranging from 18 to around\n800 daltons (Da) approximately.\n\nThe acid insoluble fraction, has only four types of organic compounds\ni.e., proteins, nucleic acids, polysaccharides and lipids. These classes of\ncompounds with the exception of lipids, have molecular weights in the\nrange of ten thousand daltons and above. For this very reason,\nbiomolecules, i.e., chemical compounds found in living organisms are of\ntwo types. One, those which have molecular weights less than one\nthousand dalton and are usually referred to as micromolecules or simply\nbiomolecules while those which are found in the acid insoluble fraction\nare called macromolecules or biomacromolecules.\n\nThe molecules in the insoluble fraction with the exception of lipids\nare polymeric substances. Then why do lipids, whose molecular weights\ndo not exceed 800 Da, come under acid insoluble fraction, i.e.,\nmacromolecular fraction? Lipids are indeed small molecular weight\n\nPigments Carotenoids, Anthocyanins,\netc.\n\nAlkaloids Morphine, Codeine, etc.\n\nTerpenoides Monoterpenes, Diterpenes etc.\n\nEssential oils Lemon grass oil, etc.\n\nToxins Abrin, Ricin\n\nLectins Concanavalin A\n\nDrugs Vinblastin, curcumin, etc.\n\nPolymeric Rubber, gums, cellulose\nsubstances\n\nTABLE 9.3  Some Secondary Metabolites\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nBIOMOLECULES 147\n\nComponent % of the total\ncellular mass\n\nWater 70-90\n\nProteins 10-15\n\nCarbohydrates 3\n\nLipids 2\n\nNucleic acids 5-7\n\nIons 1\n\nTABLE 9.4  Average Composition of Cells\n\ncompounds and are present not only as such but also\narranged into structures like cell membrane and other\nmembranes. When we grind a tissue, we are disrupting\nthe cell structure. Cell membrane and other\nmembranes are broken into pieces, and form vesicles\nwhich are not water soluble. Therefore, these\nmembrane fragments in the form of vesicles get\nseparated along with the acid insoluble pool and hence\nin the macromolecular fraction. Lipids are not strictly\nmacromolecules.\n\nThe acid soluble pool represents roughly the\ncytoplasmic composition. The macromolecules from\ncytoplasm and organelles become the acid insoluble\nfraction. Together they represent the entire chemical\ncomposition of living tissues or organisms.\n\nIn summary if we represent the chemical\ncomposition of living tissue from abundance point of\nview and arrange them class-wise, we observe that\nwater is the most abundant chemical in living\norganisms (Table 9.4).\n\n9.4 PROTEINS\n\nProteins are polypeptides. They are linear chains of\namino acids linked by peptide bonds as shown in\nFigure 9.3.\n\nEach protein is a polymer of amino acids. As there\nare 20 types of amino acids (e.g., alanine, cysteine,\nproline, tryptophan, lysine, etc.), a protein is a\nheteropolymer and not a homopolymer. A\nhomopolymer has only one type of monomer repeating\n‘n’ number of times. This information about the amino\nacid content is important as later in your nutrition\nlessons, you will learn that certain amino acids are\nessential for our health and they have to be supplied\nthrough our diet. Hence, dietary proteins are the\nsource of essential amino acids. Therefore, amino acids\ncan be essential or non-essential. The latter are those\nwhich our body can make, while we get essential amino\nacids through our diet/food. Proteins carry out many\nfunctions in living organisms, some transport\nnutrients across cell membrane, some fight infectious\norganisms, some are hormones, some are enzymes,\n\nTABLE 9.5 Some Proteins and their\nFunctions\n\nProtein Functions\n\nCollagen Intercellular ground\nsubstance\n\nTrypsin Enzyme\n\nInsulin Hormone\n\nAntibody Fights infectious agents\n\nReceptor Sensory reception\n(smell, taste, hormone,\netc.)\n\nGLUT-4 Enables glucose\ntransport\ninto cells\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n148 BIOLOGY\n\nCH OH2 CH OH2\n\nCH2\n\nOH\n\nOH\n\nOHOH\n\nOH\n\nO\n\nO O\n\nO\n\nO O\n\nO\n\nOOOO\n\nO\n\nO\n\nFigure 9.2 Diagrammatic representation of a portion of glycogen\n\netc. (Table 9.5). Collagen is the most abundant protein in animal world\nand Ribulose bisphosphate Carboxylase-Oxygenase (RuBisCO) is the\nmost abundant protein in the whole of the biosphere.\n\n9.5 POLYSACCHARIDES\n\nThe acid insoluble pellet also has polysaccharides (carbohydrates) as\nanother class of macromolecules. Polysaccharides are long chains of\nsugars. They are threads (literally a cotton thread) containing different\nmonosaccharides as building blocks. For example, cellulose is a\npolymeric polysaccharide consisting of only one type of monosaccharide\ni.e., glucose. Cellulose is a homopolymer. Starch is a variant of this but\npresent as a store house of energy in plant tissues. Animals have another\nvariant called glycogen. Inulin is a polymer of fructose. In a\npolysaccharide chain (say glycogen), the right end is called the reducing\nend and the left end is called the non-reducing end. It has branches as\nshown in the form of a cartoon (Figure 9.2). Starch forms helical\nsecondary structures. In fact, starch can hold I\n\n2\n molecules in the helical\n\nportion. The starch-I\n2\n is blue in colour. Cellulose does not contain\n\ncomplex helices and hence cannot hold I\n2\n.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nBIOMOLECULES 149\n\nPlant cell walls are made of cellulose. Paper made from plant pulp\nand cotton fibre is cellulosic. There are more complex polysaccharides\nin nature. They have as building blocks, amino-sugars and chemically\nmodified sugars (e.g., glucosamine, N-acetyl galactosamine, etc.).\nExoskeletons of arthropods, for example, have a complex\npolysaccharide called chitin. These complex polysaccharides are mostly\nhomopolymers.\n\n9.6 NUCLEIC ACIDS\n\nThe other type of macromolecule that one would find in the acid\ninsoluble fraction of any living tissue is the nucleic acid. These are\npolynucleotides. Together with polysaccharides and polypeptides these\ncomprise the true macromolecular fraction of any living tissue or cell.\nFor nucleic acids, the building block is a nucleotide. A nucleotide has\nthree chemically distinct components. One is a heterocyclic compound,\nthe second is a monosaccharide and the third a phosphoric acid or\nphosphate.\n\nAs you notice in Figure 9.1, the heterocyclic compounds in nucleic\nacids are the nitrogenous bases named adenine, guanine, uracil,\ncytosine, and thymine. Adenine and Guanine are substituted purines\nwhile the rest are substituted pyrimidines. The skeletal heterocyclic ring\nis called as purine and pyrimidine respectively. The sugar found in\npolynucleotides is either ribose (a monosaccharide pentose) or 2’\ndeoxyribose. A nucleic acid containing deoxyribose is called\ndeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) while that which contains ribose is called\nribonucleic acid (RNA).\n\n9.7 STRUCTURE OF PROTEINS\n\nProteins, as mentioned earlier, are heteropolymers containing strings\nof amino acids. Structure of molecules means different things in\ndifferent contexts. In inorganic chemistry, the structure invariably\nrefers to the molecular formulae (e.g., NaCl, MgCl\n\n2\n, etc.). Organic\n\nchemists always write a two dimensional view of the molecules while\nrepresenting the structure of the molecules (e.g., benzene,\nnaphthalene, etc.). Physicists conjure up the three dimensional views\nof molecular structures while biologists describe the protein structure\nat four levels. The sequence of amino acids i.e., the positional\ninformation in a protein – which is the first amino acid, which is\nsecond, and so on – is called the primary structure (Figure 9.3a) of a\nprotein. A protein is imagined as a line, the left end represented by\nthe first amino acid and the right end represented by the last amino\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n150 BIOLOGY\n\nacid. The first amino acid is also\ncalled as N-terminal amino acid. The\nlast amino acid is called the C-\nterminal amino acid. A protein\nthread does not exist throughout as\nan extended rigid rod. The thread is\nfolded in the form of a helix (similar\nto a revolving staircase). Of course,\nonly some portions of the protein\nthread are arranged in the form of a\nhelix. In proteins, only right handed\nhelices are observed. Other regions\nof the protein thread are folded into\nother forms in what is called the\nsecondary structure (Fig. 9.4 b). In\naddition, the long protein chain is\nalso folded upon itself like a hollow\nwoolen ball, giving rise to the\ntertiary structure (Figure 9.4 c).\nThis gives us a 3-dimensional view\nof a protein. Tertiary structure is\nabsolutely necessary for the many\nbiological activities of proteins.\n\nSome proteins are an assembly\nof more than one polypeptide or\nsubunits. The manner in which\nthese individual folded polypeptides\nor subunits are arranged with\nrespect to each other (e.g. linear\nstring of spheres, spheres arranged\none upon each other in the form of\na cube or  plate etc . )  is  the\narchitecture of a protein otherwise\ncalled the quaternary structure of\na protein (Fig. 9.4 d). Adult human\nhaemoglobin consists of 4 subunits.\nTwo of these are identical to each\nother. Hence, two subunits of α type\nand two subunits of β type together\nconstitute the human haemoglobin\n(Hb).\n\n(a) (b)\n\nN\n\nC\n\nFigure 9.4 Cartoon showing : (a) A secondary structure\nand  (b) A tertiary structure of proteins\n\nFigure 9.3 Various levels of Protein Structure\n\n(a) Primary\n\n(b) Secondary\n\n(d)     Quaternary\n\nHydrogen\nDisulphide bond\n\nBeta–plated sheet\n\nPolypeptide\n\nTertiary\n\nAlpha– Helix\n\n(c)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nBIOMOLECULES 151\n\n9.8   NATURE OF BOND LINKING MONOMERS IN A POLYMER\n\nIn a polypeptide or a protein, amino acids are linked by a peptide\nbond which is formed when the carboxyl (-COOH) group of one amino\nacid reacts with the amino (-NH\n\n2\n) group of the next amino acid with\n\nthe elimination of a water moiety (the process is called dehydration).\nIn a polysaccharide the individual monosaccharides are linked by a\nglycosidic bond. This bond is also formed by dehydration. This bond\nis formed between two carbon atoms of two adjacent monosaccharides.\nIn a nucleic acid a phosphate moiety links the 3’-carbon of one sugar\nof one nucleotide to the 5’-carbon of the sugar of the succeeding\nnucleotide. The bond between the phosphate and hydroxyl group of\nsugar is an ester bond. As there is one such ester bond on either side,\nit is called phosphodiester bond (Figure 9.5).\n\nNucleic acids exhibit a wide variety of secondary structures. For\nexample, one of the secondary structures exhibited by DNA is the\nfamous Watson-Crick model. This model says that DNA exists as a\ndouble helix. The two strands of polynucleotides are antiparallel i.e.,\nrun in the opposite direction. The backbone is formed by the sugar-\nphosphate-sugar chain. The nitrogen bases are projected more or less\nperpendicular to this backbone but face inside. A and G of one strand\ncompulsorily base pairs with T and C, respectively, on the other strand.\n\nFigure 9.5  Diagram indicating secondary structure of DNA\n\n5' 3'\n\n3'5'\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n152 BIOLOGY\n\nThere are two hydrogen bonds between A and T and three hydrogen\nbonds between G and C. Each strand appears like a helical  staircase.\nEach step of ascent is represented by a pair of bases. At each step of\nascent, the strand turns 36°. One full turn of the helical strand would\ninvolve ten steps or ten base pairs. Attempt drawing a line diagram.\nThe pitch would be 34Å. The rise per base pair would be 3.4Å. This\nform of DNA with the above mentioned salient features is called B-\nDNA. In higher classes, you will be told that there are more than a\ndozen forms of DNA named after English alphabets with unique\nstructural features.\n\n9.9 DYNAMIC STATE OF BODY CONSTITUENTS – CONCEPT OF\nMETABOLISM\n\nWhat we have learnt till now is that living organisms, be it a simple bacterial\ncell, a protozoan, a plant or an animal, contain thousands of organic\ncompounds. These compounds or biomolecules are present in certain\nconcentrations (expressed as mols/cell or mols/litre etc.). One of the greatest\ndiscoveries ever made was the observation that all these biomolecules have\na turn over. This means that they are constantly being changed into some\nother biomolecules and also made from some other biomolecules. This\nbreaking and making is through chemical reactions constantly occuring\nin living organisms. Together all these chemical reactions are called\nmetabolism. Each of the metabolic reactions results in the transformation\nof biomolecules. A few examples for such metabolic transformations are:\nremoval of CO\n\n2\n from amino acids making an amino acid into an amine,\n\nremoval of amino group in a nucleotide base; hydrolysis of a glycosidic\nbond in a disaccharide, etc. We can list tens and thousands of such\nexamples. Majority of these metabolic reactions do not occur in isolation\nbut are always linked to some other reactions. In other words, metabolites\nare converted into each other in a series of linked reactions called metabolic\npathways. These metabolic pathways are similar to the automobile traffic\nin a city. These pathways are either linear or circular. These pathways criss-\ncross each other, i.e., there are traffic junctions. Flow of metabolites through\nmetabolic pathway has a definite rate and direction like automobile traffic.\nThis metabolite flow is called the dynamic state of body constituents. What\nis most important is that this interlinked metabolic traffic is very smooth\nand without a single reported mishap for healthy conditions. Another feature\nof these metabolic reactions is that every chemical reaction is a catalysed\nreaction. There is no uncatalysed metabolic conversion in living systems.\nEven CO\n\n2\n dissolving in water, a physical process, is a catalysed reaction in\n\nliving systems. The catalysts which hasten the rate of a given metabolic\nconversation are also proteins. These proteins with catalytic power are\nnamed enzymes.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nBIOMOLECULES 153\n\n9.10 METABOLIC BASIS FOR LIVING\n\nMetabolic pathways can lead to a more complex structure from a simpler\nstructure (for example, acetic acid becomes cholesterol) or lead to a simpler\nstructure from a complex structure (for example, glucose becomes lactic\nacid in our skeletal muscle). The former cases are called biosynthetic\npathways or anabolic pathways. The latter constitute degradation and\nhence are called catabolic pathways. Anabolic pathways, as expected,\nconsume energy. Assembly of a protein from amino acids requires energy\ninput. On the other hand, catabolic pathways lead to the release of energy.\nFor example, when glucose is degraded to lactic acid in our skeletal muscle,\nenergy is liberated. This metabolic pathway from glucose to lactic acid which\noccurs in 10 metabolic steps is called glycolysis. Living organisms have\nlearnt to trap this energy liberated during degradation and store it in the\nform of chemical bonds. As and when needed, this bond energy is utilised\nfor biosynthetic, osmotic and mechanical work that we perform. The most\nimportant form of energy currency in living systems is the bond energy in\na chemical called adenosine triphosphate (ATP).\n\nHow do living organisms derive their energy? What strategies have they\nevolved? How do they store this energy and in what form? How do they\nconvert this energy into work? You will study and understand all this under\na sub-discipline called ‘Bioenergetics’ later in your higher classes.\n\n9.11 THE LIVING STATE\n\nAt this level, you must understand that the tens and thousands of\nchemical compounds in a living organism, otherwise called metabolites,\nor biomolecules, are present at concentrations characteristic of each of\nthem. For example, the blood concentration of glucose in a normal healthy\nindividual is 4.2 mmol/L– 6.1 mmol/L, while that of hormones would\nbe nanograms/mL. The most important fact of biological systems is that\nall living organisms exist in a steady-state characterised by\nconcentrations of each of these biomolecules. These biomolecules are in\na metabolic flux. Any chemical or physical process moves spontaneously\nto equilibrium. The steady state is a non-equilibrium state. One should\nremember from physics that systems at equilibrium cannot perform\nwork. As living organisms work continuously, they cannot afford to reach\nequilibrium. Hence the living state is a non-equilibrium steady-\nstate to be able to perform work; living process is a constant effort to\nprevent falling into equilibrium. This is achieved by energy input.\nMetabolism provides a mechanism for the production of energy. Hence\nthe living state and metabolism are synonymous. Without metabolism\nthere cannot be a living state.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n154 BIOLOGY\n\n9.12 ENZYMES\n\nAlmost all enzymes are proteins. There are some nucleic acids that behave\nlike enzymes. These are called ribozymes. One can depict an enzyme by a\nline diagram. An enzyme like any protein has a primary structure, i.e.,\namino acid sequence of the protein. An enzyme like any protein has the\nsecondary and the tertiary structure. When you look at a tertiary structure\n(Figure 9.4 b)  you will notice that the backbone of the protein chain folds\nupon itself, the chain criss-crosses itself and hence, many crevices or\npockets are made. One such pocket is the ‘active site’. An active site of an\nenzyme is a crevice or pocket into which the substrate fits. Thus enzymes,\nthrough their active site, catalyse reactions at a high rate. Enzyme catalysts\ndiffer from inorganic catalysts in many ways, but one major difference\nneeds mention. Inorganic catalysts work efficiently at high temperatures\nand high pressures, while enzymes get damaged at high temperatures\n(say above 40°C). However, enzymes isolated from organisms who normally\nlive under extremely high temperatures (e.g., hot vents and sulphur\nsprings), are stable and retain their catalytic power even at high\ntemperatures (upto 80°-90°C). Thermal stability is thus an important\nquality of such enzymes isolated from thermophilic organisms.\n\n9.12.1 Chemical Reactions\n\nHow do we understand these enzymes? Let us first understand a chemical\nreaction. Chemical compounds undergo two types of changes. A physical\nchange simply refers to a change in shape without breaking of bonds.\nThis is a physical process. Another physical process is a change in state\nof matter: when ice melts into water, or when water becomes a vapour.\nThese are also physical processes. However, when bonds are broken and\nnew bonds are formed during transformation, this will be called a chemical\nreaction. For example:\n\nBa(OH)2 + H2SO4 →  BaSO4 + 2H2O\n\nis an inorganic chemical reaction. Similarly, hydrolysis of starch into\nglucose is an organic chemical reaction. Rate of a physical or chemical\nprocess refers to the amount of product formed per unit time. It can be\nexpressed as:\n\nrate = \nδ\n\nδ\n\nP\n\nt\n\nRate can also be called velocity if the direction is specified. Rates of physical\nand chemical processes are influenced by temperature among other\nfactors. A general rule of thumb is that rate doubles or decreases by half\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nBIOMOLECULES 155\n\nfor every 10°C change in either direction. Catalysed reactions proceed at\nrates vastly higher than that of uncatalysed ones. When enzyme catalysed\nreactions are observed, the rate would be vastly higher than the same but\nuncatalysed reaction. For example\n\nCO2             +           H2O  \uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7→\nCarbonic anhydrase\n\n H2CO3\ncarbon dioxide water carbonic acid\n\nIn the absence of any enzyme this reaction is very slow, with about\n200 molecules of H\n\n2\nCO\n\n3\n being formed in an hour. However, by using the\n\nenzyme present within the cytoplasm called carbonic anhydrase, the\nreaction speeds dramatically with about 600,000 molecules being formed\nevery second. The enzyme has accelerated the reaction rate by about 10\nmillion times. The power of enzymes is incredible indeed!\n\nThere are thousands of types of enzymes each catalysing a unique\nchemical or metabolic reaction. A multistep chemical reaction, when each\nof the steps is catalysed by the same enzyme complex or different enzymes,\nis called a metabolic pathway. For example,\n\nGlucose → 2 Pyruvic acid\n\nC\n6\nH\n\n12\nO\n\n6\n  +  O\n\n2 \n→  2C\n\n3\nH\n\n4\n O\n\n3 \n+ 2H\n\n2\nO\n\nis actually a metabolic pathway in which glucose becomes pyruvic acid\nthrough ten different enzyme catalysed metabolic reactions. When you\nstudy respiration in Chapter 14 you will study these reactions.  At this\nstage you should know that this very metabolic pathway with one or two\nadditional reactions gives rise to a variety of metabolic end products. In\nour skeletal muscle, under anaerobic conditions, lactic acid is formed.\nUnder normal aerobic conditions, pyruvic acid is formed. In yeast,  during\nfermentation, the same pathway leads to the production of ethanol\n(alcohol). Hence, in different conditions different products are possible.\n\n9.12.2 How do Enzymes bring about such High Rates of\nChemical Conversions?\n\nTo understand this we should study enzymes a little more. We have already\nunderstood the idea of an ‘active site’. The chemical or metabolic conversion\nrefers to a reaction. The chemical which is converted into a product is\ncalled a ‘substrate’. Hence enzymes, i.e. proteins with three dimensional\nstructures including an ‘active site’, convert a substrate (S) into a product\n(P). Symbolically, this can be depicted as:\n\nS → P\n\nIt is now understood that the substrate ‘S’ has to bind the enzyme at\nits ‘active site’ within a given cleft or pocket. The substrate has to diffuse\n\n←\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n156 BIOLOGY\n\ntowards the ‘active site’. There is thus, an\nobligatory formation of an ‘ES’ complex. E\nstands for enzyme. This complex formation is\na transient phenomenon. During the state\nwhere substrate is bound to the enzyme active\nsite, a new structure of the substrate called\ntransition state structure is formed. Very soon,\nafter the expected bond breaking/making is\ncompleted, the product is released from the\nactive site. In other words, the structure of\nsubstrate gets transformed into the structure\nof product(s). The pathway of this\ntransformation must go through the so-called\ntransition state structure. There could be\nmany more ‘altered structural states’ between\nthe stable substrate and the product. Implicit\nin this statement is the fact that all other\n\nintermediate structural states are unstable. Stability is something related\nto energy status of the molecule or the structure. Hence, when we look at\nthis pictorially through a graph it looks like something as in Figure 9.6.\n\nThe y-axis represents the potential energy content. The x-axis\nrepresents the progression of the structural transformation or states\nthrough the ‘transition state’. You would notice two things. The energy\nlevel difference between S and P. If ‘P’ is at a lower level than ‘S’, the reaction\nis an exothermic reaction. One need not supply energy (by heating) in\norder to form the product. However, whether it is an exothermic or\nspontaneous reaction or an endothermic or energy requiring reaction,\nthe ‘S’ has to go through a much higher energy state or transition state.\nThe difference in average energy content of ‘S’ from that of this transition\nstate is called ‘activation energy’.\n\nEnzymes eventually bring down this energy barrier making the\ntransition of ‘S’ to ‘P’ more easy.\n\n9.12.3 Nature of Enzyme Action\n\nEach enzyme (E) has a substrate (S) binding site in its molecule so that a\nhighly reactive enzyme-substrate complex (ES) is produced. This\ncomplex is short-lived and dissociates into its product(s) P and the\nunchanged enzyme with an intermediate formation of the enzyme-product\ncomplex (EP).\n\nThe formation of the ES complex is essential for catalysis.\n\nE + S ���⇀↽���  ES  \uf8e7 →\uf8e7  EP \uf8e7 →\uf8e7   E + P\n\nActivation energy\nwithout enzyme\n\nP\no\nte\n\nn\nti\n\na\nl \nE\n\nn\ne\nr\ng\ny\n\nActivation\nenergy with enzyme\n\nSubstrate (s)\n\nProduct (P)\n\nProgress of reaction\n\nTransition state\n\nFigure  9.6 Concept of activation energy\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nBIOMOLECULES 157\n\nThe catalytic cycle of an enzyme action can be described in the following\nsteps:\n\n1. First, the substrate binds to the active site of the enzyme, fitting\ninto the active site.\n\n2. The binding of the substrate induces the enzyme to alter its shape,\nfitting more tightly around the substrate.\n\n3. The active site of the enzyme, now in close proximity of the\nsubstrate breaks the chemical bonds of the substrate and the\nnew enzyme- product complex is formed.\n\n4. The enzyme releases the products of the reaction and the free\nenzyme is ready to bind to another molecule of the substrate and\nrun through the catalytic cycle once again.\n\n9.12.4 Factors Affecting Enzyme Activity\n\nThe activity of an enzyme can be affected by a change in the conditions\nwhich can alter the tertiary structure of the protein. These include\ntemperature, pH, change in substrate concentration or binding of specific\nchemicals that regulate its activity.\n\nTemperature and pH\n\nEnzymes generally function in a narrow range of temperature and pH\n(Figure 9.7). Each enzyme shows its highest activity at a particular\ntemperature and pH called the optimum temperature and optimum pH.\nActivity declines both below and above the optimum value. Low\ntemperature preserves the enzyme in a temporarily inactive state whereas\nhigh temperature destroys enzymatic activity because proteins are\ndenatured by heat.\n\nFigure 9.7 Effect of change in : (a) pH  (b) Temperature and (c) Concentration of\nsubstrate on enzyme activity\n\nVmax\n\nV\ne\nlo\n\nc\nit\n\ny\no\nf \nr\ne\na\nc\nti\n\no\nn\n\n(V\n)\n\n[S]\n\nV\n\n2\n\nmax\n\nKm\n\n(a) (b) (c)\n\npH Temperature\n\nE\nn\n\nz\ny\nm\n\ne\na\nc\nti\n\nv\nit\n\ny\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n158 BIOLOGY\n\nConcentration of Substrate\n\nWith the increase in substrate concentration, the velocity of the enzymatic\nreaction rises at first. The reaction ultimately reaches a maximum velocity\n(Vmax) which is not exceeded by any further rise in concentration of the\nsubstrate. This is because the enzyme molecules are fewer than the\nsubstrate molecules and after saturation of these molecules, there are no\nfree enzyme molecules to bind with the additional substrate molecules\n(Figure 9.7).\n\nThe activity of an enzyme is also sensitive to the presence of specific\nchemicals that bind to the enzyme. When the binding of the chemical\nshuts off enzyme activity, the process is called inhibition and the chemical\nis called an inhibitor.\n\nWhen the inhibitor closely resembles the substrate in its molecular\nstructure and inhibits the activity of the enzyme, it is known as\ncompetitive inhibitor. Due to its close structural similarity with the\nsubstrate, the inhibitor competes with the substrate for the substrate-\nbinding site of the enzyme. Consequently, the substrate cannot bind and\nas a result, the enzyme action declines, e.g., inhibition of succinic\ndehydrogenase by malonate which closely resembles the substrate\nsuccinate in structure. Such competitive inhibitors are often used in the\ncontrol of bacterial pathogens.\n\n9.12.5 Classification and Nomenclature of Enzymes\n\nThousands of enzymes have been discovered, isolated and studied. Most\nof these enzymes have been classified into different groups based on the\ntype of reactions they catalyse. Enzymes are divided into 6 classes each\nwith 4-13 subclasses and named accordingly by a four-digit number.\n\nOxidoreductases/dehydrogenases: Enzymes which catalyse\noxidoreduction between two substrates S and S’ e.g.,\n\nS reduced + S’ oxidised \uf8e7 →\uf8e7  S oxidised + S’ reduced.\n\nTransferases: Enzymes catalysing a transfer of a group, G (other than\nhydrogen) between a pair of substrate S and S’ e.g.,\n\nS - G + S’  \uf8e7 →\uf8e7  S + S’ - G\n\nHydrolases: Enzymes catalysing hydrolysis of ester, ether, peptide,\nglycosidic, C-C, C-halide or P-N bonds.\n\nLyases: Enzymes that catalyse removal of groups from substrates by\nmechanisms other than hydrolysis leaving double bonds.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nBIOMOLECULES 159\n\nIsomerases: Includes all enzymes catalysing inter-conversion of optical,\ngeometric or positional isomers.\n\nLigases: Enzymes catalysing the linking together of 2 compounds, e.g.,\nenzymes which catalyse joining of C-O, C-S, C-N,  P-O etc. bonds.\n\n9.12.6 Co-factors\n\nEnzymes are composed of one or several polypeptide chains. However,\nthere are a number of cases in which non-protein constituents called co-\nfactors are bound to the the enzyme to make the enzyme catalytically\nactive. In these instances, the protein portion of the enzymes is called the\napoenzyme. Three kinds of cofactors may be identified: prosthetic groups,\nco-enzymes and metal ions.\n\nProsthetic groups are organic compounds and are distinguished from\nother cofactors in that they are tightly bound to the apoenzyme. For\nexample, in peroxidase and catalase, which catalyze the breakdown of\nhydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen, haem is the prosthetic group\nand it is a part of the active site of the enzyme.\n\nCo-enzymes are also organic compounds but their association with\nthe apoenzyme is only transient, usually occurring during the course of\ncatalysis. Furthermore, co-enzymes serve as co-factors in a number of\ndifferent enzyme catalyzed reactions. The essential chemical components\nof many coenzymes are vitamins, e.g., coenzyme nicotinamide adenine\ndinucleotide (NAD) and NADP contain the vitamin niacin.\n\nA number of enzymes require metal ions for their activity which form\ncoordination bonds with side chains at the active site and at the same\ntime form one or more cordination bonds with the substrate, e.g., zinc is\na cofactor for the proteolytic enzyme carboxypeptidase.\n\nCatalytic  activity is lost when the co-factor is removed from the enzyme\nwhich testifies that they play a crucial role in the catalytic activity of the\nenzyme.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nAlthough there is a bewildering diversity of living organisms, their chemical\ncomposition and metabolic reactions appear to be remarkably similar. The\nelemental composition of living tissues and non-living matter appear also to be\nsimilar when analysed qualitatively. However, a closer examination reveals that\nthe relative abundance of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen is higher in living systems\nwhen compared to inanimate matter. The most abundant chemical in living\norganisms is water. There are thousands of small molecular weight (<1000 Da)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n160 BIOLOGY\n\nbiomolecules. Amino acids, monosaccharide and disaccharide sugars, fatty acids,\nglycerol, nucleotides, nucleosides and nitrogen bases are some of the organic\ncompounds seen in living organisms. There are 20 types of amino acids and 5\ntypes of nucleotides. Fats and oils are glycerides in which fatty acids are esterified\nto glycerol. Phospholipids contain, in addition, a phosphorylated nitrogenous\ncompound.\n\nOnly three types of macromolecules, i.e., proteins, nucleic acids and\npolysaccharides are found in living systems. Lipids, because of their association\nwith membranes separate in the macromolecular fraction. Biomacromolecules\nare polymers. They are made of building blocks which are different. Proteins\nare heteropolymers made of amino acids. Nucleic acids (RNA and DNA) are\ncomposed of nucleotides. Biomacromolecules have a hierarchy of structures –\nprimary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary. Nucleic acids serve as genetic\nmaterial. Polysaccharides are components of cell wall in plants, fungi and also\nof the exoskeleton of arthropods. They also are storage forms of energy (e.g.,\nstarch and glycogen). Proteins serve a variety of cellular functions. Many of\nthem are enzymes, some are antibodies, some are receptors, some are hormones\nand some others are structural proteins. Collagen is the most abundant protein\nin animal world and Ribulose bisphosphate Carboxylase-Oxygenase (RuBisCO)\nis the most abundant protein in the whole of the biosphere.\n\nEnzymes are proteins which catalyse biochemical reactions in the cells.\nRibozymes are nucleic acids with catalytic power. Proteinaceous enzymes\nexhibit substrate specificity, require optimum temperature and pH for maximal\nactivity. They are denatured at high temperatures. Enzymes lower activation\nenergy of reactions and enhance greatly the rate of the reactions. Nucleic acids\ncarry hereditary information and are passed on from parental generation to\nprogeny.\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1. What are macromolecules? Give examples.\n\n2.

You may wonder how a single cell then goes on to form such\n\nlarge organisms. Growth and reproduction are characteristics of cells,\n\nindeed of all living organisms. All cells reproduce by dividing into two,\n\nwith each parental cell giving rise to two daughter cells each time they\n\ndivide. These newly formed daughter cells can themselves grow and divide,\n\ngiving rise to a new cell population that is formed by the growth and\n\ndivision of a single parental cell and its progeny. In other words, such\n\ncycles of growth and division allow a single cell to form a structure\n\nconsisting of millions of cells.\n\n10.1 CELL CYCLE\n\nCell division is a very important  process in all living organisms. During\n\nthe division of a cell, DNA replication and cell growth also take place. All\n\nthese processes, i.e., cell division, DNA replication, and cell growth, hence,\n\nhave to take place in a coordinated way to ensure correct division and\n\nformation of progeny cells containing intact genomes. The sequence of\n\nevents by which a cell duplicates its genome, synthesises the other\n\nconstituents of the cell and eventually divides into two daughter cells is\n\ntermed cell cycle. Although cell growth (in terms of cytoplasmic increase)\n\nis a continuous process, DNA synthesis occurs only during one specific\n\nstage in the cell cycle. The replicated chromosomes (DNA) are then\n\ndistributed to daughter nuclei by a complex series of events during cell\n\ndivision. These events are themselves under genetic control.\n\nCELL CYCLE AND CELL DIVISION\n\nCHAPTER  10\n\n10.1 Cell Cycle\n\n10.2 M Phase\n\n10.3 Significance of\n\nMitosis\n\n10.4 Meiosis\n\n10.5 Significance of\n\nMeiosis\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nCELL CYCLE AND CELL DIVISION 163\n\n10.1.1 Phases of Cell Cycle\n\nA typical eukaryotic cell cycle is illustrated by\n\nhuman cells in culture. These cells divide once\n\nin approximately every 24 hours (Figure 10.1).\n\nHowever, this duration of cell cycle can vary from\n\norganism to organism and also from cell type\n\nto cell type. Yeast for example, can progress\n\nthrough the cell cycle in only about 90 minutes.\n\nThe cell cycle is divided into two basic\n\nphases:\n\nlllll Interphase\n\nlllll M Phase (Mitosis phase)\n\nThe M Phase represents the phase when the\n\nactual cell division or mitosis occurs and the\n\ninterphase represents the phase between two\n\nsuccessive M phases. It is significant to note\n\nthat in the 24 hour average duration of cell\n\ncycle of a human cell, cell division proper lasts\n\nfor only about an hour. The interphase lasts\n\nmore than 95% of the duration of cell cycle.\n\nThe M Phase starts with the nuclear division, corresponding to the\n\nseparation of daughter chromosomes (karyokinesis) and usually ends\n\nwith division of cytoplasm (cytokinesis). The interphase, though  called\n\nthe resting phase,  is the time during which the cell is preparing for division\n\nby undergoing both cell growth and DNA replication in an orderly manner.\n\nThe interphase is divided into three further phases:\n\nlllll G\n1\n phase (Gap 1)\n\nlllll S phase  (Synthesis)\n\nlllll G\n2\n phase (Gap 2)\n\n G\n1\n phase corresponds to the interval between mitosis and initiation\n\nof DNA replication. During G\n1\n phase the cell is metabolically active and\n\ncontinuously grows but does not replicate its DNA. S or synthesis  phase\n\nmarks the period during which DNA synthesis or replication takes place.\n\nDuring this time the amount of DNA per cell doubles.  If the initial amount\n\nof DNA is denoted as 2C then it increases to 4C. However, there is no\n\nincrease in the chromosome number; if the cell had diploid or 2n number\n\nof chromosomes at G\n1\n, even after S phase the number of chromosomes\n\nremains the same, i.e., 2n.\n\nIn animal cells, during the S phase, DNA replication begins in the\n\nnucleus, and the centriole duplicates in the cytoplasm. During the G\n2\n\nphase, proteins are synthesised in preparation for mitosis while cell growth\n\ncontinues.\n\nHow do plants and\nanimals continue to\ngrow all their lives?\nDo all cells in a plant\ndivide all the time?\nDo you think all cells\ncontinue to divide in\nall plants and\nanimals? Can you\ntell the name and the\nlocation of tissues\nhaving cells that\ndivide all their life in\nhigher plants? Do\nanimals have similar\nm e r i s t e m a t i c\ntissues?\n\nFigure 10.1 A diagrammatic view of cell cycle\nindicating formation of two cells\nfrom one cell\n\nM\n \nP\nh\n\na\ns\ne\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n164 BIOLOGY\n\nSome cells in the adult animals do not appear to exhibit division (e.g.,\nheart cells) and many other cells divide only occasionally, as needed to\nreplace cells that have been lost because of injury or cell death. These\ncells that do not divide further exit G\n\n1\n phase to enter an inactive stage\n\ncalled quiescent stage (G\n0\n) of the cell cycle. Cells in this stage remain\n\nmetabolically active but no longer proliferate unless called on to do so\ndepending on the requirement of the organism.\n\nIn animals, mitotic cell division is only seen in the diploid somatic\ncells. However, there are few exceptions to this where haploid cells divide\nby mitosis, for example, male honey bees. Against this, the plants can\nshow mitotic divisions in both haploid and diploid cells. From your\nrecollection of examples of alternation of generations in plants (Chapter 3)\nidentify plant species and stages at which mitosis is seen in haploid cells.\n\n10.2 M PHASE\n\nThis is the most dramatic period of the cell cycle, involving a major\nreorganisation of virtually all components of the cell. Since the number of\nchromosomes in the parent and progeny cells is the same, it is also called as\nequational division. Though for convenience mitosis has been divided\ninto four stages of nuclear division (karyokinesis), it is very essential to\nunderstand that cell division is a progressive process and very clear-cut\nlines cannot be drawn between various stages. Karyokinesis involves\nfollowing four stages:\n\nlllll Prophase\n\nlllll Metaphase\n\nlllll Anaphase\n\nlllll Telophase\n\n10.2.1 Prophase\n\nProphase which is the first stage of karyokinesis of mitosis follows the\nS and G\n\n2\n phases of interphase. In the S and G\n\n2\n phases the new DNA\n\nmolecules formed are not distinct but intertwined. Prophase is marked\nby the initiation of condensation of chromosomal material. The\nchromosomal material becomes untangled during the process of\nchromatin condensation (Figure 10.2 a). The centrosome, which had\nundergone duplication during S phase of interphase, now begins to move\ntowards opposite poles of the cell. The completion of prophase can thus\nbe marked by the following characteristic events:\n\nlllll Chromosomal material condenses to form compact mitotic\nchromosomes. Chromosomes are seen to be composed of two\nchromatids attached together at the centromere.\n\nlllll Centrosome which had undergone duplication during interphase,\nbegins to move towards opposite poles of the cell. Each centrosome\nradiates out microtubules called asters. The two asters together\n\nwith spindle fibres forms mitotic apparatus.\n\nYou have studied\nmitosis in onion root\ntip cells.  It has 16\nchromosomes in\neach cell.  Can you\ntell how many\nchromosomes will\nthe cell have at G\n\n1\n\nphase, after S phase,\nand after M phase?\nAlso, what will be the\nDNA content of the\ncells at G\n\n1\n, after S\n\nand at G\n2\n, if the\n\ncontent after M\nphase is 2C?\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nCELL CYCLE AND CELL DIVISION 165\n\nCells at the end of prophase, when viewed under the\n\nmicroscope, do not show golgi complexes, endoplasmic\n\nreticulum, nucleolus and the nuclear envelope.\n\n10.2.2 Metaphase\n\nThe complete disintegration of the nuclear envelope marks\n\nthe start of the second phase of mitosis, hence the\n\nchromosomes are spread through the cytoplasm of the cell.\n\nBy this stage, condensation of chromosomes is completed\n\nand they can be observed clearly under the microscope. This\n\nthen, is the stage at which morphology of chromosomes is\n\nmost easily studied. At this stage, metaphase chromosome\n\nis made up of two sister chromatids, which are held together\n\nby the centromere (Figure 10.2 b). Small disc-shaped\n\nstructures at the surface of the centromeres are called\n\nkinetochores. These structures serve as the sites of attachment\n\nof spindle fibres (formed by the spindle fibres) to the\n\nchromosomes that are moved into position at the centre of\n\nthe cell. Hence, the metaphase is characterised by all the\n\nchromosomes coming to lie at the equator with one chromatid\n\nof each chromosome connected by its kinetochore to spindle\n\nfibres from one pole and its sister chromatid connected by\n\nits kinetochore to spindle fibres from the opposite pole (Figure\n\n10.2 b). The plane of alignment of the chromosomes at\n\nmetaphase is referred to as the metaphase plate.  The key\n\nfeatures of metaphase are:\n\nlllll Spindle fibres attach to kinetochores of\n\nchromosomes.\n\nlllll Chromosomes are moved to spindle equator and get\n\naligned along metaphase plate through spindle fibres\n\nto both poles.\n\n10.2.3 Anaphase\n\nAt the onset of anaphase, each chromosome arranged at the\n\nmetaphase plate is split simultaneously and the two daughter\n\nchromatids, now referred to as daughter  chromosomes of\n\nthe future daughter nuclei, begin their migration towards\n\nthe two opposite poles. As each chromosome moves away\n\nfrom the equatorial plate, the centromere of each chromosome\n\nremains directed towards the pole and hence at the leading\n\nedge, with the arms of the chromosome trailing behind\n\n(Figure 10.2 c). Thus, anaphase stage is characterised by\nFigure 10.2 a and b : A diagrammatic\nview of stages in mitosis\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n166 BIOLOGY\n\nthe following key events:\n\nlllll Centromeres split and chromatids separate.\n\nlllll Chromatids move to opposite poles.\n\n10.2.4 Telophase\n\nAt the beginning of the final stage of karyokinesis, i.e.,\n\ntelophase, the chromosomes that have reached their\n\nrespective poles decondense and lose their individuality. The\n\nindividual chromosomes can no longer be seen and each set\n\nof chromatin material tends to collect at each of the two poles\n\n(Figure 10.2 d). This is the stage which shows the following\n\nkey events:\n\nlllll Chromosomes cluster at opposite spindle poles and their\n\nidentity is lost as discrete elements.\n\nlllll Nuclear envelope develops around the chromosome\n\nclusters at each pole forming two daughter nuclei.\n\nlllll Nucleolus, golgi complex and ER reform.\n\n10.2.5 Cytokinesis\n\nMitosis accomplishes not only the segregation of duplicated\n\nchromosomes into daughter nuclei (karyokinesis), but the\n\ncell itself is divided into two daughter cells by the separation\n\nof cytoplasm called cytokinesis at the end of which cell\n\ndivision gets completed (Figure 10.2 e). In an animal cell,\n\nthis is achieved by the appearance of a furrow in the plasma\n\nmembrane. The furrow gradually deepens and ultimately\n\njoins in the centre dividing the cell cytoplasm into two. Plant\n\ncells however, are enclosed by a relatively inextensible cell\n\nwall, thererfore they undergo cytokinesis by a different\n\nmechanism. In plant cells, wall formation starts in the centre\n\nof the cell and grows outward to meet the existing lateral\n\nwalls. The formation of the new cell wall begins with the\n\nformation of a simple precursor, called the cell-plate that\n\nrepresents the middle lamella between the walls of two\n\nadjacent cells. At the time of cytoplasmic division, organelles\n\nlike mitochondria and plastids get distributed between the\n\ntwo daughter cells. In some organisms karyokinesis is not\n\nfollowed by cytokinesis as a result of which multinucleate\n\ncondition arises leading to the formation of syncytium (e.g.,\n\nliquid endosperm in coconut).\nFigure 10.2 c to e : A diagrammatic\nview of stages in Mitosis\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nCELL CYCLE AND CELL DIVISION 167\n\n10.3 Significance of Mitosis\n\nMitosis or the equational division is usually restricted to the diploid cells\n\nonly. However, in some lower plants and in some social insects haploid\n\ncells also divide by mitosis. It is very essential to understand the\n\nsignificance of this division in the life of an organism. Are you aware of\n\nsome examples where you have studied about haploid and diploid insects?\n\nMitosis usually results in the production of diploid daughter cells\n\nwith identical genetic complement. The growth of multicellular organisms\n\nis due to mitosis. Cell growth results in disturbing the ratio between the\n\nnucleus and the cytoplasm. It therefore becomes essential for the cell to\n\ndivide to restore the nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio. A very significant\n\ncontribution of mitosis is cell repair. The cells of the upper layer of the\n\nepidermis, cells of the lining of the gut, and blood cells are being constantly\n\nreplaced. Mitotic divisions in the meristematic tissues – the apical and\n\nthe lateral cambium, result in a continuous growth of plants throughout\n\ntheir life.\n\n10.4 MEIOSIS\n\nThe production of offspring by sexual reproduction includes the fusion\n\nof two gametes, each with a complete haploid set of chromosomes. Gametes\n\nare formed from specialised diploid cells. This specialised kind of cell\n\ndivision that reduces the chromosome number by half results in the\n\nproduction of haploid daughter cells. This kind of division is called\n\nmeiosis. Meiosis ensures the production of haploid phase in the life cycle\n\nof sexually reproducing organisms whereas fertilisation restores the diploid\n\nphase. We come across meiosis during gametogenesis in plants and\n\nanimals. This leads to the formation of haploid gametes. The key features\n\nof meiosis are as follows:\n\nlllll Meiosis involves two sequential cycles of nuclear and cell division called\nmeiosis I and meiosis II but only a single cycle of DNA replication.\n\nlllll Meiosis I is initiated after the parental chromosomes have replicated\nto produce identical sister chromatids at the S phase.\n\nlllll Meiosis involves pairing of homologous chromosomes and\nrecombination between non-sister chromatids of homologous\nchromosomes.\n\nlllll Four haploid cells are formed at the end of meiosis II.\n\nMeiotic events can be grouped under the following phases:\n\nMeiosis I Meiosis II\n\nProphase I Prophase II\n\nMetaphase I Metaphase II\n\nAnaphase I Anaphase II\n\nTelophase I Telophase II\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n168 BIOLOGY\n\n10.4.1 Meiosis I\n\nProphase I: Prophase of the first meiotic division is typically longer and\n\nmore complex when compared to prophase of mitosis. It has been further\n\nsubdivided into the following five phases based on chromosomal\n\nbehaviour, i.e., Leptotene, Zygotene, Pachytene, Diplotene and Diakinesis.\n\nDuring leptotene stage the chromosomes become gradually visible\n\nunder the light microscope. The compaction of chromosomes continues\n\nthroughout leptotene. This is followed by the second stage of prophase\n\nI called zygotene. During this stage chromosomes start pairing together\n\nand this process of association is called synapsis. Such paired\n\nchromosomes are called homologous chromosomes. Electron\n\nmicrographs of this stage indicate that chromosome synapsis is\n\naccompanied by the formation of complex structure called\n\nsynaptonemal complex. The complex formed by a pair of synapsed\n\nhomologous chromosomes is called a bivalent or a tetrad. However,\n\nthese are more clearly visible at the next stage. The first two stages of\n\nprophase I are relatively short-lived compared to the next stage that is\n\npachytene. During this stage, the four chromatids of each bivalent\n\nchromosomes becomes distinct and clearly appears as tetrads. This stage\n\nis characterised by the appearance of recombination nodules, the sites\n\nat which crossing over occurs between non-sister chromatids of the\n\nhomologous chromosomes. Crossing over is the exchange of genetic\n\nmaterial between two homologous chromosomes. Crossing over is also\n\nan enzyme-mediated process and the enzyme involved is called\n\nrecombinase. Crossing over leads to recombination of genetic material\n\non the two chromosomes. Recombination between homologous\n\nchromosomes is completed by the end of pachytene, leaving the\n\nchromosomes linked at the sites of crossing over.\n\nThe beginning of diplotene is recognised by the dissolution of the\n\nsynaptonemal complex and the tendency of the recombined\n\nhomologous chromosomes of the bivalents to separate from each other\n\nexcept at the sites of crossovers. These X-shaped structures, are called\n\nchiasmata. In oocytes of some vertebrates, diplotene can last for\n\nmonths or years.\n\nThe final stage of meiotic prophase I is diakinesis. This is marked by\n\nterminalisation of chiasmata. During this phase the chromosomes are\n\nfully condensed and the meiotic spindle is assembled to prepare the\n\nhomologous chromosomes for separation. By the end of diakinesis, the\n\nnucleolus disappears and the nuclear envelope also breaks down.\n\nDiakinesis represents transition to metaphase.\n\nMetaphase I: The bivalent chromosomes align on the equatorial plate\n\n(Figure 10.3). The microtubules from the opposite poles of the spindle\n\nattach to the kinetochore of homologous chromosomes.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nCELL CYCLE AND CELL DIVISION 169\n\nAnaphase I: The homologous chromosomes separate, while sister\n\nchromatids remain associated at their centromeres (Figure 10.3).\n\nTelophase I: The nuclear membrane and nucleolus reappear, cytokinesis\n\nfollows and this is called as dyad of cells (Figure 10.3). Although in many\n\ncases the chromosomes do undergo some dispersion, they do not reach\n\nthe extremely extended state of the interphase nucleus. The stage between\n\nthe two meiotic divisions is called interkinesis and is generally short lived.\n\nThere is no replication of DNA during interkinesis. Interkinesis is followed\n\nby prophase II, a much simpler prophase than prophase I.\n\n10.4.2 Meiosis II\n\nProphase II: Meiosis II is initiated immediately after cytokinesis, usually\n\nbefore the chromosomes have fully elongated.  In contrast to meiosis I,\n\nmeiosis II resembles a normal mitosis. The nuclear membrane disappears\n\nby the end of prophase II (Figure 10.4). The chromosomes again become\n\ncompact.\n\nMetaphase II: At this stage the chromosomes align at the equator and\n\nthe microtubules from opposite poles of the spindle get attached to the\n\nkinetochores (Figure 10.4) of sister chromatids.\n\nAnaphase II: It begins with the simultaneous splitting of the centromere\n\nof each chromosome  (which was holding the sister chromatids together),\n\nallowing them to move toward opposite poles of the cell (Figure 10.4) by\n\nshortening of microtubules attached to kinetochores.\n\nFigure 10.3 Stages of Meiosis I\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n170 BIOLOGY\n\nTelophase II: Meiosis ends with telophase II, in which the two\n\ngroups of chromosomes once again get enclosed by a nuclear\n\nenvelope; cytokinesis follows resulting in the formation of tetrad\n\nof cells i.e., four haploid daughter cells (Figure 10.4).\n\n10.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF MEIOSIS\n\nMeiosis is the mechanism by which conservation of specific\n\nchromosome number of each species is achieved across\n\ngenerations in sexually reproducing organisms, even though the\n\nprocess, per se, paradoxically, results in reduction of chromosome\n\nnumber by half. It also increases the genetic variability in the\n\npopulation of organisms from one generation to the next. Variations\n\nare very important for the process of evolution.\n\nFigure 10.4 Stages of Meiosis II\n\nSUMMARY\n\nAccording to the cell theory, cells arise from preexisting cells. The process by\n\nwhich this occurs is called cell division. Any sexually reproducing organism\n\nstarts its life cycle from a single-celled zygote. Cell division does not stop with\n\nthe formation of the mature organism but continues throughout its life cycle.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nCELL CYCLE AND CELL DIVISION 171\n\nThe stages through which a cell passes from one division to the next is called\n\nthe cell cycle. Cell cycle is divided into two phases called (i) Interphase – a\n\nperiod of preparation for cell division, and (ii) Mitosis (M phase) – the actual\n\nperiod of cell division. Interphase is further subdivided into G\n1\n, S and G\n\n2\n. G\n\n1\n\nphase is the period when the cell grows and carries out normal metabolism.\n\nMost of the organelle duplication also occurs during this phase. S phase marks\n\nthe phase of DNA replication and chromosome duplication. G\n2\n phase is the\n\nperiod of cytoplasmic growth. Mitosis is also divided into four stages namely\n\nprophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase. Chromosome condensation\n\noccurs during prophase. Simultaneously, the centrioles move to the opposite\n\npoles. The nuclear envelope and the nucleolus disappear and the spindle\n\nfibres start appearing. Metaphase is marked by the alignment of chromosomes\n\nat the equatorial plate. During anaphase the centromeres divide and the\n\nchromatids start moving towards the two opposite poles. Once the chromatids\n\nreach the two poles, the chromosomal elongation starts, nucleolus and the\n\nnuclear membrane reappear. This stage is called the telophase.  Nuclear\n\ndivision is then followed by the cytoplasmic division and is called cytokinesis.\n\nMitosis thus, is the equational division in which the chromosome number of\n\nthe parent is conserved in the daughter cell.\n\nIn contrast to mitosis, meiosis occurs in the diploid cells, which are destined to\n\nform gametes. It is called the reduction division since it reduces the chromosome\n\nnumber by half while making the gametes. In sexual reproduction when the two\n\ngametes fuse the chromosome number is restored to the value in the parent.\n\nMeiosis is divided into two phases – meiosis I and meiosis II. In the first meiotic\n\ndivision the homologous chromosomes pair to form bivalents, and undergo crossing\n\nover. Meiosis I has a long prophase, which is divided further into five phases.\n\nThese are leptotene, zygotene, pachytene, diplotene and diakinesis. During\n\nmetaphase I the bivalents arrange on the equatorial plate. This is followed by\n\nanaphase I in which homologous chromosomes move to the opposite poles with\n\nboth their chromatids. Each pole receives half the chromosome number of the\n\nparent cell. In telophase I, the nuclear membrane and nucleolus reappear. Meiosis\n\nII is similar to mitosis. During anaphase II the sister chromatids separate. Thus at\n\nthe end of meiosis four haploid cells are formed.\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1. What is the average cell cycle span for a mammalian cell?\n\n2.

The two perspectives essentially rested on two levels of\n\norganisation of life forms and phenomena. One described at organismic\n\nand above level of organisation while the second described at cellular\n\nand molecular level of organisation. The first resulted in ecology and\n\nrelated disciplines. The second resulted in physiology and biochemistry.\n\nDescription of physiological processes, in flowering plants as an\n\nexample, is what is given in the chapters in this unit. The processes of\n\nmineral nutrition of plants, photosynthesis, transport, respiration and\n\nultimately plant growth and development are described in molecular\n\nterms but in the context of cellular activities and even at organism\n\nlevel. Wherever appropriate, the relation of the physiological processes\n\nto environment is also discussed.\n\nPLANT PHYSIOLOGY\n\nChapter 11\nTransport in Plants\n\nChapter 12\nMineral Nutrition\n\nChapter 13\nPhotosynthesis in Higher\nPlants\n\nChapter 14\nRespiration in Plants\n\nChapter 15\nPlant Growth and\nDevelopment\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMELVIN CALVIN born in Minnesota in April, 1911, received his\n\nPh.D. in Chemistry from the University of Minnesota. He served\n\nas Professor of Chemistry at the University of California,\n\nBerkeley.\n\nJust after world war II, when the world was under shock\n\nafter the Hiroshima-Nagasaki bombings, and seeing the ill-\n\neffects of radio-activity, Calvin and co-workers put radio-\n\nactivity to beneficial use. He along with J.A. Bassham studied\n\nreactions in green plants forming sugar and other substances\n\nfrom raw materials like carbon dioxide, water and minerals\n\nby labelling the carbon dioxide with C\n14\n\n. Calvin proposed that\n\nplants change light energy to chemical energy by transferring\n\nan electron in an organised array of pigment molecules and\n\nother substances. The mapping of the pathway of carbon\n\nassimilation in photosynthesis earned him Nobel Prize in 1961.\n\nThe principles of photosynthesis as established by Calvin\n\nare, at present, being used in studies on renewable resource\n\nfor energy and materials and basic studies in solar energy\n\nresearch.Melvin Calvin\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nHave you ever wondered how water reaches the top of tall trees, or for that\n\nmatter how and why substances move from one cell to the other, whether\n\nall substances move in a similar way, in the same direction and whether\n\nmetabolic energy is required for moving substances.  Plants need to move\n\nmolecules over very long distances, much more than animals do; they also\n\ndo not have a circulatory system in place.  Water taken up by the roots has\n\nto reach all parts of the plant, up to the very tip of the growing stem.  The\n\nphotosynthates or food synthesised by the leaves have also to be moved to\n\nall parts including the root tips embedded deep inside the soil.  Movement\n\nacross short distances, say within the cell, across the membranes and from\n\ncell to cell within the tissue has also to take place. To understand some of\n\nthe transport processes that take place in plants, one would have to recollect\n\none’s basic knowledge about the structure of the cell and the anatomy of\n\nthe plant body.  We also need to revisit our understanding of diffusion,\n\nbesides gaining some knowledge about chemical potential and ions.\n\nWhen we talk of the movement of substances we need first to define\n\nwhat kind of movement we are talking about, and also what substances\n\nwe are looking at. In a flowering plant the substances that would need to\n\nbe transported are water, mineral nutrients, organic nutrients and plant\n\ngrowth regulators. Over small distances substances move by diffusion\n\nand by cytoplasmic streaming supplemented by active transport.\n\nTransport over longer distances proceeds through the vascular system\n\n(the xylem and the phloem) and is called translocation.\n\nAn important aspect that needs to be considered is the direction of\n\ntransport. In rooted plants, transport in xylem (of water and minerals) is\n\nessentially unidirectional, from roots to the stems. Organic and mineral\n\nnutrients however, undergo multidirectional transport. Organic\n\nTRANSPORT IN PLANTS\n\nCHAPTER  11\n\n11.1 Means of\n\nTransport\n\n11.2 Plant-Water\n\nRelations\n\n11.3 Long Distance\n\nTransport of\n\nWater\n\n11.4 Transpiration\n\n11.5 Uptake and\n\nTransport of\n\nMineral\n\nNutrients\n\n11.6   Phloem\n\nTransport: Flow\n\nfrom Source to\n\nSink\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n176 BIOLOGY\n\ncompounds synthesised in the photosynthetic leaves are exported to all\n\nother parts of the plant including storage organs.  From the storage organs\n\nthey are later re-exported.  The mineral nutrients are taken up by the\n\nroots and transported upwards into the stem, leaves and the growing\n\nregions.  When any plant part undergoes senescence, nutrients may be\n\nwithdrawn from such regions and moved to the growing parts.  Hormones\n\nor plant growth regulators and other chemical signals are also transported,\n\nthough in very small amounts, sometimes in a strictly polarised or\n\nunidirectional manner from where they are synthesised to other parts.\n\nHence, in a flowering plant there is a complex traffic of compounds (but\n\nprobably very orderly) moving in different directions, each organ receiving\n\nsome substances and giving out some others.\n\n11.1 MEANS OF TRANSPORT\n\n11.1.1 Diffusion\n\nMovement by diffusion is passive, and may be from one part of the cell to\n\nthe other, or from cell to cell, or over short distances, say, from the inter-\n\ncellular spaces of the leaf to the outside.  No energy expenditure takes place.\n\nIn diffusion, molecules move in a random fashion, the net result being\n\nsubstances moving from regions of higher concentration to regions of lower\n\nconcentration.  Diffusion is a slow process and is not dependent on a ‘living\n\nsystem’. Diffusion is obvious in gases and liquids, but diffusion in solids is\n\nmore likely rather than of solids. Diffusion is very important to plants since\n\nit is the only means for gaseous movement within the plant body.\n\nDiffusion rates are affected by the gradient of concentration, the\n\npermeability of the membrane separating them, temperature and pressure.\n\n11.1.2 Facilitated Diffusion\n\nAs pointed out earlier, a gradient must already be present for diffusion to\n\noccur.  The diffusion rate depends on the size of the substances; obviously\n\nsmaller substances diffuse faster.  The diffusion of any substance across a\n\nmembrane also depends on its solubility in lipids, the major constituent of\n\nthe membrane. Substances soluble in lipids diffuse through the membrane\n\nfaster.  Substances that have a hydrophilic moiety, find it difficult to pass\n\nthrough the membrane; their movement has to be facilitated.  Membrane\n\nproteins provide sites at which such molecules cross the membrane.  They\n\ndo not set up a concentration gradient: a concentration gradient must\n\nalready be present for molecules to diffuse even if facilitated by the proteins.\n\nThis process is called facilitated diffusion.\n\nIn facilitated diffusion special proteins help move substances across\n\nmembranes without expenditure of ATP energy. Facilitated diffusion\n\ncannot cause net transport of molecules from a low to a high concentration\n\n– this would require input of energy.   Transport rate reaches a maximum\n\nwhen all of the protein transporters are being used (saturation).  Facilitated\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTRANSPORT IN PLANTS 177\n\ndiffusion is very specific: it allows cell to\n\nselect substances for uptake.  It is\n\nsensitive to inhibitors which react with\n\nprotein side chains.\n\nThe proteins form channels in the\n\nmembrane for molecules to pass through.\n\nSome channels are always open; others\n\ncan be controlled.  Some are large,\n\nallowing a variety of molecules to cross.\n\nThe porins are proteins that form large\n\npores in the outer membranes of the\n\nplastids, mitochondria and some bacteria\n\nallowing molecules up to the size of small\n\nproteins to pass through.\n\nFigure 11.1 shows an extracellular\n\nmolecule bound to the transport protein;\n\nthe transport protein then rotates and\n\nreleases the molecule inside the cell, e.g.,\n\nwater channels – made up of eight\n\ndifferent types of aquaporins.\n\n11.1.2.1 Passive symports and\n\nantiports\n\nSome carrier or transport proteins allow\n\ndiffusion only if two types of molecules\n\nmove together. In a symport, both\n\nmolecules cross the membrane in the same\n\ndirection; in an antiport, they move in\n\nopposite directions (Figure 11.2). When a\n\nFigure 11.1 Facilitated diffusion\n\nUniport\n\nCarrier protein\n\nMembrane\n\nAntiport\n\nSymport\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nB\n\nB\n\nFigure 11.2 Facilitated diffusion\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n178 BIOLOGY\n\nmolecule moves across a membrane independent of other molecules, the\n\nprocess is called uniport.\n\n11.1.3 Active Transport\n\nActive transport uses energy to transport and pump molecules against a\n\nconcentration gradient. Active transport is carried out by specific\n\nmembrane-proteins. Hence different proteins in the membrane play a\n\nmajor role in both active as well as passive transport. Pumps are proteins\n\nthat use energy to carry substances across the cell membrane. These\n\npumps can transport substances from a low concentration to a high\n\nconcentration (‘uphill’ transport).  Transport rate reaches a maximum\n\nwhen all the protein transporters are being used or are saturated.  Like\n\nenzymes the carrier protein is very specific in what it carries across the\n\nmembrane.  These proteins are sensitive to inhibitors that react with protein\n\nside chains.\n\n11.1.4 Comparison of Different Transport Processes\n\nTable 11.1 gives a comparison of the different transport mechanisms.\n\nProteins in the membrane are responsible for facilitated diffusion and\n\nactive transport and hence show common characterstics of being highly\n\nselective; they are liable to saturate, respond to inhibitors and are under\n\nhormonal regulation.  But diffusion whether facilitated or not – take place\n\nonly along a gradient and do not use energy.\n\nTABLE 11.1 Comparison of Different Transport Mechanisms\n\nProperty Simple Facilitated Active\nDiffusion Transport Transport\n\nRequires special membrane proteins  No  Yes  Yes\n\nHighly selective  No  Yes  Yes\n\nTransport saturates  No  Yes  Yes\n\nUphill transport  No  No  Yes\n\nRequires ATP energy  No  No  Yes\n\n11.2 PLANT-WATER RELATIONS\n\nWater is essential for all physiological activities of the plant and plays a\n\nvery important role in all living organisms.  It provides the medium in\n\nwhich most substances are dissolved. The protoplasm of the cells is\n\nnothing but water in which different molecules are dissolved and (several\n\nparticles) suspended. A watermelon has over 92 per cent water; most\n\nherbaceous plants have only about 10 to 15 per cent of its fresh weight\n\nas dry matter. Of course, distribution of water within a plant varies –\n\nwoody parts have relatively very little water, while soft parts mostly contain\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTRANSPORT IN PLANTS 179\n\nwater.  A seed may appear dry but it still has water – otherwise it would\n\nnot be alive and respiring!\n\nTerrestrial plants take up huge amount water daily but most of it is\n\nlost to the air through evaporation from the leaves, i.e., transpiration. A\n\nmature corn plant absorbs almost three litres of water in a day, while a\n\nmustard plant absorbs water equal to its own weight in about 5 hours.\n\nBecause of this high demand for water, it is not surprising that water is\n\noften the limiting factor for plant growth and productivity in both\n\nagricultural and natural environments.\n\n11.2.1 Water Potential\n\nTo comprehend plant-water relations, an understanding of certain\n\nstandard terms is necessary. Water potential (ΨΨΨΨΨ\nw\n) is a concept\n\nfundamental to understanding water movement.  Solute potential\n\n(ΨΨΨΨΨ\ns\n) and pressure potential (ΨΨΨΨΨ\n\np\n) are the two main components that\n\ndetermine water potential.\n\nWater molecules possess kinetic energy. In liquid and gaseous form\n\nthey are in  random motion that is both rapid and constant. The greater\n\nthe concentration of water in a system, the greater is its kinetic energy or\n\n‘water potential’.  Hence, it is obvious that pure water will have the greatest\n\nwater potential.  If two systems containing water are in contact, random\n\nmovement of water molecules will result in net movement of water\n\nmolecules from the system with higher energy to the one with lower energy.\n\nThus water will move from the system containing water at higher water\n\npotential\n \nto the one having low water potential\n\n.  \nThis process of movement\n\nof substances down a gradient of free energy is called diffusion. Water\n\npotential is denoted by the Greek symbol Psi or ΨΨΨΨΨ and is expressed in\n\npressure units such as pascals (Pa).  By convention, the water potential\n\nof pure water at standard temperatures, which is not under any pressure,\n\nis taken to be zero.\n\nIf some solute is dissolved in pure water, the solution has fewer free\n\nwater molecules and the concentration (free energy) of water decreases,\n\nreducing its water potential. Hence, all solutions have a lower water potential\n\nthan pure water; the magnitude of this lowering due to dissolution of a\n\nsolute is called solute potential or ΨΨΨΨΨ\ns\n.\n \n ΨΨΨΨΨ\n\ns \n is always negative.  The more\n\nthe solute molecules, the lower (more negative) is the Ψ\ns \n.\n \nFor a solution at\n\natmospheric pressure (water potential) Ψ\nw \n\n= (solute potential) \n \nΨ\n\ns\n.\n\nIf a pressure greater than atmospheric pressure is applied to pure\n\nwater or a solution, its water potential increases. It is equivalent to\n\npumping water from one place to another. Can you think of any system\n\nin our body where pressure is built up? Pressure can build up in a plant\n\nsystem\n \nwhen water enters a plant cell due to diffusion causing a pressure\n\nbuilt up against the cell wall, it makes the cell turgid (see section 11.2.2);\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n180 BIOLOGY\n\nthis increases the pressure potential. Pressure potential is usually\n\npositive, though in plants negative potential or tension in the water column\nin the xylem plays a major role in water transport up a stem.  Pressure\n\npotential is denoted as ΨΨΨΨΨp.\n\nWater potential of a cell is affected by both solute and pressure\npotential.  The relationship between them is as follows:\n\nΨΨΨΨΨ\nw \n\n= ΨΨΨΨΨ\ns \n+ ΨΨΨΨΨ\n\np\n\n11.2.2 Osmosis\n\nThe plant cell is surrounded by a cell membrane and a cell wall.  The cell\n\nwall is freely permeable to water and substances in solution hence is not\n\na barrier to movement. In plants the cells usually contain a large central\n\nvacuole, whose contents, the vacuolar sap, contribute to the solute\n\npotential of the cell. In plant cells, the cell membrane and the membrane\n\nof the vacuole, the tonoplast together are important determinants of\n\nmovement of molecules in or out of  the cell.\n\nOsmosis is the term used to refer specifically to the diffusion of water across\n\na differentially- or selectively permeable membrane. Osmosis occurs\n\nspontaneously in response to a driving force. The net direction and rate of osmosis\n\ndepends on both the pressure gradient and concentration gradient.  Water\n\nwill move from its region of higher chemical  potential (or concentration)  to its\n\nregion of lower chemical potential until equilibrium is reached. At equilibrium\n\nthe two chambers should have nearly the same water potential.\n\nYou may have made a potato osmometer in your earlier classes in\n\nschool. If the potato tuber is placed in water, the water enters the cavity in\n\nthe potato tuber containing a concentrated solution of sugar due to osmosis.\n\nStudy Figure 11.3 in which the two chambers, A and B, containing\n\nsolutions are separated by a semi-permeable membrane.\n\n(a) Solution of  which chamber has a lower water potential?\n\n(b) Solution of  which chamber has a lower solute potential?\n\n(c) In which direction will osmosis occur?\n\n(d) Which solution has a higher solute\n\npotential?\n\n(e) At equilibrium which chamber will\n\nhave lower water potential?\n\n(f) If one chamber has a Ψ Ψ Ψ Ψ Ψ of – 2000\n\nkPa, and the other – 1000 kPa, which\n\nis the chamber that has the higher\n\nΨΨΨΨΨ?\n\n(g) What will be the direction of the\nmovement of water when two\nsolutions with  Ψ\n\nw \n= 0.2 MPa and\n\nΨ\nw \n\n= 0.1 MPa are separated by a\nselectively permeable membrane?\n\nFigure 11.3\n\nA B\n\nSolute\nmolecule\n\nWater\n\nSemi-permeableSelectively permeable\nmembrane\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTRANSPORT IN PLANTS 181\n\nLet us discuss another experiment where a\n\nsolution of sucrose in water taken in a funnel is\n\nseparated from pure water in a beaker by a\n\nselectively permeable membrane (Figure 11.4).\n\nYou can get this kind of a membrane in an egg.\n\nRemove the yolk and albumin through a small\n\nhole at one end of the egg, and place the shell\n\nin dilute solution of hydrochloric acid for a few\n\nhours. The egg shell dissolves leaving the\n\nmembrane intact. Water will move into the funnel,\n\nresulting in rise in the level of the solution in the\n\nfunnel. This will continue till the equilibrium is\n\nreached. In case sucrose does diffuse out\n\nthrough the membrane, will this equilibrium be\n\never reached?\n\nExternal pressure can be applied from the\n\nupper part of the funnel such that no water\n\ndiffuses into the funnel through the membrane.\n\nThis pressure required to prevent water from\n\ndiffusing is in fact, the osmotic pressure and this\n\nis the function of the solute concentration; more\n\nthe solute concentration, greater will be the\n\npressure required to prevent water from diffusing\n\nin. Numerically osmotic pressure is equivalent\n\nto the osmotic potential, but the sign is\n\nopposite.Osmotic pressure is the positive\n\npressure applied, while osmotic potential is\n\nnegative.\n\n11.2.3 Plasmolysis\n\nThe behaviour of the plant cells (or tissues) with\n\nregard to water movement depends on the\n\nsurrounding solution. If the external solution\n\nbalances the osmotic pressure of the cytoplasm,\n\nit is said to be isotonic.  If the external solution\n\nis more dilute than the cytoplasm, it is\n\nhypotonic and if the external solution is more\n\nconcentrated, it is hypertonic. Cells swell in\n\nhypotonic solutions and shrink in hypertonic\n\nones.\n\nPlasmolysis occurs when water moves out of\n\nthe cell and the cell membrane of a plant cell\n\nshrinks away from its cell wall.  This occurs when\n\nFigure 11.4 A demonstration of osmosis. A\nthistle funnel is filled with\nsucrose solution and kept\ninverted in a beaker containing\nwater. (a) Water will diffuse\nacross the membrane (as\nshown by arrows) to raise the\nlevel of the solution in the\nfunnel (b) Pressure can be\napplied as shown to stop the\nwater movement into the\nfunnel\n\nSucrose\nsolution\n\nMembrane\n\nwater\n\n(a) (b)\n\nPressure\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n182 BIOLOGY\n\nthe cell (or tissue) is placed in a solution that is hypertonic (has more solutes)\n\nto the protoplasm. Water moves out; it is first lost from  the cytoplasm and\n\nthen from the vacuole. The water when drawn out of the cell through\n\ndiffusion into the extracellular (outside cell) fluid causes the protoplast to\n\nshrink away from the walls. The cell is said to be plasmolysed. The movement\n\nof water occurred across the membrane moving from an area of high water\n\npotential (i.e., the cell) to an area of lower water potential outside the cell\n\n(Figure 11.5).  \n\nWhat occupies the space between the cell wall and the shrunken\n\nprotoplast in the plasmolysed cell?\n\nWhen the cell (or tissue) is placed in an isotonic solution, there is no\n\nnet flow of water towards the inside or outside.  If the external solution\n\nbalances the osmotic pressure of the cytoplasm it is said to be isotonic.\n\nWhen water flows into the cell and out of the cell and are in equilibrium,\n\nthe cells are said to be flaccid. \n\nThe process of plasmolysis is usually reversible. When the cells are\n\nplaced in a hypotonic solution (higher water potential or dilute solution\n\nas compared to the cytoplasm), water diffuses into the cell causing the\n\ncytoplasm to build up a pressure against the wall, that is called turgor\n\npressure. The pressure exerted by the protoplasts due to entry of water\n\nagainst the rigid walls is called pressure potential ΨΨΨΨΨ\np.\n. Because of the\n\nrigidity of the cell wall, the cell does not rupture.  This turgor pressure is\n\nultimately responsible for enlargement and extension growth of cells.\n\nWhat would be the ΨΨΨΨΨ\np\n of a flaccid cell? Which organisms other than\n\nplants possess cell wall ?\n\n11.2.4 Imbibition\n\nImbibition is a special type of diffusion when water is absorbed by\n\nsolids – colloids – causing them to increase in volume.  The classical\n\nFigure 11.5 Plant cell plasmolysis\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTRANSPORT IN PLANTS 183\n\nexamples of imbibition are absorption of water by seeds and dry wood.\n\nThe pressure that is produced by the swelling of wood had been used by\n\nprehistoric man to split rocks and boulders.  If it were not for the pressure\n\ndue to imbibition, seedlings would not have been able to emerge out of\n\nthe soil into the open; they probably would not have been able to establish!\n\nImbibition is also diffusion since water movement is along a\n\nconcentration gradient; the seeds and other such materials have almost no\n\nwater hence they absorb water easily.  Water potential gradient between\n\nthe absorbent and the liquid imbibed is essential for imbibition.  In addition,\n\nfor any substance to imbibe any liquid, affinity between the adsorbant and\n\nthe liquid is also a pre-requisite.\n\n11.3 LONG DISTANCE TRANSPORT OF WATER\n\nAt some earlier stage you might have carried out an experiment where\n\nyou had placed a twig bearing white flowers in coloured water and had\n\nwatched it turn colour. On examining the cut end of the twig after a few\n\nhours you had noted the region through which the coloured water moved.\n\nThat experiment very easily demonstrates that the path of water movement\n\nis through the vascular bundles, more specifically, the xylem. Now we\n\nhave to go further and try and understand the mechanism of movement\n\nof water and other substances up a plant.\n\nLong distance transport of substances within a plant cannot be by\n\ndiffusion alone.  Diffusion is a slow process. It can account for only short\n\ndistance movement of molecules. For example, the movement of a molecule\n\nacross a typical plant cell (about 50 µm) takes approximately 2.5 s. At this\n\nrate, can you calculate how many years it would take for the movement\n\nof molecules over a distance of 1 m within a plant by diffusion alone?\n\nIn large and complex organisms, often substances have to be moved\n\nto long distances. Sometimes the sites of production or absorption and\n\nsites of storage are too far from each other; diffusion or active transport\n\nwould not suffice. Special long distance transport systems become\n\nnecessary so as to move substances across long distances and at a much\n\nfaster rate. Water and minerals, and food are generally moved by a mass\n\nor bulk flow system. Mass flow is the movement of substances in bulk or\n\nen masse from one point to another as a result of pressure differences\n\nbetween the two points. It is a characteristic of mass flow that substances,\n\nwhether in solution or in suspension, are swept along at the same pace,\n\nas in a flowing river. This is unlike diffusion where different substances\n\nmove independently depending on their concentration gradients. Bulk\n\nflow can be achieved either through a positive hydrostatic pressure\n\ngradient (e.g., a garden hose) or a negative hydrostatic pressure gradient\n\n(e.g., suction through a straw).\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n184 BIOLOGY\n\nThe bulk movement of substances through the conducting or vascular\n\ntissues of plants is called translocation.\n\nDo you remember studying cross sections of roots, stems and leaves\n\nof higher plants and studying the vascular system? The higher plants\n\nhave highly specialised vascular tissues – xylem and phloem. Xylem is\n\nassociated with translocation of mainly water, mineral salts, some organic\n\nnitrogen and hormones, from roots to the aerial parts of the plants. The\n\nphloem translocates a variety of organic and inorganic solutes, mainly\n\nfrom the leaves to other parts of the plants.\n\n11.3.1 How do Plants Absorb Water?\n\nWe know that the roots absorb most of the water that goes into plants;\n\nobviously that is why we apply water to the soil and not on the leaves.\n\nThe responsibility of absorption of water and minerals is more specifically\n\nthe function of the root hairs that are present in millions at the tips of the\n\nroots.  Root hairs are thin-walled slender extensions of root epidermal\n\ncells that greatly increase the surface area for absorption.  Water is\n\nabsorbed along with mineral solutes, by the root hairs, purely by diffusion.\n\nOnce water is absorbed by the root hairs, it can move deeper into root\n\nlayers by two distinct pathways:\n\n• apoplast pathway\n\n• symplast pathway\n\nThe apoplast is the system of adjacent cell walls that is continuous\n\nthroughout the plant, except at the casparian strips of the endodermis\n\nin the roots (Figure 11.6).  The apoplastic movement of water occurs\n\nexclusively through the intercellular spaces and the walls of the cells.\n\nMovement through the apoplast does not involve crossing the cell\n\nFigure 11.6 Pathway of water movement in the root\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTRANSPORT IN PLANTS 185\n\nmembrane. This movement is dependent on the gradient. The apoplast\n\ndoes not provide any barrier to water movement and water movement is\n\nthrough mass flow.  As water evaporates into the intercellular spaces or\n\nthe atmosphere, tension develop in the continuous stream of water in the\n\napoplast, hence mass flow of water occurs due to the adhesive and cohesive\n\nproperties of water.\n\nThe symplastic system is the system of interconnected protoplasts.\n\nNeighbouring cells are connected through cytoplasmic strands that\n\nextend through plasmodesmata.  During symplastic movement, the water\n\ntravels through the cells – their  cytoplasm; intercellular movement is\n\nthrough the plasmodesmata.  Water has to enter the cells through the\n\ncell membrane, hence the movement is relatively slower. Movement is again\n\ndown a potential gradient.  Symplastic movement may be aided by\n\ncytoplasmic streaming. You may have observed cytoplasmic streaming\n\nin cells of the Hydrilla leaf; the movement of chloroplast due to streaming\n\nis easily visible.\n\nMost of the water flow in the roots occurs via the apoplast since the\n\ncortical cells are loosely packed, and hence offer no resistance to water\n\nmovement.  However, the inner boundary of the cortex, the endodermis,\n\nis impervious to water because of a band of suberised  matrix called the\n\ncasparian strip.  Water molecules are unable to penetrate the layer, so\n\nthey are directed to wall regions that are not suberised, into the cells\n\nproper through the membranes. The water then moves through the\n\nsymplast and again crosses a membrane to reach the cells of the xylem.\n\nThe movement of water through the root layers is ultimately symplastic\n\nin the endodermis. This is the only\n\nway water and other solutes can\n\nenter the vascular cylinder.\n\nOnce inside the xylem, water is\n\nagain free to move between cells as\n\nwell as through them. In young\n\nroots, water enters directly into the\n\nxylem vessels and/or tracheids.\n\nThese are non-living conduits and\n\nso are parts of the apoplast.

The hyphae have a very large surface area that absorb mineral\n\nions and water from the soil from a much larger volume of soil that perhaps\n\na root cannot do. The fungus provides minerals and water to the roots, in\n\nturn the roots provide sugars and N-containing compounds to the\n\nmycorrhizae. Some plants have an obligate association with the\n\nmycorrhizae.  For example, Pinus seeds cannot germinate and establish\n\nwithout the presence of mycorrhizae.\n\n11.3.2 Water Movement up a Plant\n\nWe looked at how plants absorb water from the soil, and move it into the\n\nvascular tissues. We now have to try and understand how this water is\n\ntransported to various parts of the plant. Is the water movement active, or\n\nis it still passive? Since the water has to be moved up a stem against\n\ngravity, what provides the energy for this?\n\n11.3.2.1 Root Pressure\n\nAs various ions from the soil are actively transported into the vascular\n\ntissues of the roots, water follows (its potential gradient) and increases\n\nthe pressure inside the xylem.  This positive pressure is called root\n\npressure, and can be responsible for pushing up water to small heights\n\nin the stem.  How can we see that root pressure exists? Choose a small\n\nsoft-stemmed plant and on a day, when there is plenty of atmospheric\n\nmoisture, cut the stem horizontally near the base with a sharp blade,\n\nearly in the morning.  You will soon see drops of solution ooze out of the\n\ncut stem; this comes out due to the positive root pressure. If you fix a\n\nrubber tube to the cut stem as a sleeve you can actually collect and\n\nmeasure the rate of exudation, and also determine the composition of the\n\nexudates.  Effects of root pressure is also observable at night and early\n\nmorning when evaporation is low, and excess water collects in the form of\n\ndroplets around special openings of veins near the tip of grass blades,\n\nand leaves of many herbaceous parts.  Such water loss in its liquid phase\n\nis known as guttation.\n\nRoot pressure can, at best, only provide a modest push in the overall\n\nprocess of water transport. They obviously do not play a major role in\n\nwater movement up tall trees.  The greatest contribution of root pressure\n\nmay be to re-establish the continuous chains of water molecules in the\n\nxylem which often break under the enormous tensions created by\n\ntranspiration. Root pressure does not account for the majority of water\n\ntransport; most plants meet their need by transpiratory pull.\n\n11.3.2.2 Transpiration pull\n\nDespite the absence of a heart or a circulatory system in plants, the\n\nupward flow of water through the xylem in plants can achieve fairly high\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTRANSPORT IN PLANTS 187\n\nrates, up to 15 metres per hour. How is this movement accomplished? A\n\nlong standing question is, whether water is ‘pushed’ or ‘pulled’ through\n\nthe plant. Most researchers agree that water is mainly ‘pulled’ through\n\nthe plant, and that the driving force for this process is transpiration from\n\nthe leaves. This is referred to as the cohesion-tension-transpiration\n\npull model of water transport. But, what generates this transpirational pull?\n\nWater is transient in plants. Less than 1 per cent of the water reaching\n\nthe leaves is used in photosynthesis and plant growth. Most of it is lost\n\nthrough the stomata in the leaves. This water loss is known as\n\ntranspiration.\n\nYou have studied transpiration in an earlier class by enclosing a healthy\n\nplant in polythene bag and observing the droplets of water formed inside\n\nthe bag.  You could also study water loss from a leaf using cobalt chloride\n\npaper, which turns colour on absorbing water.\n\n11.4 TRANSPIRATION\n\nTranspiration is the evaporative loss of water by plants. It occurs mainly\n\nthrough stomata (sing. : stoma). Besides  the loss of water vapour in\n\ntranspiration, exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the leaf also occurs\n\nthrough these stomata.  Normally stomata are open in the day time and\n\nclose during the night. The immediate cause of the opening or closing of\n\nstomata is a change in the turgidity of the guard cells. The inner wall of\n\neach guard cell, towards the pore or stomatal aperture, is thick and elastic.\n\nWhen turgidity increases within the two guard cells flanking each stomatal\n\naperture or pore, the thin outer walls bulge out and force the inner walls\n\ninto a crescent shape. The opening of the stoma is also aided due to the\n\norientation of the microfibrils in the cell walls of the guard cells. Cellulose\n\nmicrofibrils are oriented radially rather than longitudinally making it easier\n\nfor the stoma to open.  When the guard cells lose turgor, due to water loss\n\n(or water stress) the elastic inner walls regain their original shape, the guard\n\ncells become flaccid and the stoma closes.\n\nUsually the lower surface of a dorsiventral (often dicotyledonous) leaf\n\nhas a greater number of stomata while in\n\nan isobilateral (often monocotyledonous)\n\nleaf they are about equal on both surfaces.\n\nTranspiration is affected by several\n\nexternal factors: temperature, light,\n\nhumidity, wind speed. Plant factors that\n\naffect transpiration include number and\n\ndistribution of stomata, per cent of open\n\nstomata, water status of the plant, canopy\n\nstructure etc.\nFigure11.8  A stomatal aperture with guard cells\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n188 BIOLOGY\n\nThe transpiration driven ascent of xylem sap depends mainly on the\n\nfollowing physical properties of water:\n\n• Cohesion – mutual attraction between water molecules.\n\n• Adhesion – attraction of water molecules to polar surfaces (such\nas the surface of tracheary elements).\n\n• Surface Tension – water molecules are attracted to each other in\nthe liquid phase more than to water in the gas phase.\n\nThese properties give water high tensile strength, i.e., an ability to\n\nresist a pulling force, and high capillarity, i.e., the ability to rise in thin\n\ntubes. In plants capillarity is aided by the small diameter of the tracheary\n\nelements – the tracheids and vessel elements.\n\nThe process of photosynthesis requires water. The system of xylem\n\nvessels from the root to the leaf vein can supply the needed water.  But\n\nwhat force does a plant use to move water molecules into the leaf\n\nparenchyma cells where they are needed? As water evaporates through\n\nthe stomata, since the thin film of water over the cells is continuous, it\n\nresults in pulling of  water, molecule by molecule, into the leaf from the\n\nxylem. Also, because of lower concentration of water vapour in the\n\natmosphere as compared to the substomatal cavity and intercellular\n\nspaces, water diffuses into the surrounding air. This creates a ‘pull’\n\n(Figure 11.9).\n\nMeasurements reveal that the forces generated by transpiration can\n\ncreate pressures sufficient to lift a xylem sized column of water over 130\n\nmetres high.\n\nXylem\n\nPhloem\n\nDiffusion into\nsurrounding air\n\nStoma\nGuard Cell\n\nPalisade\n\nFigure11.9 Water movement in the leaf. Evaporation from the leaf sets up\na pressure gradient between the outside air and the air spaces of the\nleaf. The gradient is transmitted into the photosynthetic cells and on\nthe water-filled xylem in the leaf vein.\n\nStomatal\npore\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTRANSPORT IN PLANTS 189\n\n11.4.1 Transpiration and Photosynthesis – a Compromise\n\nTranspiration has more than one purpose; it\n\n• creates transpiration pull for absorption and transport of plants\n\n• supplies water for photosynthesis\n\n• transports minerals from the soil to all parts of the plant\n\n• cools leaf surfaces, sometimes 10 to 15 degrees, by evaporative\ncooling\n\n• maintains the shape and structure of the plants by keeping cells\nturgid\n\nAn actively photosynthesising plant has an insatiable need for water.\n\nPhotosynthesis is limited by available water which can be swiftly depleted\n\nby transpiration. The humidity of rainforests is largely due to this vast\n\ncycling of water from root to leaf to atmosphere and back to the soil.\n\nThe evolution of the C\n4 \nphotosynthetic system is probably one of the\n\nstrategies for maximising the availability of CO\n2\n while minimising water\n\nloss.  C\n4\n plants are twice as efficient as C\n\n3\n plants in terms of fixing carbon\n\ndioxide (making sugar). However, a C\n4\n plant loses only half as much water\n\nas a C\n3\n plant for the same amount of CO\n\n2\n fixed.\n\n11.5 UPTAKE AND TRANSPORT OF MINERAL NUTRIENTS\n\nPlants obtain their carbon and most of their oxygen from CO\n2\n in the\n\natmosphere. However, their remaining nutritional requirements are\n\nobtained from water and minerals in the soil.\n\n11.5.1 Uptake of Mineral Ions\n\nUnlike water, all minerals cannot be passively absorbed by the roots.\n\nTwo factors account for this: (i) minerals are present in the soil as charged\n\nparticles (ions) which cannot move across cell membranes and (ii) the\n\nconcentration of minerals in the soil is usually lower than the concentration\n\nof minerals in the root. Therefore, most minerals must enter the root by\n\nactive absorption into the cytoplasm of epidermal cells. This needs energy\n\nin the form of ATP. The active uptake of ions is partly responsible for the\n\nwater potential gradient in roots, and therefore for the uptake of water by\n\nosmosis. Some ions also move into the epidermal cells passively.\n\nIons are absorbed from the soil by both passive and active transport.\n\nSpecific proteins in the membranes of root hair cells actively pump ions\n\nfrom the soil into the cytoplasms of the epidermal cells. Like all cells, the\n\nendodermal cells have many transport proteins embedded in their plasma\n\nmembrane; they let some solutes cross the membrane, but not others.\n\nTransport proteins of endodermal cells are control points, where a plant\n\nadjusts the quantity and types of solutes that reach the xylem. Note\n\nthat the root endodermis because of the layer of suberin has the ability to\n\nactively transport ions in one direction only.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n190 BIOLOGY\n\n11.5.2 Translocation of Mineral Ions\n\nAfter the ions have reached xylem through active or passive uptake, or a\n\ncombination of the two, their further transport up the stem to all parts of\n\nthe plant is through the transpiration stream.\n\nThe chief sinks for the mineral elements are the growing regions of the\n\nplant, such as the apical and lateral meristems, young leaves, developing\n\nflowers, fruits and seeds, and the storage organs.  Unloading of mineral\n\nions occurs at the fine vein endings through diffusion and active uptake\n\nby these cells.\n\nMineral ions are frequently remobilised, particularly from older,\n\nsenescing parts.  Older dying leaves export much of their mineral content\n\nto younger leaves.  Similarly, before leaf fall in decidous plants, minerals\n\nare removed to other parts. Elements most readily mobilised are\n\nphosphorus, sulphur, nitrogen and potassium.  Some elements that are\n\nstructural components like calcium are not remobilised.\n\nAn analysis of the xylem exudates shows that though some of the\n\nnitrogen travels as inorganic ions, much of it is carried in the organic\n\nform as amino acids and related compounds. Similarly, small amounts\n\nof P and S are carried as organic compounds.  In addition, small amount\n\nof exchange of materials does take place between xylem and phloem.\n\nHence, it is not that we can clearly make a distinction and say categorically\n\nthat xylem transports only inorganic nutrients while phloem transports\n\nonly organic materials, as was traditionally believed.\n\n11.6   PHLOEM TRANSPORT: FLOW FROM SOURCE TO SINK\n\nFood, primarily sucrose, is transported by the vascular tissue phloem\n\nfrom a source to a sink. Usually the source is understood to be that\n\npart of the plant which synthesises the food, i.e., the leaf, and sink, the\n\npart that needs or stores the food.  But, the source and sink may be\n\nreversed depending on the season, or the plant’s needs. Sugar stored\n\nin roots may be mobilised to become a source of food in the early spring\n\nwhen the buds of trees, act as sink; they need energy for growth and\n\ndevelopment of the photosynthetic apparatus. Since the source-sink\n\nrelationship is variable, the direction of movement in the phloem can\n\nbe upwards or downwards, i.e., bi-directional. This contrasts with\n\nthat of the xylem where the movement is always unidirectional, i.e.,\n\nupwards. Hence, unlike one-way flow of water in transpiration, food\n\nin phloem sap can be transported in any required direction so long\n\nas there is a source of sugar and a sink able to use, store or remove\n\nthe sugar.\n\nPhloem sap is mainly water and sucrose, but other sugars, hormones\n\nand amino acids are also transported or translocated through phloem.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTRANSPORT IN PLANTS 191\n\n11.6.1 The Pressure Flow or Mass Flow Hypothesis\n\nThe accepted mechanism used for the translocation of sugars from source\n\nto sink is called the pressure flow hypothesis. (see Figure 11.10). As\n\nglucose is prepared at the source (by photosynthesis) it is converted to\n\nsucrose (a dissacharide). The sugar is then moved in the form of sucrose\n\ninto the companion cells and then into the living phloem sieve tube cells\n\nby active transport. This process of loading at the source produces a\n\nhypertonic condition in the phloem. Water in the adjacent xylem moves\n\ninto the phloem by osmosis. As osmotic pressure builds up the phloem\n\nsap will move to areas of lower pressure.  At the sink osmotic pressure\n\nmust be reduced. Again active transport is necessary to move the sucrose\n\nout of the phloem sap and into the cells which will use the sugar –\n\nconverting it into energy, starch, or cellulose. As sugars are removed, the\n\nosmotic pressure decreases and water moves out of the phloem.\n\nTo summarise, the movement of sugars in the phloem begins at the\n\nsource, where sugars are loaded (actively transported) into a sieve tube.\n\nLoading of the phloem sets up a water potential gradient that facilitates\n\nthe mass movement in the phloem.\n\nPhloem tissue is composed of sieve tube cells, which form long columns\n\nwith holes in their end walls called sieve plates. Cytoplasmic strands pass\n\nthrough the holes in the sieve plates, so forming continuous filaments. As\n\nhydrostatic pressure in the sieve tube of phloem increases, pressure flow\n\nbegins, and the sap moves through the phloem. Meanwhile, at the sink,\n\nincoming sugars are actively transported out of the phloem and removed\n\nSugars leave sieve tube\nfor metabolism and\n\nstorage; water follows\nby osmosis\n\n=High\n\nPhloem\n\nturgor\npressure\n\nRoot\n\nSugars enter sieve tubes;\nwater follows by osmosis\n\nSugar solution flows\nto regions of low\nturgor pressure\n\nTip of stem\n\nSugars leave sieve tubes;\nwater follows by osmosis\n\nFigure11.10 Diagrammatic presentation of mechanism of translocation\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n192 BIOLOGY\n\nas complex carbohydrates. The loss of solute produces a high water\n\npotential in the phloem, and water passes out, returning eventually to xylem.\n\nA simple experiment, called girdling, was used to identify the tissues\n\nthrough which food is transported. On the trunk of a tree a ring of bark\n\nup to a depth of the phloem layer, can be carefully removed.  In the absence\n\nof downward movement of food the portion of the bark  above the ring on\n\nthe stem becomes swollen after a few weeks.  This simple experiment\n\nshows that phloem is the tissue responsible for translocation of food; and\n\nthat transport takes place in one direction, i.e., towards the roots. This\n\nexperiment can be performed by you easily.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nPlants obtain a variety of inorganic elements (ions) and salts from their\n\nsurroundings especially from water and soil. The movement of these nutrients\n\nfrom environment into the plant as well as from one plant cell to another plant cell\n\nessentially involves movement across a cell membrane. Transport across cell\n\nmembrane can be through diffusion, facilitated transport or active transport. Water\n\nand minerals absorbed by roots are transported by xylem and the organic material\n\nsynthesised in the leaves is transported to other parts of plant through phloem.\n\nPassive transport (diffusion, osmosis) and active transport are the two modes\n\nof nutrient transport across cell membranes in living organisms. In passive\n\ntransport,  nutrients move across the membrane by diffusion, without any use of\n\nenergy as it is always down the concentration gradient and hence entropy driven.\n\nThis diffusion of substances depends on their size, solubility in water or organic\n\nsolvents. Osmosis is the special type of diffusion of water across a selectively\n\npermeable membrane which depends on pressure gradient and concentration\n\ngradient. In active transport, energy in the form of ATP is utilised to pump\n\nmolecules against a concentration gradient across membranes. Water potential is\n\nthe potential energy of water molecules which helps in the movement of water. It is\n\ndetermined by solute potential and pressure potential. The osmotic behaviour of\n\ncells depends on the surrounding solution. If the surrounding solution of the cell\n\nis hypertonic, it gets plasmolysed. The absorption of water by seeds and drywood\n\ntakes place by a special type of diffusion called imbibition.\n\nIn higher plants, there is a vascular system comprising of xylem and phloem,\n\nresponsible for translocation. Water minerals and food cannot be moved within\n\nthe body of a plant by diffusion alone. They are therefore, transported by a mass\n\nflow system – movement of substance in bulk from one point to another as a\n\nresult of pressure differences between the two points.\n\nWater absorbed by root hairs moves into the root tissue by two distinct\n\npathways, i.e., apoplast and symplast. Various ions, and water from soil can be\n\ntransported upto a small height in stems by root pressure. Transpiration pull\n\nmodel is the most acceptable to explain the transport of water. Transpiration is\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nTRANSPORT IN PLANTS 193\n\nthe loss of water in the form of vapours from the plant parts through stomata.\n\nTemperature, light, humidity, wind speed and number of stomata affect the rate\n\nof transpiration. Excess water is also removed through tips of leaves of plants by\n\nguttation.\n\nPhloem is responsible for transport of food (primarily) sucrose from the source\n\nto the sink. The translocation in phloem is bi-directional; the source-sink\n\nrelationship is variable. The translocation in phloem is explained by the pressure-\n\nflow hypothesis.\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1.

They\n\nrequire macromolecules, such as carbohydrates, proteins and fats, and\n\nwater and minerals for their growth and development.\n\nThis chapter focusses mainly on inorganic plant nutrition, wherein\n\nyou will study the methods to identify elements essential to growth and\n\ndevelopment of plants and the criteria for establishing the essentiality.\n\nYou will also study the role of the essential elements, their major deficiency\n\nsymptoms and the mechanism of absorption of these essential elements.\n\nThe chapter also introduces you briefly to the significance and the\n\nmechanism of biological nitrogen fixation.\n\n12.1 METHODS TO STUDY THE MINERAL REQUIREMENTS OF PLANTS\n\nIn 1860, Julius von Sachs, a prominent German botanist, demonstrated,\n\nfor the first time, that plants could be grown to maturity in a defined\n\nnutrient solution in complete absence of soil. This technique of growing\n\nplants in a nutrient solution is known as hydroponics. Since then, a\n\nnumber of improvised methods have been employed to try and determine\n\nthe mineral nutrients essential for plants. The essence of all these methods\n\ninvolves the culture of plants in a soil-free, defined mineral solution. These\n\nmethods require purified water and mineral nutrient salts. Can you\n\nexplain why is this so essential?\n\nAfter a series of experiments in which the roots of the plants were\n\nimmersed in nutrient solutions and wherein an element was added /\n\nsubstituted / removed or given in varied concentration, a mineral solution\n\nMINERAL NUTRITION\n\nCHAPTER  12\n\n12.1 Methods to\n\nStudy the\n\nMineral\n\nRequirements of\n\nPlants\n\n12.2 Essential\n\nMineral\n\nElements\n\n12.3 Mechanism of\n\nAbsorption of\n\nElements\n\n12.4 Translocation of\n\nSolutes\n\n12.5 Soil as Reservoir\n\nof Essential\n\nElements\n\n12.6 Metabolism of\n\nNitrogen\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMINERAL NUTRITION 195\n\nsuitable for the plant growth was obtained. By this\n\nmethod, essential elements were identified and\n\ntheir deficiency symptoms discovered. Hydroponics\n\nhas been successfully employed as a technique for\n\nthe commercial production of vegetables such as\n\ntomato, seedless cucumber and lettuce. It must be\n\nemphasised that the nutrient solutions must be\n\nadequately aerated to obtain the optimum growth.\n\nWhat would happen if solutions were poorly\n\naerated? Diagrammatic views of the hydroponic\n\ntechnique is given in Figures 12.1 and 12.2.\n\n12.2 ESSENTIAL MINERAL ELEMENTS\n\nMost of the minerals present in soil can enter plants\n\nthrough roots. In fact, more than sixty elements of\n\nthe 105 discovered so far are found in different\n\nplants. Some plant species accumulate selenium,\n\nsome others gold, while some plants growing near\n\nnuclear test sites take up radioactive strontium.\n\nThere are techniques that are able to detect the\n\nminerals even at a very low concentration (10-8 g/\n\nmL). The question is, whether all the diverse mineral\n\nelements present in a plant, for example, gold and\n\nselenium as mentioned above, are really necessary\n\nfor plants? How do we decide what is essential for\n\nplants and what is not?\n\n12.2.1 Criteria for Essentiality\n\nThe criteria for essentiality of an element are given\n\nbelow:\n\n(a) The element must be absolutely necessary for\n\nsupporting normal growth and reproduction.\n\nIn the absence of the element the plants do not\n\ncomplete their life cycle or set the seeds.\n\n(b) The requirement of the element must be specific\n\nand not replaceable by another element. In\n\nother words, deficiency of any one element\n\ncannot be met by supplying some other\n\nelement.\n\n(c) The element must be directly involved in the\n\nmetabolism of the plant.\n\nFigure 12.1  Diagram of a typical set-up for\nnutrient solution culture\n\nFigure 12.2 Hydroponic plant production.\nPlants are grown in a tube or\ntrough placed on a slight\nincline. A pump circulates a\nnutrient solution from a\nreservoir to the elevated end of\nthe tube. The solution flows\ndown the tube and returns to\nthe reservoir due to gravity.\nInset shows a plant whose\nroots are continuously bathed\nin aerated nutrient solution.\nThe arrows indicates the\ndirection of the flow.\n\nNutrient\nsolution Pump\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n196 BIOLOGY\n\nBased upon the above criteria only a few elements have been found to\n\nbe absolutely essential for plant growth and metabolism. These elements\n\nare further divided into two broad categories based on their quantitative\n\nrequirements.\n\n(i) Macronutrients, and\n\n(ii) Micronutrients\n\nMacronutrients are generally present in plant tissues in large amounts\n\n(in excess of 10 mmole Kg –1 of dry matter). The macronutrients include\n\ncarbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorous, sulphur, potassium,\n\ncalcium and magnesium. Of these, carbon, hydrogen and oxygen are\n\nmainly obtained from CO\n2\n and H\n\n2\nO, while the others are absorbed from\n\nthe soil as mineral nutrition.\n\nMicronutrients or trace elements, are needed in very small amounts\n\n(less than 10 mmole Kg –1 of dry matter). These include iron, manganese,\n\ncopper, molybdenum, zinc, boron, chlorine and nickel.\n\nIn addition to the 17 essential elements named above, there are some\n\nbeneficial elements such as sodium, silicon, cobalt and selenium. They\n\nare required by higher plants.\n\nEssential elements can also be grouped into four broad categories on\n\nthe basis of their diverse functions. These categories are:\n\n(i) Essential elements as components of biomolecules and hence\n\nstructural elements of cells (e.g., carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and\n\nnitrogen).\n\n(ii) Essential elements that are components of energy-related chemical\n\ncompounds in plants (e.g., magnesium in chlorophyll and\n\nphosphorous in ATP).\n\n(iii) Essential elements that activate or inhibit enzymes, for example\n\nMg2+ is an activator for both ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-\n\noxygenase and phosphoenol pyruvate carboxylase, both of which\n\nare critical enzymes in photosynthetic carbon fixation; Zn2+ is an\n\nactivator of alcohol dehydrogenase and Mo of nitrogenase during\n\nnitrogen metabolism. Can you name a few more elements that\n\nfall in this category? For this, you will need to recollect some of\n\nthe biochemical pathways you have studied earlier.\n\n(iv) Some essential elements can alter the osmotic potential of a cell.\n\nPotassium plays an important role in the opening and closing of\n\nstomata. You may recall the role of minerals as solutes in\n\ndetermining the water potential of a cell.\n\n12.2.2 Role of Macro- and Micro-nutrients\n\nEssential elements perform several functions. They participate in various\n\nmetabolic processes in the plant cells such as permeability of cell\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMINERAL NUTRITION 197\n\nmembrane, maintenance of osmotic concentration of cell sap, electron-\n\ntransport systems, buffering action, enzymatic activity and act as major\n\nconstituents of macromolecules and co-enzymes.\n\nVarious forms and functions of essential nutrient elements are given\n\nbelow.\n\nNitrogen: This is the essential nutrient element required by plants in the\n\ngreatest amount. It is absorbed mainly as NO\n3\n–  though some are also taken\n\nup as NO\n2\n–  or NH\n\n4\n+. Nitrogen is required by all parts of a plant, particularly\n\nthe meristematic tissues and the metabolically active cells. Nitrogen is one of\n\nthe major constituents of proteins, nucleic acids, vitamins and hormones.\n\nPhosphorus: Phosphorus is absorbed by the plants from soil in the form\n\nof phosphate ions (either as H PO2 4\n−  or HPO4\n\n2− ). Phosphorus is a\n\nconstituent of cell membranes, certain proteins, all nucleic acids and\n\nnucleotides, and is required for all phosphorylation reactions.\n\nPotassium: It is absorbed as potassium ion (K+). In plants, this is required\n\nin more abundant quantities in the meristematic tissues, buds, leaves\n\nand root tips. Potassium helps to maintain an anion-cation balance in\n\ncells and is involved in protein synthesis, opening and closing of stomata,\n\nactivation of enzymes and in the maintenance of the turgidity of cells.\n\nCalcium: Plant absorbs calcium from the soil in the form of calcium ions\n\n(Ca2+). Calcium is required by meristematic and differentiating tissues.\n\nDuring cell division it is used in the synthesis of cell wall, particularly as\n\ncalcium pectate in the middle lamella. It is also needed during the\n\nformation of mitotic spindle. It accumulates in older leaves. It is involved\n\nin the normal functioning of the cell membranes. It activates certain\n\nenzymes and plays an important role in regulating metabolic activities.\n\nMagnesium: It is absorbed by plants in the form of divalent Mg2+. It\n\nactivates the enzymes of respiration, photosynthesis and are involved in\n\nthe synthesis of DNA and RNA. Magnesium is a constituent of the ring\n\nstructure of chlorophyll and helps to maintain the ribosome structure.\n\nSulphur: Plants obtain sulphur in the form of sulphate ( )SO4\n2− . Sulphur is\n\npresent in two amino acids – cysteine and methionine and is the main\n\nconstituent of several coenzymes, vitamins (thiamine, biotin, Coenzyme A)\n\nand ferredoxin.\n\nIron: Plants obtain iron in the form of ferric ions (Fe3+). It is required in\n\nlarger amounts in comparison to other micronutrients. It is an important\n\nconstituent of proteins involved in the transfer of electrons like ferredoxin\n\nand cytochromes. It is reversibly oxidised from Fe2+ to Fe3+ during electron\n\ntransfer. It activates catalase enzyme, and is essential for the formation of\n\nchlorophyll.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n198 BIOLOGY\n\nManganese: It is absorbed in the form of manganous ions (Mn2+). It\n\nactivates many enzymes involved in photosynthesis, respiration and\n\nnitrogen metabolism. The best defined function of manganese is in the\n\nsplitting of water to liberate oxygen during photosynthesis.\n\nZinc: Plants obtain zinc as Zn2+ ions. It activates various enzymes,\n\nespecially carboxylases. It is also needed in the synthesis of auxin.\n\nCopper: It is absorbed as cupric ions (Cu2+). It is essential for the overall\n\nmetabolism in plants. Like iron, it is associated with certain enzymes\n\ninvolved in redox reactions and is reversibly oxidised from Cu+ to Cu2+.\n\nBoron : It is absorbed as BO3\n3−  or B O4 7\n\n2− . Boron is required for uptake\n\nand utilisation of Ca2+, membrane functioning, pollen germination, cell\n\nelongation, cell differentiation and carbohydrate translocation.\n\nMolybdenum: Plants obtain it in the form of molybdate ions ( )MoO\n2\n2+ . It\n\nis a component of several enzymes, including nitrogenase and nitrate\n\nreductase both of which participate in nitrogen metabolism.\n\nChlorine: It is absorbed in the form of chloride anion (Cl–). Along with\n\nNa+ and K+, it helps in determining the solute concentration and the anion-\n\ncation balance in cells. It is essential for the water-splitting reaction in\n\nphotosynthesis, a reaction that leads to oxygen evolution.\n\n12.2.3 Deficiency Symptoms of Essential Elements\n\nWhenever the supply of an essential element becomes limited, plant growth\n\nis retarded. The concentration of the essential element below which plant\n\ngrowth is retarded is termed as critical concentration. The element is\n\nsaid to be deficient when present below the critical concentration.\n\nSince each element has one or more specific structural or functional\n\nrole in plants, in the absence of any particular element, plants show certain\n\nmorphological changes. These morphological changes are indicative of\n\ncertain element deficiencies and are called deficiency symptoms. The\n\ndeficiency symptoms vary from element to element and they disappear\n\nwhen the deficient mineral nutrient is provided to the plant. However, if\n\ndeprivation continues, it may eventually lead to the death of the plant. The\n\nparts of the plants that show the deficiency symptoms also depend on the\n\nmobility of the element in the plant. For elements that are actively mobilised\n\nwithin the plants and exported to young developing tissues, the deficiency\n\nsymptoms tend to appear first in the older tissues. For example, the\n\ndeficiency symptoms of nitrogen, potassium and magnesium are visible\n\nfirst in the senescent leaves. In the older leaves, biomolecules containing\n\nthese elements are broken down, making these elements available for\n\nmobilising to younger leaves.\n\nThe deficiency symptoms tend to appear first in the young tissues\n\nwhenever the elements are relatively immobile and are not transported\n\nout of the mature organs, for example, element like sulphur and\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMINERAL NUTRITION 199\n\ncalcium are a part of the structural component of the cell and hence are\n\nnot easily released. This aspect of mineral nutrition of plants is of a great\n\nsignificance and importance to agriculture and horticulture.\n\nThe kind of deficiency symptoms shown in plants include chlorosis,\n\nnecrosis, stunted plant growth, premature fall of leaves and buds, and\n\ninhibition of cell division. Chlorosis is the loss of chlorophyll leading to\n\nyellowing in leaves. This symptom is caused by the deficiency of elements\n\nN, K, Mg, S, Fe, Mn, Zn and Mo. Likewise, necrosis, or death of tissue,\n\nparticularly leaf tissue, is due to the deficiency of Ca, Mg, Cu, K. Lack or\n\nlow level of N, K, S, Mo causes an inhibition of cell division. Some elements\n\nlike N, S, Mo delay flowering if their concentration in plants is low.\n\nYou can see from the above that the deficiency of any element can\n\ncause multiple symptoms and that the same symptoms may be caused\n\nby the deficiency of one of several different elements. Hence, to identify\n\nthe deficient element, one has to study all the symptoms developed in all\n\nthe various parts of the plant and compare them with the available\n\nstandard tables. We must also be aware that different plants also respond\n\ndifferently to the deficiency of the same element.\n\n12.2.4 Toxicity of Micronutrients\n\nThe requirement of micronutrients is always in low amounts while their\n\nmoderate decrease causes the deficiency symptoms and a moderate increase\n\ncauses toxicity. In other words, there is a narrow range of concentration at\n\nwhich the elements are optimum. Any mineral ion concentration in tissues\n\nthat reduces the dry weight of tissues by about 10 per cent is considered\n\ntoxic. Such critical concentrations vary widely among different\n\nmicronutrients. The toxicity symptoms are difficult to identify. Toxicity levels\n\nfor any element also vary for different plants. Many a times, excess of an\n\nelement may inhibit the uptake of another element. For example, the\n\nprominent symptom of manganese toxicity is the appearance of brown\n\nspots surrounded by chlorotic veins. It is important to know that\n\nmanganese competes with iron and magnesium for uptake and with\n\nmagnesium for binding with enzymes. Manganese also inhibit calcium\n\ntranslocation in shoot apex. Therefore, excess of manganese may, in fact,\n\ninduce deficiencies of iron, magnesium and calcium. Thus, what appears\n\nas symptoms of manganese toxicity may actually be the deficiency\n\nsymptoms of iron, magnesium and calcium. Can this knowledge be of some\n\nimportance to a farmer? a gardener? or even for you in your kitchen-garden?\n\n12.3 MECHANISM OF ABSORPTION OF ELEMENTS\n\nMuch of the studies on mechanism of absorption of elements by plants\n\nhas been carried out in isolated cells, tissues or organs. These studies\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n200 BIOLOGY\n\nrevealed that the process of absorption can be demarcated into two main\n\nphases. In the first phase, an initial rapid uptake of ions into the ‘free\n\nspace’ or ‘outer space’ of cells – the apoplast, is passive. In the second\n\nphase of uptake, the ions are taken in slowly into the ‘inner space’ –  the\n\nsymplast of the cells. The passive movement of ions into the apoplast\n\nusually occurs through ion-channels, the trans-membrane proteins that\n\nfunction as selective pores. On the other hand, the entry or exit of ions to\n\nand from the symplast requires the expenditure of metabolic energy, which\n\nis an active process. The movement of ions is usually called flux; the\n\ninward movement into the cells is influx and the outward movement, efflux.\n\nYou have read the aspects of mineral nutrient uptake and translocation\n\nin plants in Chapter 11.\n\n12.4 TRANSLOCATION OF SOLUTES\n\nMineral salts are translocated through xylem along with the ascending\n\nstream of water, which is pulled up through the plant by transpirational\n\npull. Analysis of xylem sap shows the presence of mineral salts in it. Use\n\nof radioisotopes of mineral elements also substantiate the view that they\n\nare transported through the xylem. You have already discussed the\n\nmovement of water in xylem in Chapter 11.\n\n12.5 SOIL AS RESERVOIR OF ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS\n\nMajority of the nutrients that are essential for the growth and\n\ndevelopment of plants become available to the roots due to weathering\n\nand breakdown of rocks. These processes enrich the soil with dissolved\n\nions and inorganic salts. Since they are derived from the rock minerals,\n\ntheir role in plant nutrition is referred to as mineral nutrition. Soil\n\nconsists of a wide variety of substances. Soil not only supplies minerals\n\nbut also harbours nitrogen-fixing bacteria, other microbes, holds water,\n\nsupplies air to the roots and acts as a matrix that stabilises the plant.\n\nSince deficiency of essential minerals affect the crop-yield, there is often\n\na need for supplying them through fertilisers. Both macro-nutrients\n\n(N, P, K, S, etc.) and micro-nutrients (Cu, Zn, Fe, Mn, etc.) form\n\ncomponents of fertilisers and are applied as per need.\n\n12.6 METABOLISM OF NITROGEN\n\n12.6.1 Nitrogen Cycle\n\nApart from carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, nitrogen is the most\n\nprevalent element in living organisms. Nitrogen is a constituent of\n\namino acids, proteins, hormones, chlorophylls and many of the\n\nvitamins. Plants compete with microbes for the limited nitrogen that\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMINERAL NUTRITION 201\n\nis available in soil. Thus, nitrogen is\n\na limiting nutrient for both natural\n\nand agricultural eco-systems.\n\nNitrogen exists as two nitrogen atoms\n\njoined by a very strong triple covalent\n\nbond (N ≡ N).  The process of\n\nconversion of  nitrogen (N\n2\n)  to\n\nammonia is termed as nitrogen-\n\nfixation. In nature, lightning and\n\nultraviolet radiation provide enough\n\nenergy to convert nitrogen to nitrogen\n\noxides (NO, NO\n2\n, N\n\n2\nO). Industrial\n\ncombustions, forest fires, automobile\n\nexhausts and power -generating\n\nstations are also sources of\n\natmospheric nitrogen oxides.\n\nDecomposition of organic nitrogen of\n\ndead plants and animals into\n\nammonia is called ammonification.\n\nSome of this ammonia volatilises and\n\nre-enters the atmosphere but most of\n\nit is converted into nitrate by soil\n\nbacteria in the following steps:\n\nFigure 12.3 The nitrogen cycle showing\nrelationship between the three\nmain nitrogen pools – atmospheric\nsoil, and biomass\n\n2 3 2 2 23 2 2 2NH O NO H H O+ \uf8e7 →\uf8e7 + +\n− + .... (i)\n\n2 22 2 3NO O NO\n− −\n\n+ \uf8e7 →\uf8e7 ...... (ii)\n\nAmmonia is first oxidised to nitrite by the bacteria Nitrosomonas and/or\n\nNitrococcus. The nitrite is further oxidised to nitrate with the help of the\n\nbacterium Nitrobacter. These steps are called nitrification (Figure 12.3).\n\nThese nitrifying bacteria are chemoautotrophs.\n\nThe nitrate thus formed is absorbed by plants and is transported to\n\nthe leaves. In leaves, it is reduced to form ammonia that finally forms the\n\namine group of amino acids. Nitrate present in the soil is also reduced to\n\nnitrogen by the process of denitrification. Denitrification is carried by\n\nbacteria Pseudomonas and Thiobacillus.\n\n12.6.2 Biological Nitrogen Fixation\n\nVery few living organisms can utilise the nitrogen in the form N\n2\n,\n \navailable\n\nabundantly in the air. Only certain prokaryotic species are capable of\n\nfixing nitrogen. Reduction of nitrogen to ammonia by living organisms is\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n202 BIOLOGY\n\ncalled biological nitrogen fixation. The enzyme, nitrogenase which is\n\ncapable of nitrogen reduction is present exclusively in prokaryotes. Such\n\nmicrobes are called N\n2\n- fixers.\n\nN N NH\nNitrogenase\n\n≡ \uf8e7 →\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7 3\n\nThe nitrogen-fixing microbes could be free-living or symbiotic. Examples\n\nof free-living nitrogen-fixing aerobic microbes are Azotobacter and\n\nBeijerinckia while Rhodospirillum is anaerobic and free-living. In addition,\n\na number of cyanobacteria such as Anabaena and Nostoc are also free-\n\nliving nitrogen-fixers.\n\nSymbiotic biological nitrogen fixation\n\nSeveral types of symbiotic biological nitrogen fixing associations are known.\n\nThe most prominent among them is the legume-bacteria relationship.\n\nSpecies of rod-shaped Rhizobium has such relationship with the roots of\n\nseveral legumes such as alfalfa, sweet clover, sweet pea, lentils, garden pea,\n\nbroad bean, clover beans, etc.  The most common association on roots is\n\nas nodules. These nodules are small outgrowths on the roots. The microbe,\n\nFrankia, also produces nitrogen-fixing nodules on the roots of non-\n\nleguminous plants (e.g., Alnus). Both Rhizobium and Frankia are free-\n\nliving in soil, but as symbionts, can fix atmospheric nitrogen.\n\nUproot any one plant of a common pulse, just before flowering. You\n\nwill see near-spherical outgrowths on the roots. These are nodules. If\n\nyou cut through them you will notice that the central portion is red or\n\npink. What makes the nodules pink? This is due to the presence of\n\nleguminous haemoglobin or leg-haemoglobin.\n\nNodule Formation\n\nNodule formation involves a sequence of multiple interactions between\n\nRhizobium and roots of the host plant. Principal stages in the nodule\n\nformation are summarised as follows:\n\nRhizobia multiply and colonise the surroundings of roots and get attached\n\nto epidermal and root hair cells. The root-hairs curl and the bacteria invade\n\nthe root-hair. An infection thread is produced carrying the bacteria into\n\nthe cortex of the root, where they initiate the nodule formation in the cortex\n\nof the root. Then the bacteria are released from the thread into the cells\n\nwhich leads to the differentiation of specialised nitrogen fixing cells. The\n\nnodule thus formed, establishes a direct vascular connection with the host\n\nfor exchange of nutrients. These events are depicted in Figure 12.4.\n\nThe nodule contains all the necessary biochemical components, such\n\nas the enzyme nitrogenase and leghaemoglobin. The enzyme nitrogenase\n\nis a Mo-Fe protein and catalyses the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen\n\nto ammonia, (Figure 12.5) the first stable product of nitrogen fixation.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMINERAL NUTRITION 203\n\nThe reaction is as follows:\n\n–\n2 3 2 iN 8e 8H 16ATP 2NH H 16ADP 16P\n\n+\n\n+ + + \uf8e7\uf8e7→ + + +\n\nThe enzyme nitrogenase is highly sensitive to the molecular oxygen; it\n\nrequires anaerobic conditions. The nodules have adaptations that ensure\n\nthat the enzyme is protected from oxygen. To protect these enzymes, the\n\nnodule contains an oxygen scavenger called leg-haemoglobin. It is interesting\n\nto note that these microbes live as aerobes under free-living conditions (where\n\nnitrogenase is not operational), but during nitrogen-fixing events, they become\n\nanaerobic (thus protecting the nitrogenase enzyme). You must have noticed\n\nin the above reaction that the ammonia synthesis by nitrogenease requires a\n\nSoil\nparticles\n\nRoot hair\n\nBacteria\n\nInner cortex and\npericycle cells\nunder division\n\nInfection\nthread\n\ncontaining\nbacteria\n\nMature nodule\n\nHook\n\nBacteria\n\nFigure 12.4 Development of root nodules in soyabean : (a) Rhizobium bacteria\ncontact a susceptible root hair, divide near it, (b) Successful infection\nof the root hair causes it to curl, (c) Infected thread carries the bacteria\nto the inner cortex.

The energy required,\n\nthus, is obtained from the  respiration of the host cells.\n\nFate of ammonia: At physiological pH, the ammonia is protonated to form\n\nNH4\n+  (ammonium) ion. While most of the plants can assimilate nitrate as well\n\nas ammonium ions, the latter is quite toxic to plants and hence cannot\n\naccumulate in them. Let us now see how the NH4\n+  is used to synthesise\n\namino acids in plants. There are two main ways in which this can take place:\n\n(i) Reductive amination : In these processes, ammonia reacts with\n\nα-ketoglutaric acid and forms glutamic acid as indicated in the\n\nequation given below :\n\n(ii) Transamination : It involves the transfer of amino group from one\n\namino acid to the keto group of a keto acid. Glutamic acid is the main\n\namino acid from which the transfer of NH\n2\n, the amino group takes\n\nplace and other amino acids are formed through transamination. The\n\nenzyme transaminase catalyses all such reactions. For example,\n\nα − + + \uf8e7 →\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\n+\n\nketoglutaric acid NH NADPH\nGlutamate\n\nDehydrogenase4\n\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7 + +glutamate H O NADP2\n\nThe two most important amides – asparagine and glutamine – found in\n\nplants are a structural part of proteins. They are formed from two amino\n\nacids, namely aspartic acid and glutamic acid, respectively, by addition\n\nof another amino group to each. The hydroxyl part of the acid is replaced\n\nby another NH\n2\n– radicle. Since amides contain more nitrogen than the\n\namino acids, they are transported to other parts of the plant via xylem\n\nvessels. In addition, along  with the transpiration stream the nodules of\n\nsome plants (e.g., soyabean) export the fixed nitrogen as ureides. These\n\ncompounds also have a particularly high nitrogen to carbon ratio.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nPlants obtain their inorganic nutrients from air, water and soil. Plants absorb a\n\nwide variety of mineral elements. Not all the mineral elements that they absorb are\n\nrequired by plants. Out of the more than 105 elements discovered so far, less than\n\n21 are essential and beneficial for normal plant growth and development. The\n\nelements required in large quantities are called macronutrients while those required\n\nin less quantities or in trace are termed as micronutrients. These elements are\n\neither essential constituents of proteins, carbohydrates, fats, nucleic acid etc.,\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nMINERAL NUTRITION 205\n\nand/or take part in various metabolic processes. Deficiency of each of these\n\nessential elements may lead to symptoms called deficiency symptoms. Chlorosis,\n\nnecrosis, stunted growth, impaired cell division, etc., are some prominent deficiency\n\nsymptoms. Plants absorb minerals through roots by either passive or active\n\nprocesses. They are carried to all parts of the organism through xylem along with\n\nwater transport.\n\nNitrogen is very essential for the sustenance of life. Plants cannot use\n\natmospheric nitrogen directly. But some of the plants in association with N\n2\n-fixing\n\nbacteria, especially roots of legumes, can fix this atmospheric nitrogen into\n\nbiologically usable forms. Nitrogen fixation requires a strong reducing agent and\n\nenergy in the form of ATP. N\n2\n -fixation is accomplished with the help of nitrogen-\n\nfixing microbes, mainly Rhizobium. The enzyme nitrogenase which plays an\n\nimportant role in biological N\n2\n  fixation is very sensitive to oxygen. Most of the\n\nprocesses take place in anaerobic environment. The energy, ATP, required is\n\nprovided by the respiration of the host cells. Ammonia produced following N\n2\n  fixation\n\nis incorporated into amino acids as the amino group.\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1. ‘All elements that are present in a plant need not be essential to its survival’.\n\nComment.\n\n2.

Have\n\nyou ever wondered from where plants get their food?  Green plants, in fact,\n\nhave to make or rather synthesise the food they need and all other organisms\n\ndepend on them for their needs. The green plants make or rather synthesise\n\nthe food they need through photosynthesis and are therefore called autotrophs.\n\nYou have already learnt that the autotrophic nutrition is found only in plants\n\nand all other organisms that depend on the green plants for food are\n\nheterotrophs. Green plants carry out ‘photosynthesis’, a physico-chemical\n\nprocess by which they use light energy to drive the synthesis of organic\n\ncompounds.  Ultimately, all living forms on earth depend on sunlight for\n\nenergy.  The use of energy from sunlight by plants doing photosynthesis is\n\nthe basis of life on earth.  Photosynthesis is important due to two reasons: it\n\nis the primary source of all food on earth. It is also responsible for the release\n\nof oxygen into the atmosphere by green plants. Have you ever thought what\n\nwould happen if there were no oxygen to breath? This chapter focusses on\n\nthe structure of the photosynthetic machinery and the various reactions\n\nthat transform light energy into chemical energy.\n\n13.1 WHAT DO WE KNOW?\n\nLet us try to find out what we already know about photosynthesis.  Some\n\nsimple experiments you may have done in the earlier classes have shown\n\nthat chlorophyll (green pigment of the leaf), light and CO\n2\n are required for\n\nphotosynthesis to occur.\n\nYou may have carried out the experiment to look for starch formation\n\nin two leaves – a variegated leaf or a leaf that was partially covered with\n\nblack paper, and exposed to light.  On testing these leaves for the presence\n\nof starch it was clear that photosynthesis occurred only in the green parts\n\nof the leaves in the presence of light.\n\nPHOTOSYNTHESIS IN HIGHER PLANTS\n\nCHAPTER  13\n\n13.1 What do we\n\nKnow?\n\n13.2 Early\n\nExperiments\n\n13.3 Where does\n\nPhotosynthesis\n\ntake place?\n\n13.4 How many\n\nPigments are\n\ninvolved in\n\nPhotosynthesis?\n\n13.5 What is Light\n\nReaction?\n\n13.6 The Electron\n\nTransport\n\n13.7 Where are the\n\nATP and NADPH\n\nUsed?\n\n13.8  The C\n4\n Pathway\n\n13.9 Photorespiration\n\n13.10 Factors\n\naffecting\n\nPhotosynthesis\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHOTOSYNTHESIS IN HIGHER PLANTS 207\n\nAnother experiment you may have carried out\n\nwhere a part of a leaf is enclosed in a test tube\n\ncontaining some KOH soaked cotton (which\n\nabsorbs CO\n2\n), while the other half is exposed to air.\n\nThe setup is then placed in light for some time. On\n\ntesting for the presence of starch later in the two\n\nparts of the leaf, you must have found that the\n\nexposed part of the leaf tested positive for starch\n\nwhile the portion that was in the tube, tested\n\nnegative. This showed that CO\n2\n was required for\n\nphotosynthesis. Can you explain how this\n\nconclusion could be drawn?\n\n13.2 EARLY EXPERIMENTS\n\nIt is interesting to learn about those simple\n\nexperiments that led to a gradual development in\n\nour understanding of photosynthesis.\n\nJoseph Priestley (1733-1804) in 1770\n\nperformed a series of experiments that revealed the\n\nessential role of air in the growth of green plants.\n\nPriestley, you may recall, discovered oxygen in\n\n1774. Priestley observed that a candle burning in\n\na closed space – a bell jar, soon gets extinguished\n\n(Figure 13.1 a, b, c, d).  Similarly, a mouse would\n\nsoon suffocate in a closed space. He concluded that\n\na burning candle or an animal that breathe the air,\n\nboth somehow, damage the air.  But when he placed a mint plant in the\n\nsame bell jar, he found that the mouse stayed alive and the candle\n\ncontinued to burn.  Priestley hypothesised as follows: Plants restore to\n\nthe air whatever breathing animals and burning candles remove.\n\nCan you imagine how Priestley would have conducted the experiment\n\nusing a candle and a plant?  Remember, he would need to rekindle the\n\ncandle to test whether it burns after a few days. How many different\n\nways can you think of to light the candle without disturbing the set-up?\n\nUsing a similar setup as the one used by Priestley, but by placing it\n\nonce in the dark and once in the sunlight, Jan Ingenhousz (1730-1799)\n\nshowed that sunlight is essential to the plant process that somehow\n\npurifies the air fouled by burning candles or breathing animals.\n\nIngenhousz in an elegant experiment with an aquatic plant showed that\n\nin bright sunlight, small bubbles were formed around the green parts\n\nwhile in the dark they did not.  Later he identified these bubbles to be of\n\noxygen.  Hence he showed that it is only the green part of the plants that\n\ncould release oxygen.\n\n(a)\n\n(c)\n\n(b)\n\n(d)\n\nFigure 13.1 Priestley’s experiment\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n208 BIOLOGY\n\nIt was not until about 1854 that Julius von Sachs provided evidence\n\nfor production of glucose when plants grow. Glucose is usually stored as\n\nstarch. His later studies showed that the green substance in plants\n\n(chlorophyll as we know it now) is located in special bodies (later called\n\nchloroplasts) within plant cells. He found that the green parts in plants is\n\nwhere glucose is made, and that the glucose is usually stored as starch.\n\nNow consider the interesting experiments done by T.W Engelmann\n\n(1843 – 1909).  Using a prism he split light into its spectral components\n\nand then illuminated a green alga, Cladophora, placed in a suspension\n\nof aerobic bacteria. The bacteria were used to detect the sites of O\n2\n\nevolution. He observed that the bacteria accumulated mainly in the region\n\nof blue and red light of the split spectrum. A first action spectrum of\n\nphotosynthesis was thus described. It resembles roughly the absorption\n\nspectra of chlorophyll a and b (discussed  in section 13.4).\n\nBy the middle of the nineteenth century the key features of plant\n\nphotosynthesis were known, namely, that plants could use light energy\n\nto make carbohydrates from CO\n2\n and water.  The empirical equation\n\nrepresenting the total process of photosynthesis for oxygen evolving\n\norganisms was then understood as:\n\nCO H O CH O O\nLight\n\n2 2 2 2+ \uf8e7 →\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7 +[ ]\n\nwhere [CH\n2\nO] represented a carbohydrate (e.g., glucose, a six-carbon\n\nsugar).\n\nA milestone contribution to the understanding of photosynthesis was\n\nthat made by a microbiologist, Cornelius van Niel (1897-1985), who,\n\nbased on his studies of purple and green bacteria, demonstrated that\n\nphotosynthesis is essentially a light-dependent reaction in which\n\nhydrogen from a suitable oxidisable compound reduces carbon dioxide\n\nto carbohydrates. This can be expressed by:\n\n2 22 2 2 2H A CO A CH O H O\nLight\n\n+ \uf8e7 →\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7 + +\n\nIn green plants H\n2\nO is the hydrogen donor and is oxidised to O\n\n2\n. Some\n\norganisms do not release O\n2 \nduring photosynthesis.  When H\n\n2\nS, instead\n\nis the hydrogen donor for purple and green sulphur bacteria, the\n\n‘oxidation’ product is sulphur or sulphate depending on the organism\n\nand not O\n2\n. Hence, he inferred that the O\n\n2 \nevolved by the green plant\n\ncomes from H\n2\nO, not from carbon dioxide. This was later proved by using\n\nradioisotopic techniques.  The correct equation, that would represent  the\n\noverall process of photosynthesis is therefore:\n\n6 12 6 62 2 6 12 6 2 2CO H O C H O H O O\nLight\n\n+ \uf8e7 →\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7 + +\n\nwhere C\n6\n H\n\n12\n O\n\n6\n represents glucose. The O\n\n2\n released is from water; this\n\nwas proved using radio isotope techniques. Note that this is not a single\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHOTOSYNTHESIS IN HIGHER PLANTS 209\n\nreaction but description of a multistep process called photosynthesis.\n\nCan you explain why twelve molecules of water as substrate are used\n\nin the equation given above?\n\n13.3 WHERE DOES PHOTOSYNTHESIS TAKE PLACE?\n\nYou would of course answer: in ‘the green leaf’ or ‘in the chloroplasts’,\n\nbased on what you earlier read in Chapter 8. You are definitely right.\n\nPhotosynthesis does take place in the green leaves of plants but it does so\n\nalso in other green parts of the plants. Can you name some other parts\n\nwhere you think photosynthesis may occur?\n\nYou would recollect from previous unit that the mesophyll cells in the\n\nleaves, have a large number of chloroplasts. Usually the chloroplasts align\n\nthemselves along the walls of the mesophyll cells, such that they get the\n\noptimum quantity of the incident light. When do you think the\n\nchloroplasts will be aligned with their flat surfaces parallel to the walls?\n\nWhen would they be perpendicular to the incident light?\n\nYou have studied the structure of chloroplast in Chapter 8. Within\n\nthe chloroplast there is membranous system consisting of grana, the\n\nstroma lamellae, and the matrix stroma (Figure 13.2). There is a clear\n\ndivision of labour within the chloroplast. The membrane system is\n\nresponsible for trapping the light energy and also for the synthesis of ATP\n\nand NADPH. In stroma, enzymatic reactions synthesise sugar, which in\n\nturn forms starch. The former set of reactions, since they are directly light\n\ndriven are called light reactions (photochemical reactions). The latter\n\nare not directly light driven but are dependent on the products of light\n\nreactions (ATP and NADPH). Hence, to distinguish the latter they are called,\n\nby convention, as dark reactions (carbon reactions). However, this should\n\nnot be construed to mean that they occur in darkness or that they are not\n\nlight-dependent.\n\nFigure 13.2 Diagrammatic representation of an electron micrograph of a section of\nchloroplast\n\nOuter membrane\n\nInner membrane\n\nStromal lamella\n\nGrana\n\nStroma\n\nRibosomes\n\nStarch granule\n\nLipid droplet\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n210 BIOLOGY\n\n13.4 HOW MANY TYPES OF PIGMENTS ARE\nINVOLVED IN PHOTOSYNTHESIS?\n\nLooking at plants have you ever wondered why\n\nand how there are so many shades of green in\n\ntheir leaves – even in the same plant? We can\n\nlook for an answer to this question by trying to\n\nseparate the leaf pigments of any green  plant\n\nthrough paper chromatography. A\n\nchromatographic separation of the leaf pigments\n\nshows that the colour that we see in leaves is\n\nnot due to a single pigment but due to four\n\npigments: Chlorophyll a (bright or blue green\n\nin the chromatogram), chlorophyll b (yellow\n\ngreen), xanthophylls (yellow) and carotenoids\n\n(yellow to yellow-orange).  Let us now see what\n\nroles various pigments play in photosynthesis.\n\nPigments are substances that have an ability\n\nto absorb light, at specific wavelengths. Can you\n\nguess which is the most abundant plant\n\npigment in the world? Let us study the graph\n\nshowing the ability of chlorophyll a pigment to\n\nabsorb lights of different wavelengths (Figure\n\n13.3 a). Of course, you are familiar with the\n\nwavelength of the visible spectrum of light as\n\nwell as the VIBGYOR.\n\nFrom Figure 13.3a can you determine the\n\nwavelength (colour of light) at which chlorophyll\n\na shows the maximum absorption? Does it\n\nshow another absorption peak at any other\n\nwavelengths too? If yes, which one?\n\nNow look at Figure 13.3b showing the\n\nwavelengths at which maximum photosynthesis\n\noccurs in a plant. Can you see that the\n\nwavelengths at which there is maximum\n\nabsorption by chlorophyll a, i.e., in the blue and\n\nthe red regions, also shows higher rate of\n\nphotosynthesis. Hence, we can conclude that\n\nchlorophyll a is the chief pigment associated\n\nwith photosynthesis. But by looking at Figure\n\n13.3c  can you say that there is a complete\n\none-to-one overlap between the absorption\n\nspectrum of chlorophyll a and the action\n\nspectrum of photosynthesis?\n\nFigure 13.3a Graph showing the absorption\nspectrum of chlorophyll a, b and\nthe carotenoids\n\nFigure 13.3b Graph showing action\nspectrum of photosynthesis\n\nFigure 13.3c Graph showing action\nspectrum of photosynthesis\nsuperimposed on absorption\nspectrum of chlorophyll a\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHOTOSYNTHESIS IN HIGHER PLANTS 211\n\nThese graphs, together, show that most of the photosynthesis takes\n\nplace in the blue and red regions of the spectrum; some photosynthesis\n\ndoes take place at the other wavelengths of the visible spectrum.  Let us\n\nsee how this happens. Though chlorophyll is the major pigment\n\nresponsible for trapping light, other thylakoid pigments like chlorophyll\n\nb, xanthophylls and carotenoids, which are called accessory pigments,\n\nalso absorb light and transfer the energy to chlorophyll a. Indeed, they\n\nnot only enable a wider range of wavelength of incoming light to be utilised\n\nfor photosyntesis but also protect chlorophyll a from photo-oxidation.\n\n13.5 WHAT IS LIGHT REACTION?\n\nLight reactions or the ‘Photochemical’ phase\n\ninclude light absorption, water splitting, oxygen\n\nrelease, and the formation of high-energy\n\nchemical intermediates, ATP and NADPH.\n\nSeveral protein complexes are involved in the\n\nprocess. The pigments are organised into two\n\ndiscrete photochemical light harvesting\n\ncomplexes (LHC) within the Photosystem I (PS\n\nI) and Photosystem II (PS II).  These are named\n\nin the sequence of their discovery, and not in\n\nthe sequence in which they function during the\n\nlight reaction. The LHC are  made up of\n\nhundreds of pigment molecules bound to\n\nproteins. Each photosystem has all the pigments\n\n(except one molecule of chlorophyll a) forming\n\na light harvesting system also called antennae\n\n(Figure 13.4). These pigments help to make\n\nphotosynthesis more efficient by absorbing\n\ndifferent wavelengths of light. The single chlorophyll a molecule forms\n\nthe reaction centre. The reaction centre is different in both the\n\nphotosystems.  In PS I the reaction centre chlorophyll a has an absorption\n\npeak at 700 nm, hence is called P700, while in PS II it has absorption\n\nmaxima at 680 nm, and is called P680.\n\n13.6 THE ELECTRON TRANSPORT\n\nIn photosystem II the reaction centre chlorophyll a absorbs 680 nm\n\nwavelength of red light causing electrons to become excited and jump\n\ninto an orbit farther from the atomic nucleus. These electrons are picked\n\nup by an electron acceptor which passes them to an electrons transport\n\nPhoton Reaction\ncentre\n\nPigment\nmolecules\n\nPrimary acceptor\n\nFigure 13.4 The light harvesting complex\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n212 BIOLOGY\n\nsystem consisting of cytochromes (Figure\n\n13.5). This movement of electrons is downhill,\n\nin terms of an oxidation-reduction or redox\n\npotential scale. The electrons are not used up\n\nas they pass through the electron transport\n\nchain, but are passed on to the pigments of\n\nphotosystem PS I. Simultaneously, electrons\n\nin the reaction centre of PS I are also excited\n\nwhen they receive red light of wavelength 700\n\nnm and are transferred to another accepter\n\nmolecule that has a greater redox potential.\n\nThese electrons then are moved downhill\n\nagain,  this time to a molecule of energy-rich\n\nNADP+. The addition of these electrons reduces\n\nNADP+ to NADPH + H+.  This whole scheme of\n\ntransfer of electrons, starting from the PS II,\n\nuphill to the acceptor, down the electron\n\ntransport chain to PS I, excitation of electrons,\n\ntransfer to another acceptor, and finally down hill to NADP+ reducing it to\n\nNADPH + H+ is called the Z scheme, due to its characterstic shape (Figure\n\n13.5).  This shape is formed when all the carriers are placed in a sequence\n\non a redox potential scale.\n\n13.6.1 Splitting of Water\n\nYou would then ask, How does PS II supply electrons continuously? The\n\nelectrons that were moved from photosystem II must be replaced. This is\n\nachieved by electrons available due to splitting of water. The splitting of\n\nwater is associated with the PS II; water is split into 2H+, [O] and electrons.\n\nThis creates oxygen, one of the net products of photosynthesis. The\n\nelectrons needed to replace those removed from photosystem I are provided\n\nby photosystem II.\n\n2 4 42 2H O H O e\uf8e7 →\uf8e7 + +\n+ −\n\nWe need to emphasise here that the water splitting complex is associated\n\nwith the PS II, which itself is physically located on the inner side of the\n\nmembrane of the thylakoid. Then, where are the protons and O\n2 \nformed\n\nlikely to be released – in the lumen? or on the outer side of the membrane?\n\n13.6.2 Cyclic and Non-cyclic Photo-phosphorylation\n\nLiving organisms have the capability of extracting energy from oxidisable\n\nsubstances and store this in the form of bond energy. Special substances like\n\nATP, carry this energy in their chemical bonds. The process through which\n\nElectron\ntransport\nsystem\n\n-\n-\n\ne acceptor\ne acceptor\n\nLight\n\nPhotosystem II Photosystem I\n\nNADPH\n\nNADP+\n\nLHC\n\nLHC\n\nH O        2e + 2H  + [O]2 - +\n\nADP+iP ATP\n\nFigure 13.5 Z scheme of light reaction\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHOTOSYNTHESIS IN HIGHER PLANTS 213\n\nATP is synthesised by cells (in mitochondria and\n\nchloroplasts) is named phosphorylation. Photo-\n\nphosphorylation is the synthesis of ATP from\n\nADP and inorganic phosphate in the presence of\n\nlight. When the two photosystems work in a\n\nseries, first PS II and then the PS I, a process called\n\nnon-cyclic photo-phosphorylation occurs. The\n\ntwo photosystems are connected through an\n\nelectron transport chain, as seen earlier – in the\n\nZ scheme. Both ATP and NADPH + H+  are\n\nsynthesised by this kind of electron flow (Figure\n\n13.5).\n\nWhen only PS I is functional, the electron is\n\ncirculated within the photosystem and the\n\nphosphorylation occurs due to cyclic flow of\n\nelectrons (Figure 13.6). A possible location\n\nwhere this could be happening is in the stroma\n\nlamellae.  While the membrane or lamellae of the grana have both PS I\n\nand PS II the stroma lamellae membranes lack PS II as well as NADP\n\nreductase enzyme. The excited electron does not pass on to NADP+ but is\n\ncycled back to the PS I complex through the electron transport chain\n\n(Figure 13.6).  The cyclic flow hence, results only in the synthesis of ATP,\n\nbut not of NADPH + H+. Cyclic photophosphorylation also occurs when\n\nonly light of wavelengths beyond 680 nm are available for excitation.\n\n13.6.3 Chemiosmotic Hypothesis\n\nLet us now try and understand how actually ATP is synthesised in the\n\nchloroplast. The chemiosmotic hypothesis has been put forward to explain\n\nthe mechanism. Like in respiration, in photosynthesis too, ATP synthesis is\n\nlinked to development of a proton gradient across a membrane. This time\n\nthese are the membranes of thylakoid. There is one difference though, here\n\nthe proton accumulation is towards the inside of the membrane, i.e., in the\n\nlumen. In respiration, protons accumulate in the intermembrane space of\n\nthe mitochondria when electrons move through the ETS (Chapter 14).\n\nLet us understand what causes the proton gradient across the\n\nmembrane. We need to consider again the processes that take place during\n\nthe activation of electrons and their transport to determine the steps that\n\ncause a proton gradient to develop (Figure 13.7).\n\n(a) Since splitting of the water molecule takes place on the inner side of\n\nthe membrane, the protons or hydrogen ions that are produced by\n\nthe splitting of water accumulate within the lumen of the thylakoids.\n\nFigure 13.6 Cyclic photophosphorylation\n\nPhotosystem I\n\nLight\n\ne- acceptor\n\nElectron\ntransport\nsystem\n\nChlorophyll\nP 700\n\nA\nD\n\nP\n+\niP\n\nA\nT\nP\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n214 BIOLOGY\n\n(b) As electrons move through the photosystems, protons are transported\n\nacross the membrane.  This happens because the primary accepter of\n\nelectron which is located towards the outer side of the membrane\n\ntransfers its electron not to an electron carrier but to an H carrier.\n\nHence, this molecule removes a proton from the stroma while\n\ntransporting an electron.  When this molecule passes on its electron\n\nto the electron carrier on the inner side of the membrane, the proton\n\nis released into the inner side or the lumen side of the membrane.\n\n(c) The NADP reductase enzyme is located on the stroma side of the\n\nmembrane.  Along with electrons that come from the acceptor of\n\nelectrons of PS I, protons are necessary for the reduction of NADP+ to\n\nNADPH+ H+.  These protons are also removed from the stroma.\n\nHence, within the chloroplast, protons in the stroma decrease in\n\nnumber, while in the lumen there is accumulation of protons.  This creates\n\na proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane as well as a measurable\n\ndecrease in pH in the lumen.\n\nWhy are we so interested in the proton gradient?  This gradient is\nimportant because it is the breakdown of this gradient that leads to the\nsynthesis of ATP.  The gradient is broken down due to the movement of\nprotons across the membrane to the stroma through the transmembrane\n\nFigure 13.7 ATP synthesis through chemiosmosis\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHOTOSYNTHESIS IN HIGHER PLANTS 215\n\nchannel of the CF\n0\n of the ATP synthase. The ATP synthase enzyme consists\n\nof two parts: one called the CF\n0\n is embedded in the thylakoid membrane\n\nand forms a transmembrane channel that carries out facilitated diffusion\n\nof protons across the membrane. The other portion is called CF\n1\n and\n\nprotrudes on the outer surface of the thylakoid membrane on the side\n\nthat faces the stroma. The break down of the gradient provides enough\n\nenergy to cause a conformational change in the CF\n1\n particle of the ATP\n\nsynthase, which makes the enzyme synthesise several molecules of energy-\n\npacked ATP.\n\nChemiosmosis requires a membrane, a proton pump, a proton\n\ngradient and ATP synthase. Energy is used to pump protons across a\n\nmembrane, to create a gradient or a high concentration of protons within\n\nthe thylakoid lumen. ATP synthase has a channel that allows diffusion of\n\nprotons back across the membrane; this releases enough energy to activate\n\nATP synthase enzyme that catalyses the formation of ATP.\n\nAlong with the NADPH produced by the movement of electrons, the\n\nATP will be used immediately in the biosynthetic  reaction taking place in\n\nthe stroma, responsible for fixing CO\n2\n, and synthesis of sugars.\n\n13.7 WHERE ARE THE ATP AND NADPH USED?\n\nWe learnt that the products of light reaction are ATP, NADPH and O\n2\n. Of\n\nthese O\n2\n diffuses out of the chloroplast while ATP and NADPH are used to\n\ndrive the processes leading to the synthesis of food, more accurately, sugars.\n\nThis is the biosynthetic phase of photosynthesis. This process does not\n\ndirectly depend on the presence of light but is dependent on the products\n\nof the light reaction, i.e., ATP and NADPH, besides CO\n2 \nand H\n\n2\nO. You may\n\nwonder how this could be verified; it is simple: immediately after light\n\nbecomes unavailable, the biosynthetic process continues for some time,\n\nand then stops. If then, light is made available, the synthesis starts again.\n\nCan we, hence, say that calling the biosynthetic phase as the dark\n\nreaction is a misnomer? Discuss this amongst yourselves.\n\nLet us now see how the ATP and NADPH are used in the biosynthetic\n\nphase. We saw earlier that CO\n2\n is combined with H\n\n2\nO to produce (CH\n\n2\nO)\n\nn\n\nor sugars. It was of interest to scientists to find out how this reaction\n\nproceeded, or rather what was the first product formed when CO\n2\n is taken\n\ninto a reaction or fixed. Just after world war II, among the several efforts\n\nto put radioisotopes to beneficial use, the work of Melvin Calvin is\n\nexemplary. The use of radioactive 14C by him in algal photosynthesis\n\nstudies led to the discovery that the first CO\n2\n fixation product was a\n\n3-carbon organic acid. He also contributed to working out the complete\n\nbiosynthetic pathway; hence it was called Calvin cycle after him. The\n\nfirst product identified was 3-phosphoglyceric acid or in short PGA.\n\nHow many carbon atoms does it have?\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n216 BIOLOGY\n\nScientists also tried to know whether all plants have PGA as the first\n\nproduct of CO\n2\n fixation, or whether any other product was formed in\n\nother plants. Experiments conducted over a wide range of plants led to\n\nthe discovery of another group of plants, where the first stable product of\n\nCO\n2\n fixation was again an organic acid, but one which had 4 carbon\n\natoms in it. This acid was identified to be oxaloacetic acid or OAA.  Since\n\nthen CO\n2\n assimilation during photosynthesis  was said to be of two main\n\ntypes: those plants in which the first product of CO\n2\n fixation is a C\n\n3\n acid\n\n(PGA), i.e., the C\n3\n pathway, and those in which the first product was a C\n\n4\n\nacid (OAA), i.e., the C\n4\n pathway.  These two groups of plants showed\n\nother associated characteristics that we will discuss later.\n\n13.7.1 The Primary Acceptor of CO\n2\n\nLet us now ask ourselves a question that was asked by the scientists who\n\nwere struggling to understand the ‘dark reaction’. How many carbon atoms\n\nwould a molecule have which after accepting (fixing) CO\n2\n, would have 3\n\ncarbons (of PGA)?\n\nThe studies very unexpectedly showed that the acceptor molecule\n\nwas a 5-carbon ketose sugar – ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP).  Did any\n\nof you think of this possibility?  Do not worry; the scientists also took\n\na long time and conducted many experiments to reach this conclusion.\n\nThey also believed that since the first product was a C\n3\n acid, the primary\n\nacceptor would be a 2-carbon compound; they spent many years trying\n\nto identify a 2-carbon compound before they discovered the 5-carbon\n\nRuBP.\n\n13.7.2 The Calvin Cycle\n\nCalvin and his co-workers then worked out the whole pathway and showed\n\nthat the pathway operated in a cyclic manner; the RuBP was regenerated.\n\nLet us now see how the Calvin pathway operates and where the sugar is\n\nsynthesised.  Let us at the outset understand very clearly that the Calvin\n\npathway occurs in all photosynthetic plants; it does not matter whether\n\nthey have C\n3\n or C\n\n4\n (or any other) pathways (Figure 13.8).\n\nFor ease of understanding, the Calvin cycle can be described under\n\nthree stages: carboxylation, reduction and regeneration.\n\n1. Carboxylation – Carboxylation is the fixation of CO\n2\n into a stable organic\n\nintermediate.  Carboxylation is the most crucial step of the Calvin cycle\n\nwhere CO\n2\n is utilised for the carboxylation of RuBP.  This reaction is\n\ncatalysed by the enzyme RuBP carboxylase which results in the formation\n\nof two molecules of 3-PGA.  Since this enzyme also has an oxygenation\n\nactivity it would be more correct to call it RuBP carboxylase-oxygenase\n\nor RuBisCO.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHOTOSYNTHESIS IN HIGHER PLANTS 217\n\n2. Reduction – These are a series of reactions that lead to the formation\n\nof glucose.  The steps involve utilisation of 2 molecules of ATP for\n\nphosphorylation and two of NADPH for reduction per CO\n2\n molecule\n\nfixed.  The fixation of six molecules of CO\n2\n and 6 turns of the cycle are\n\nrequired for the formation of one molecule of glucose from the pathway.\n\n3. Regeneration – Regeneration of the CO\n2\n acceptor molecule RuBP is\n\ncrucial if the cycle is to continue uninterrupted.  The regeneration\n\nsteps require one ATP for phosphorylation to form RuBP.\n\nRibulose-1,5-\nbisphosphate\n\nAtmosphere\n\nC0\n2\n + H\n\n2\nO\n\nCarboxylation\n\nADP\n\nRegeneration\n3-phosphoglycerate\n\nTriose\nphosphate\n\nReduction\nATP\n\n+\nNADPH\n\nADP\n+\n\nP\ni\n +NADP+\n\nSucrose, starch\n\nATP\n\nFigure 13.8 The Calvin cycle proceeds in three stages : (1) carboxylation, during which\nCO\n\n2\n combines with ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate; (2) reduction, during which\n\ncarbohydrate is formed at the expense of the photochemically made ATP\nand NADPH; and (3) regeneration during which the CO\n\n2\n acceptor ribulose-\n\n1,5-bisphosphate is formed again so that the cycle continues\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n218 BIOLOGY\n\nHence for every CO\n2\n  molecule entering the Calvin cycle, 3 molecules\n\nof ATP and 2 of NADPH are required.  It is probably to meet this difference\n\nin number of ATP and NADPH used in the dark reaction that the cyclic\n\nphosphorylation takes place.\n\nTo make one molecule of glucose 6 turns of the cycle are required.\n\nWork out how many ATP and NADPH molecules will be required to make\n\none molecule of glucose through the Calvin pathway.\n\nIt might help you to understand all of this if we look at what goes in\n\nand what comes out of the Calvin cycle.\n\nIn Out\n\nSix CO\n2\n\nOne glucose\n\n18 ATP 18 ADP\n\n12 NADPH 12 NADP\n\n13.8 THE C\n4\n PATHWAY\n\nPlants that are adapted to dry tropical regions have the C\n4\n pathway\n\nmentioned earlier. Though these plants have the C\n4\n oxaloacetic acid as\n\nthe first CO\n2\n fixation product they use the C\n\n3\n pathway or the Calvin cycle\n\nas the main biosynthetic pathway. Then, in what way are they different\n\nfrom C\n3\n plants? This is a question that you may reasonably ask.\n\nC\n4\n plants are special: They have a special type of leaf anatomy, they\n\ntolerate higher temperatures, they show a response to high light intensities,\n\nthey lack a process called photorespiration and have greater productivity\n\nof biomass. Let us understand these one by one.\n\nStudy vertical sections of leaves, one of a C\n3\n plant and the other of a C\n\n4\n\nplant. Do you notice the differences? Do both have the same types of\n\nmesophylls?  Do they have similar cells around the vascular bundle sheath?\n\nThe particularly large cells around the vascular bundles of the C\n4\n\nplants are called bundle sheath cells, and the leaves which have such\n\nanatomy are said to have ‘Kranz’ anatomy. ‘Kranz’ means ‘wreath’ and\n\nis a reflection of the arrangement of cells.  The bundle sheath cells may\n\nform several layers around the vascular bundles; they are characterised\n\nby having a large number of chloroplasts, thick walls impervious to\n\ngaseous exchange and no intercellular spaces. You may like to cut a\n\nsection of the leaves of C\n4\n plants – maize or sorghum – to observe the\n\nKranz anatomy and the distribution of mesophyll cells.\n\nIt would be interesting for you to collect leaves of diverse species of\n\nplants around you and cut vertical sections of the leaves. Observe under\n\nthe microscope – look for the bundle sheath around the vascular\n\nbundles.  The presence of the bundle sheath would help you identify\n\nthe C\n4\n plants.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHOTOSYNTHESIS IN HIGHER PLANTS 219\n\nNow study the pathway shown in Figure 13.9. This pathway that has\n\nbeen named the Hatch and Slack Pathway, is again a cyclic process.  Let\n\nus study the pathway by listing the steps.\n\nThe primary CO\n2\n acceptor is a 3-carbon molecule phosphoenol\n\npyruvate (PEP) and is present in the mesophyll cells. The enzyme\n\nresponsible for this fixation is PEP carboxylase or PEPcase. It is important\n\nto register that the mesophyll cells lack RuBisCO enzyme. The C\n4\n acid\n\nOAA is formed in the mesophyll cells.\n\nIt then forms other 4-carbon compounds like malic acid or aspartic\n\nacid in the mesophyll cells itself, which are transported to the bundle\n\nsheath cells.  In the bundle sheath cells these C\n4\n acids are broken down\n\nto release CO\n2\n and a 3-carbon molecule.\n\nThe 3-carbon molecule is transported back to the mesophyll where it\n\nis converted to PEP again, thus, completing the cycle.\n\nThe CO\n2\n released in the bundle sheath cells enters the C\n\n3\n or the Calvin\n\npathway, a pathway common to all plants. The bundle sheath cells are\n\nFigure 13.9 Diagrammatic representation of the Hatch and Slack Pathway\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n220 BIOLOGY\n\nrich in an enzyme Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase\n\n(RuBisCO), but lack PEPcase.  Thus, the basic pathway that results in\n\nthe formation of the sugars, the Calvin pathway, is common to the C\n3\n and\n\nC\n4\n plants.\n\nDid you note that the Calvin pathway occurs in all the mesophyll\n\ncells of the C\n3\n plants? In the C\n\n4\n plants it does not take place in the\n\nmesophyll cells but does so only in the bundle sheath cells.\n\n13.9 PHOTORESPIRATION\n\nLet us try and understand one more process that creates an important\n\ndifference between C\n3\n and C\n\n4\n plants – Photorespiration. To understand\n\nphotorespiration we have to know a little bit more about the first step of\n\nthe Calvin pathway – the first CO\n2\n fixation step. This is the  reaction\n\nwhere RuBP combines with CO\n2\n to form 2 molecules of 3PGA, that is\n\ncatalysed by RuBisCO.\n\nRuBP CO PGA\nRuBisCo\n\n+ \uf8e7 →\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7 ×2 2 3\n\nRuBisCO that is the most abundant enzyme in the world (Do you\n\nwonder why?) is characterised by the fact that its active site can bind to\n\nboth CO\n2\n and O\n\n2\n – hence the name. Can you think how this could be\n\npossible? RuBisCO has a much greater affinity for CO\n2\n when the CO\n\n2\n: O\n\n2\n\nis nearly equal. Imagine what would happen if this were not so! This\n\nbinding is competitive. It is the relative concentration of O\n2\n and CO\n\n2\n that\n\ndetermines which of the two will bind to the enzyme.\n\nIn C\n3\n plants some O\n\n2\n does bind to RuBisCO, and hence CO\n\n2\n fixation is\n\ndecreased. Here the RuBP instead of being converted to  2 molecules of\n\nPGA binds with O\n2\n to form one molecule of phosphoglycerate and\n\nphosphoglycolate (2 Carbon) in a pathway called photorespiration. In\n\nthe photorespiratory pathway, there is neither synthesis of sugars, nor of\n\nATP. Rather it results in the release of CO\n2\n with the utilisation of ATP. In\n\nthe photorespiratory pathway there is no synthesis of ATP or NADPH.\n\nThe biological function of photorespiration is not known yet.\n\nIn C\n4\n plants photorespiration does not occur. This is because they\n\nhave a mechanism that increases the concentration of CO\n2\n at the enzyme\n\nsite.  This takes place when the C\n4\n acid from the mesophyll is broken\n\ndown in the bundle sheath cells to release CO\n2\n – this results in increasing\n\nthe intracellular concentration of CO\n2\n. In turn, this ensures that the\n\nRuBisCO functions as a carboxylase minimising the oxygenase activity.\n\nNow that you know that the C\n4\n plants lack photorespiration, you\n\nprobably can understand why productivity and yields are better in these\n\nplants. In addition these plants show tolerance to higher temperatures.\n\nBased on the above discussion can you compare plants showing\n\nthe C\n3\n and the C\n\n4\n pathway?

Photosynthesis is under the influence of\n\nseveral factors, both internal (plant) and external. The plant factors include\n\nthe number, size, age and orientation of leaves, mesophyll cells and\n\nchloroplasts, internal CO\n2\n concentration and the amount of chlorophyll.\n\nThe plant or internal factors are dependent on the genetic predisposition\n\nand the growth of the plant.\n\nThe external factors would include the availability of sunlight,\n\ntemperature, CO\n2\n concentration and water.  As a plant photosynthesises,\n\nall these factors will simultaneously affect its rate. Hence, though several\n\nfactors interact and simultaneously affect photosynthesis or CO\n2\n fixation,\n\nusually one factor is the major cause or is the one that limits the rate.\n\nHence, at any point the rate will be determined by the factor available at\n\nsub-optimal levels.\n\nWhen several factors affect any [bio] chemical process, Blackman’s\n\n(1905) Law of Limiting Factors comes into effect. This states the following:\n\nIf a chemical process is affected by more than one factor, then its\n\nrate will be determined by the factor which is nearest to its minimal\n\nvalue: it is the factor which directly affects the process if its quantity is\n\nchanged.\n\nFor example, despite the presence of a green\n\nleaf and optimal light and CO\n2\n conditions, the\n\nplant may not photosynthesise if the temperature\n\nis very low. This leaf, if given the optimal\n\ntemperature, will start photosynthesising.\n\n13.10.1 Light\n\nWe need to distinguish between light quality, light\n\nintensity and the duration of exposure to light,\n\nwhile discussing light as a factor that affects\n\nphotosynthesis. There is a linear relationship\n\nbetween incident light and CO\n2\n fixation rates at\n\nlow light intensities. At higher light intensities,\n\ngradually the rate does not show further increase\n\nas other factors become limiting (Figure 13.10).\n\nWhat is interesting to note is that light saturation\n\noccurs at 10 per cent of the full sunlight. Hence,\n\nexcept for plants in shade or in dense forests, light\n\nis rarely a limiting factor in nature. Increase in\nFigure 13.10 Graph of light intensity on the\n\nrate of photosynthesis\n\nR\na\nte\n\n o\nf \n\np\nh\n\no\nto\n\ns\ny\nn\n\nth\ne\ns\nis\n\nLight intensity\n\nA\n\nB C\n\nD\n\nE\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPHOTOSYNTHESIS IN HIGHER PLANTS 223\n\nincident light beyond a point causes the breakdown of chlorophyll and a\n\ndecrease in photosynthesis.\n\n13.10.2 Carbon dioxide Concentration\n\nCarbon dioxide is the major limiting factor for photosynthesis.  The\n\nconcentration of CO\n2\n is very low in the atmosphere (between 0.03 and\n\n0.04 per cent). Increase in concentration upto 0.05 per cent can cause an\n\nincrease in CO\n2\n fixation rates; beyond this the levels can become damaging\n\nover longer periods.\n\nThe C\n3\n and C\n\n4\n plants respond differently to CO\n\n2\n concentrations.  At\n\nlow light conditions neither group responds to high CO\n2\n conditions.  At\n\nhigh light intensities, both C\n3\n and C\n\n4 \nplants show increase in the rates of\n\nphotosynthesis. What is important to note is that the C\n4\n plants show\n\nsaturation at about 360 µlL-1 while C\n3\n responds to increased CO\n\n2\n\nconcentration and saturation is seen only beyond 450 µlL-1.  Thus, current\n\navailability of CO\n2\n levels is limiting to the C\n\n3\n plants.\n\nThe fact that C\n3\n plants respond to higher CO\n\n2\n concentration by\n\nshowing increased rates of photosynthesis leading to higher productivity\n\nhas been used for some greenhouse crops such as tomatoes and bell\n\npepper. They are allowed to grow in carbon dioxide enriched atmosphere\n\nthat leads to higher yields.\n\n13.10.3 Temperature\n\nThe dark reactions being enzymatic are temperature controlled. Though\n\nthe light reactions are also temperature sensitive they are affected to a\n\nmuch lesser extent. The C\n4\n plants respond to higher temperatures and\n\nshow higher rate of photosynthesis while C\n3\n plants have a much lower\n\ntemperature optimum.\n\nThe temperature optimum for photosynthesis of different plants also\n\ndepends on the habitat that they are adapted to.  Tropical plants have a\n\nhigher temperature optimum than the plants adapted to temperate\n\nclimates.\n\n13.10.4 Water\n\nEven though water is one of the reactants in the light reaction, the effect of\n\nwater as a factor is more through its effect on the plant, rather than directly\n\non photosynthesis. Water stress causes the stomata to close hence reducing\n\nthe CO\n2\n availability. Besides, water stress also makes leaves wilt, thus,\n\nreducing the surface area of the leaves and their metabolic activity as well.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n224 BIOLOGY\n\nSUMMARY\n\nGreen plants make their own food by photosynthesis. During this process carbon\n\ndioxide from the atmosphere is taken in by leaves through stomata and used for\n\nmaking carbohydrates, principally glucose and starch.  Photosynthesis takes place\n\nonly in the green parts of the plants, mainly the leaves. Within the leaves, the\n\nmesophyll cells have a large number of chloroplasts that are responsible for CO\n2\n\nfixation.  Within the chloroplasts, the membranes are sites for the light reaction,\n\nwhile the chemosynthetic pathway occurs in the stroma.  Photosynthesis has two\n\nstages: the light reaction and the carbon fixing reactions. In the light reaction the\n\nlight energy is absorbed by the pigments present in the antenna, and funnelled to\n\nspecial chlorophyll a molecules called reaction centre chlorophylls. There are two\n\nphotosystems, PS I and PS II. PS I has a 700 nm absorbing chlorophyll a P700\n\nmolecule at its reaction centre, while PS II has a P680 reaction centre that absorbs\n\nred light at 680 nm.  After absorbing light, electrons are excited and transferred\n\nthrough PS II and PS I and finally to NAD forming NADH. During this process a\n\nproton gradient is created across the membrane of the thylakoid. The breakdown\n\nof the protons gradient due to movement through the F\n0\n part of the ATPase enzyme\n\nreleases enough energy for synthesis of ATP.  Splitting of water molecules is\n\nassociated with PS II resulting in the release of O\n2\n, protons and transfer of electrons\n\nto PS II.\n\nIn the carbon fixation cycle, CO\n2\n is added by the enzyme, RuBisCO, to a 5-\n\ncarbon compound RuBP that is converted to 2 molecules of 3-carbon PGA. This\n\nis then converted to sugar by the Calvin cycle, and the RuBP is regenerated. During\n\nthis process ATP and NADPH synthesised in the light reaction are utilised. RuBisCO\n\nalso catalyses a wasteful oxygenation reaction in C\n3\n plants: photorespiration.\n\nSome tropical plants show a special type of photosynthesis called C\n4\n pathway.\n\nIn these plants the first product of CO\n2\n fixation that takes place in the mesophyll,\n\nis a 4-carbon compound.  In the bundle sheath cells the Calvin pathway is carried\n\nout for the synthesis of carbohydrates.\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1. By looking at a plant externally can you tell whether a plant is C\n3\n or C\n\n4\n? Why and\n\nhow?\n\n2. By looking at which internal structure of a plant can you tell whether a plant is\n\nC\n3 \nor C\n\n4\n? Explain.\n\n3.

What\n\nhappens when we breathe? Also, do all living organisms, including plants\n\nand microbes, breathe? If so, how?\n\nAll living organisms need energy for carrying out daily life activities,\n\nbe it absorption, transport, movement, reproduction or even breathing.\n\nWhere does all this energy come from? We know we eat food for energy –\n\nbut how is this energy taken from food?  How is this energy utilised? Do\n\nall foods give the same amount of energy? Do plants ‘eat’? Where do plants\n\nget their energy from? And micro-organisms – for their energy\n\nrequirements, do they eat ‘food’?\n\nYou may wonder at the several questions raised above – they may\n\nseem to be very disconnected.  But in reality, the process of breathing is\n\nvery much connected to the process of release of energy from food.  Let us\n\ntry and understand how this happens.\n\nAll the energy required for ‘life’ processes is obtained by oxidation of\n\nsome macromolecules that we call ‘food’. Only green plants and\n\ncyanobacteria can prepare their own food; by the process of photosynthesis\n\nthey trap light energy and convert it into chemical energy that is stored in\n\nthe bonds of carbohydrates like glucose, sucrose and starch.  We must\n\nremember that in green plants too, not all cells, tissues and organs\n\nphotosynthesise; only cells containing chloroplasts, that are most often\n\nlocated in the superficial layers, carry out photosynthesis.  Hence, even\n\nin green plants all other organs, tissues and cells that are non-green,\n\nneed food for oxidation. Hence, food has to be translocated to all non-\n\ngreen parts. Animals are heterotrophic, i.e., they obtain food from plants\n\nRESPIRATION IN PLANTS\n\nCHAPTER  14\n\n14.1 Do Plants\n\nBreathe?\n\n14.2 Glycolysis\n\n14.3 Fermentation\n\n14.4 Aerobic\n\nRespiration\n\n14.5 The Respiratory\n\nBalance Sheet\n\n14.6 Amphibolic\n\nPathway\n\n14.7 Respiratory\n\nQuotient\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nRESPIRATION IN PLANTS 227\n\ndirectly (herbivores) or indirectly (carnivores). Saprophytes like fungi are\n\ndependent on dead and decaying matter.  What is important to recognise\n\nis that ultimately all the food that is respired for life processes comes from\n\nphotosynthesis. This chapter deals with cellular respiration or the\n\nmechanism of breakdown of food materials within the cell to release\n\nenergy, and the trapping of this energy for synthesis of ATP.\n\nPhotosynthesis, of course, takes place within the chloroplasts (in the\n\neukaryotes), whereas the breakdown of complex molecules to yield energy\n\ntakes place in the cytoplasm and in the mitochondria  (also only in\n\neukaryotes).  The breaking of the C-C bonds of complex compounds\n\nthrough oxidation within the cells, leading to release of considerable\n\namount of energy is called respiration.  The compounds that are oxidised\n\nduring this process are known as respiratory substrates. Usually\n\ncarbohydrates are oxidised to release energy, but proteins, fats and even\n\norganic acids can be used as respiratory substances in some plants, under\n\ncertain conditions.  During oxidation within a cell, all the energy contained\n\nin respiratory substrates is not released free into the cell, or in a single\n\nstep. It is released in a series of slow step-wise reactions controlled by\n\nenzymes, and it is trapped as chemical energy in the form of ATP.  Hence,\n\nit is important to understand that the energy released by oxidation in\n\nrespiration is not (or rather cannot be) used directly but is used to\n\nsynthesise ATP, which is broken down whenever (and wherever) energy\n\nneeds to be utilised. Hence, ATP acts as the energy currency of the cell.\n\nThis energy trapped in ATP is utilised in various energy-requiring\n\nprocesses of the organisms, and the carbon skeleton produced during\n\nrespiration is used as precursors for biosynthesis of other molecules in\n\nthe cell.\n\n14.1 DO PLANTS BREATHE?\n\nWell, the answer to this question is not quite so direct.  Yes, plants require\n\nO\n2\n for respiration to occur and they also give out CO\n\n2\n.  Hence, plants have\n\nsystems in place that ensure the availability of O\n2\n.  Plants, unlike animals,\n\nhave no specialised organs for gaseous exchange but they have stomata\n\nand lenticels for this purpose. There are several reasons why plants can\n\nget along without respiratory organs. First, each plant part takes care of\n\nits own gas-exchange needs.  There is very little transport of gases from\n\none plant part to another.  Second, plants do not present great demands\n\nfor gas exchange.  Roots, stems and leaves respire at rates far lower than\n\nanimals do. Only during photosynthesis are large volumes of gases\n\nexchanged and, each leaf is well adapted to take care of its own needs\n\nduring these periods. When cells photosynthesise, availability of O\n2\n is not\n\na problem in these cells since O\n2\n is released within the cell.  Third, the\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n228 BIOLOGY\n\ndistance that gases must diffuse even in large, bulky plants is not great.\n\nEach living cell in a plant is located quite close to the surface of the plant.\n\n‘This is true for leaves’, you may ask, ‘but what about thick, woody stems\n\nand roots?’ In stems, the ‘living’ cells are organised in thin layers inside\n\nand beneath the bark. They also have openings called lenticels. The cells\n\nin the interior are dead and provide only mechanical support. Thus, most\n\ncells of a plant have at least a part of their surface in contact with air. This\n\nis also facilitated by the loose packing of parenchyma cells in leaves, stems\n\nand roots, which provide an interconnected network of air spaces.\n\nThe complete combustion of glucose, which produces CO\n2\n and H\n\n2\nO\n\nas end products, yields energy most of which is given out as heat.\n\nC H O O CO H O Energy6 12 6 2 2 26 6 6+ \uf8e7 →\uf8e7 + +\n\nIf this energy is to be useful to the cell, it should be able to utilise it to\n\nsynthesise other molecules that the cell requires.  The strategy that the\n\nplant cell uses is to catabolise the glucose molecule in such a way that\n\nnot all the liberated energy goes out as heat.  The key is to oxidise glucose\n\nnot in one step but in several small steps enabling some steps to be just\n\nlarge enough such that the energy released can be coupled to ATP\n\nsynthesis.  How this is done is, essentially, the story of respiration.\n\nDuring the process of respiration, oxygen is utilised, and carbon\n\ndioxide, water and energy are released as products. The combustion\n\nreaction requires oxygen. But some cells live where oxygen may or may\n\nnot be available. Can you think of such situations (and organisms) where\n\nO\n2\n is not available?   There are sufficient reasons to believe that the first\n\ncells on this planet lived in an atmosphere that lacked oxygen.  Even\n\namong present-day living organisms, we know of several that are adapted\n\nto anaerobic conditions.  Some of these organisms are facultative\n\nanaerobes, while in others the requirement for anaerobic condition is\n\nobligate.  In any case, all living organisms retain the enzymatic machinery\n\nto partially oxidise glucose without the help of oxygen.  This breakdown\n\nof glucose to pyruvic acid is called glycolysis.\n\n14.2 GLYCOLYSIS\n\nThe term glycolysis has originated from the Greek words, glycos for sugar,\n\nand lysis for splitting.  The scheme of glycolysis was given by Gustav\n\nEmbden, Otto Meyerhof, and J. Parnas, and is often referred to as the\n\nEMP pathway. In anaerobic organisms, it is the only process in respiration.\n\nGlycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell and is present in all living\n\norganisms.  In this process, glucose undergoes partial oxidation to form\n\ntwo molecules of pyruvic acid. In plants, this glucose is derived from\n\nsucrose, which is the end product of photosynthesis, or from storage\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nRESPIRATION IN PLANTS 229\n\ncarbohydrates. Sucrose is converted into glucose\n\nand fructose by the enzyme, invertase, and these\n\ntwo monosaccharides readily enter the glycolytic\n\npathway. Glucose and fructose are\n\nphosphorylated to give rise to glucose-6-\n\nphosphate by the activity of the enzyme\n\nhexokinase. This phosphorylated form of glucose\n\nthen isomerises to produce fructose-6-\n\nphosphate. Subsequent steps of metabolism of\n\nglucose and fructose are same.  The various steps\n\nof glycolysis are depicted in Figure 14.1. In\n\nglycolysis, a chain of ten reactions, under the\n\ncontrol of different enzymes, takes place to\n\nproduce pyruvate from glucose. While studying\n\nthe steps of glycolysis, please note the steps at\n\nwhich utilisation or synthesis of ATP or (in this\n\ncase) NADH + H+ take place.\n\nATP is utilised at two steps: first in the\n\nconversion of glucose into glucose 6-phosphate\n\nand second in the conversion of fructose\n\n6-phosphate to fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate.\n\nThe fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate is split\n\ninto dihydroxyacetone phosphate and\n\n3-phosphoglyceraldehyde (PGAL). We find\n\nthat there is one step where NADH + H+ is\n\nformed from NAD+; this is when\n\n3-phosphoglyceraldehyde (PGAL) is converted\n\nto 1, 3-bisphosphoglycerate (BPGA).  Two\n\nredox-equivalents are removed (in the form of\n\ntwo hydrogen atoms) from PGAL and transferred\n\nto a molecule of NAD+. PGAL is oxidised and\n\nwith inorganic phosphate to get converted into\n\nBPGA. The conversion of BPGA to\n\n3-phosphoglyceric acid (PGA), is also an energy\n\nyielding process; this energy is trapped by the\n\nformation of ATP.  Another ATP is synthesised\n\nduring the conversion of PEP to pyruvic acid.\n\nCan you then calculate how many ATP\n\nmolecules are directly synthesised in this\n\npathway from one glucose molecule?\n\nPyruvic acid is then the key product of\n\nglycolysis.

These are lactic acid fermentation, alcoholic\n\nfermentation and aerobic respiration. Fermentation takes place under\n\nanaerobic conditions in many prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes.\n\nFor the complete oxidation of glucose to CO\n2\n and H\n\n2\nO, however, organisms\n\nadopt Krebs’ cycle which is also called as aerobic respiration. This requires\n\nO\n2\n supply.\n\n14.3 FERMENTATION\n\nIn fermentation, say by yeast, the incomplete oxidation of glucose is\n\nachieved under anaerobic conditions by sets of reactions where pyruvic\n\nacid is converted to CO\n2\n and ethanol. The enzymes, pyruvic acid\n\ndecarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase catalyse these reactions. Other\n\norganisms like some bacteria produce lactic acid from pyruvic acid.  The\n\nsteps involved are shown in Figure 14.2. In animal cells also, like muscles\n\nduring exercise, when oxygen is inadequate for cellular respiration pyruvic\n\nacid is reduced to lactic acid by lactate dehydrogenase.  The reducing\n\nagent is NADH+H+  which is reoxidised to NAD+ in both the processes.\n\nIn both lactic acid and alcohol\n\nfermentation not much energy is released; less\n\nthan seven per cent of the energy in glucose\n\nis released and not all of it is trapped as high\n\nenergy bonds of ATP.  Also, the processes are\n\nhazardous – either acid or alcohol is\n\nproduced.  What is the net ATPs that is\n\nsynthesised (calculate how many ATP are\n\nsynthesised and deduct the number of ATP\n\nutilised during glycolysis) when one molecule\n\nof glucose is fermented to alcohol or lactic\n\nacid?  Yeasts poison themselves to death when\n\nthe concentration of alcohol reaches about 13\n\nper cent. What then would be the\n\nmaximum concentration of alcohol in\n\nbeverages that are naturally fermented?\n\nHow do you think alcoholic beverages of\n\nalcohol content greater than this concentration\n\nare obtained?\n\nWhat then is the process by which\n\norganisms can carry out complete oxidation\n\nof glucose and extract the energy stored to\n\nFigure 14.2 Major pathways of anaerobic\nrespiration\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nRESPIRATION IN PLANTS 231\n\nsynthesise a larger number of ATP molecules needed for cellular\n\nmetabolism?  In eukaryotes these steps take place within the mitochondria\n\nand this requires O\n2\n.\n \nAerobic respiration is the process that leads to a\n\ncomplete oxidation of organic substances in the presence of oxygen, and\n\nreleases CO\n2\n, water and a large amount of energy present in the substrate.\n\nThis type of respiration is most common in higher organisms. We will\n\nlook at these processes in the next section.\n\n14.4 AEROBIC RESPIRATION\n\nFor aerobic respiration to take place within the mitochondria, the final\n\nproduct of glycolysis, pyruvate is transported from the cytoplasm into\n\nthe mitochondria.  The crucial events in aerobic respiration are:\n\n• The complete oxidation of pyruvate by the stepwise removal of all\nthe hydrogen atoms, leaving three molecules of CO\n\n2\n.\n\n• The passing on of the electrons removed as part of the hydrogen\natoms to molecular O\n\n2 \n with simultaneous synthesis of ATP.\n\nWhat is interesting to note is that the first process takes place in the\n\nmatrix of the mitochondria while the second process is located on the\n\ninner membrane of the mitochondria.\n\nPyruvate, which is formed by the glycolytic catabolism of carbohydrates\n\nin the cytosol, after it enters mitochondrial matrix undergoes oxidative\n\ndecarboxylation by a complex set of reactions catalysed by pyruvic\n\ndehydrogenase. The reactions catalysed by pyruvic dehydrogenase require\n\nthe participation of several coenzymes, including NAD+ and  Coenzyme A.\n\nPyruvic acid CoA NAD\nMg\n\nPyruvate dehydrogenase\n+ + \uf8e7 →\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\n\n+\n+2\n\n\uf8e7\uf8e7 + + +\n+\n\nAcetyl CoA CO NADH H2\n\nDuring this process, two molecules of NADH are produced from the\n\nmetabolism of two molecules of pyruvic acid (produced from one glucose\n\nmolecule during glycolysis).\n\nThe acetyl CoA then enters a cyclic pathway, tricarboxylic acid cycle,\n\nmore commonly called as Krebs’ cycle after the scientist Hans Krebs who\n\nfirst elucidated it.\n\n14.4.1 Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle\n\nThe TCA cycle starts with the condensation of acetyl group with oxaloacetic\n\nacid (OAA) and water to yield citric acid (Figure 14.3). The reaction is\n\ncatalysed by the enzyme citrate synthase and a molecule of CoA is released.\n\nCitrate is then isomerised to isocitrate.  It is followed by two successive\n\nsteps of decarboxylation, leading to the formation of α-ketoglutaric acid\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n232 BIOLOGY\n\nFigure 14.3   The Citric acid cycle\n\nPyruvate\n(3C)\n\nAcetyl coenzyme A\n(2C)\n\nCitric acid\n(6C)\n\nOxaloacetic acid\n(4C)\n\nCO\n2\n\nNAD\n+\n\nNADH+H\n+\n\nNADH+H\n+\n\nNAD\n+\n\nNAD\n+\n\nCO\n2\n\nCITRIC ACID CYCLE\n\nα-ketoglutaric acid\n(5C)\n\nNADH+H\n+\n\nGDP\n\nGTP\n\nSuccinic acid\n(4C)\n\nMalic acid\n(4C)\n\nFADH2\n\nFAD\n+\n\nPyruvic acid NAD FAD H O ADP Pi\nMitochondrial Matrix\n\n+ + + + + \uf8e7 →\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\n+ +\n\n4 2 2 \uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7 + +\n+\n\n3 4 42CO NADH H\n\nand then succinyl-CoA.  In the remaining steps\n\nof citric acid cycle, succinyl-CoA is oxidised\n\nto OAA allowing the cycle to continue. During\n\nthe conversion of succinyl-CoA to succinic\n\nacid a molecule of GTP is synthesised. This is\n\na substrate level phosphorylation.  In a\n\ncoupled reaction GTP is converted to GDP with\n\nthe simultaneous synthesis of ATP from ADP.\n\nAlso there are three points in the cycle where\n\nNAD+ is reduced to NADH + H+ and one point\n\nwhere FAD+ is reduced to FADH\n2\n. The\n\ncontinued oxidation of acetyl CoA via the TCA\n\ncycle requires the continued replenishment of\n\noxaloacetic acid, the first member of the cycle.\n\nIn addition it also requires regeneration of\n\nNAD+ and FAD+ from NADH and FADH\n2\n\nrespectively. The summary equation for this\n\nphase of respiration may be written as follows:\n\n+ +2FADH ATP\n\nCoA NAD\n+\n\nNADH+H\n+\n\nCO2\n\nWe have till now seen that glucose has been broken down to release\n\nCO\n2\n and eight molecules of NADH + H+; two of  FADH\n\n2 \nhave been\n\nsynthesised besides just two molecules of ATP in TCA cycle.  You may be\n\nwondering why we have been discussing respiration at all – neither O\n2\n\nhas come into the picture nor the promised large number of ATP has yet\n\nbeen synthesised. Also what is the role of the NADH + H+ and FADH\n2 \nthat\n\nis synthesised?\n \nLet us now understand the role of O\n\n2\n in respiration and\n\nhow ATP is synthesised.\n\n14.4.2 Electron Transport System (ETS) and Oxidative\nPhosphorylation\n\nThe following steps in the respiratory process are to release and utilise\n\nthe energy stored in NADH+H+ and FADH\n2. \n\n This is accomplished when\n\nthey are oxidised through the electron transport system and the electrons\n\nare passed on to O\n2\n resulting in the formation of H\n\n2\nO.  The metabolic\n\npathway through which the electron passes from one carrier to another,\n\nis called the electron transport system (ETS) (Figure 14.4) and it is\n\npresent in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Electrons from NADH\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nRESPIRATION IN PLANTS 233\n\nproduced in the mitochondrial matrix\n\nduring citric acid cycle are oxidised by an\n\nNADH dehydrogenase (complex I), and\n\nelectrons are then transferred to\n\nubiquinone located\n\nwithin the inner membrane. Ubiquinone\n\nalso receives reducing equivalents via\n\nFADH\n2\n (complex II) that is generated\n\nduring oxidation of succinate in the citric\n\nacid cycle. The reduced ubiquinone\n\n(ubiquinol) is then oxidised with the\n\ntransfer of electrons to cytochrome c via\n\ncytochrome bc\n1\n complex (complex III).\n\nCytochrome c is a small protein attached\n\nto the outer surface of the inner\n\nmembrane and acts as a mobile carrier\n\nfor transfer of electrons between complex\n\nIII and IV.  Complex IV refers to\n\ncytochrome c oxidase complex containing\n\ncytochromes a and a\n3\n, and two copper\n\ncentres.\n\nWhen the electrons pass from one\n\ncarrier to another via complex I to IV in\n\nthe electron transport chain, they are\n\ncoupled to ATP synthase (complex V) for\n\nthe production of ATP from ADP and\n\ninorganic phosphate. The number of ATP\n\nmolecules synthesised depends on the\n\nnature of the electron donor. Oxidation of\n\none molecule of NADH gives rise to 3\n\nmolecules of ATP, while that of one\n\nmolecule of FADH\n2\n produces 2 molecules\n\nof ATP. Although the aerobic process of\n\nrespiration takes place only in the\n\npresence of oxygen, the role of oxygen is\n\nlimited to the terminal stage of the\n\nprocess.  Yet, the presence of oxygen is vital, since it drives the whole\n\nprocess by removing hydrogen from the system.  Oxygen acts as the final\n\nhydrogen acceptor. Unlike photophosphorylation where it is the light\n\nenergy that is utilised for the production of proton gradient required for\n\nphosphorylation, in respiration it is the energy of oxidation-reduction\n\nutilised for the same process. It is for this reason that the process is called\n\noxidative phosphorylation.\n\nYou have already studied about the mechanism of membrane-linked\n\nATP synthesis as explained by chemiosmotic hypothesis in the earlier\n\nchapter.  As mentioned earlier, the energy released during the electron\n\nFigure 14.4 Electron Transport System (ETS)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n234 BIOLOGY\n\ntransport system is utilised in synthesising ATP\n\nwith the help of ATP synthase (complex V).  This\n\ncomplex consists of two major components, F\n1\n\nand F\n0 \n\n(Figure 14.5).  The F\n1\n headpiece is a\n\nperipheral membrane protein complex and\n\ncontains the site for synthesis of ATP from ADP\n\nand inorganic phosphate. F\n0\n is an integral\n\nmembrane protein complex that forms the\n\nchannel through which protons cross the inner\n\nmembrane.  The passage of protons through the\n\nchannel is coupled to the catalytic site of the F\n1\n\ncomponent for the production of ATP.  For each\n\nATP produced, 4H+ passes through F\n0\n from the\n\nintermembrane space to the matrix down the\n\nelectrochemical proton gradient.\n\n14.5 THE RESPIRATORY BALANCE SHEET\n\nIt is possible to make calculations of the net gain of ATP for every glucose\n\nmolecule  oxidised; but in reality this can remain only a theoretical exercise.\n\nThese calculations can be made only on certain assumptions that:\n\n• There is a sequential, orderly pathway functioning, with one\nsubstrate forming the next and with glycolysis, TCA cycle and ETS\n\npathway following one after another.\n\n• The NADH synthesised in glycolysis is transferred into the\nmitochondria and undergoes oxidative phosphorylation.\n\n• None of the intermediates in the pathway are utilised to synthesise\nany other compound.\n\n• Only glucose is being respired – no other alternative substrates are\nentering in the pathway at any of the intermediary stages.\n\nBut this kind of assumptions are not really valid in a living system; all\n\npathways work simultaneously and do not take place one after another;\n\nsubstrates enter the pathways and are withdrawn from it as and when\n\nnecessary; ATP is utilised as and when needed;  enzymatic rates are\n\ncontrolled by multiple means.  Yet, it is useful to do this exercise to\n\nappreciate the beauty and efficiency of the living system in extraction\n\nand storing energy. Hence, there can be a net gain of 38 ATP molecules\n\nduring aerobic respiration of one molecule of glucose.\n\nFigure 14.5  Diagramatic presentation of ATP\nsynthesis in mitochondria\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nRESPIRATION IN PLANTS 235\n\nNow let us  compare  fermentation and aerobic respiration:\n\n• Fermentation accounts for only a partial breakdown of glucose\nwhereas in aerobic respiration it is completely degraded to CO\n\n2\n and\n\nH\n2\nO.\n\n• In fermentation there is a net gain of only two molecules of ATP for\neach molecule of glucose degraded to pyruvic acid whereas many\n\nmore molecules of ATP are generated under aerobic conditions.\n\n• NADH is oxidised to NAD+ rather slowly in fermentation, however\nthe reaction is very vigorous in case of aerobic respiration.\n\n14.6 AMPHIBOLIC PATHWAY\n\nGlucose is the favoured substrate for respiration.  All carbohydrates are\n\nusually first converted into glucose before they are used for respiration.\n\nOther substrates can also be respired, as has been mentioned earlier, but\n\nthen they do not enter the respiratory pathway at the first step. See Figure\n\n14.6 to see the points of entry of different substrates in the respiratory\n\npathway. Fats would need to be broken down into glycerol and fatty acids\n\nfirst. If fatty acids were to be respired they would first be degraded to\n\nacetyl CoA and enter the pathway. Glycerol would enter the pathway\n\nafter being converted to PGAL. The proteins would be degraded by\n\nproteases and the individual amino acids (after deamination) depending\n\non their structure would enter the pathway at some stage within the Krebs’\n\ncycle or even as pyruvate or acetyl CoA.\n\nSince respiration involves breakdown of substrates, the respiratory\n\nprocess has traditionally been considered a catabolic process and the\n\nrespiratory pathway as a catabolic pathway.  But is this understanding\n\ncorrect?  We have discussed above, at which points in the respiratory\n\npathway different substrates would enter if they were to be respired and\n\nused to derive energy. What is important to recognise is that it is these very\n\ncompounds that would be withdrawn from the respiratory pathway for the\n\nsynthesis of the said substrates. Hence, fatty acids would be broken down\n\nto acetyl CoA before entering the respiratory pathway when it is used as a\n\nsubstrate. But when the organism needs to synthesise fatty acids, acetyl\n\nCoA would be withdrawn from the respiratory pathway for it. Hence, the\n\nrespiratory pathway comes into the picture both during breakdown and\n\nsynthesis of fatty acids. Similarly, during breakdown and synthesis of\n\nprotein too, respiratory intermediates form the link. Breaking down\n\nprocesses within the living organism is catabolism, and synthesis is\n\nanabolism.  Because the respiratory pathway is involved in both anabolism\n\nand catabolism, it would hence be better to consider the respiratory pathway\n\nas an amphibolic pathway rather than as a catabolic one.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n236 BIOLOGY\n\n14.7 RESPIRATORY QUOTIENT\n\nLet us now look at another aspect of respiration. As you know, during\n\naerobic respiration, O\n2\n is consumed and CO\n\n2\n is released. The ratio of the\n\nvolume of CO\n2\n evolved to the volume of O\n\n2\n consumed in respiration is\n\ncalled the respiratory quotient (RQ) or respiratory ratio.\n\nRQ\nvolumeof CO evolved\n\nvolumeof O consumed\n=\n\n2\n\n2\n\nThe respiratory quotient depends upon the type of respiratory\n\nsubstrate used during respiration.\n\nWhen carbohydrates are used as substrate and are completely\n\noxidised, the RQ will be 1, because equal amounts of CO\n2\n and O\n\n2\n are\n\nevolved and consumed, respectively, as shown in the equation below :\n\nFigure 14.6 Interrelationship among metabolic pathways showing respiration\nmediated breakdown of different organic molecules to CO\n\n2\n and H\n\n2\n0\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nRESPIRATION IN PLANTS 237\n\nC H O O CO H O Energy6 12 6 2 2 26 6 6+ \uf8e7 →\uf8e7 + +\n\nRQ\nCO\n\nO\n= =\n\n6\n\n6\n1 02\n\n2\n\n.\n\nWhen fats are used in respiration, the RQ is less than 1. Calculations\n\nfor a fatty acid, tripalmitin, if used as a substrate is shown:\n\n2 145 102 98\n51 98 6 2 2 2\n\n( )C H O O CO H O energy+ \uf8e7 →\uf8e7 + +\n\n        Tripalmitin\n\nRQ\nCO\n\nO\n= =\n\n102\n\n145\n0 72\n\n2\n\n.\n\nWhen proteins are respiratory substrates the ratio would be about\n\n0.9.\n\nWhat is important to recognise is that in living organisms respiratory\n\nsubstrates are often more than one; pure proteins or fats are never used\n\nas respiratory substrates.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nPlants unlike animals have no special systems for breathing or gaseous exchange.\n\nStomata and lenticels allow gaseous exchange by diffusion. Almost all living cells\n\nin a plant have their surfaces exposed to air.\n\nThe breaking of C-C bonds of complex organic molecules by oxidation cells\n\nleading to the release of a lot of energy is called cellular respiration. Glucose is the\n\nfavoured substrate for respiration. Fats and proteins can also be broken down to\n\nyield energy. The initial stage of cellular respiration takes place in the cytoplasm.\n\nEach glucose molecule is broken through a series of enzyme catalysed reactions\n\ninto two molecules of pyruvic acid. This process is called glycolysis. The fate of the\n\npyruvate depends on the availability of oxygen and the organism. Under anaerobic\n\nconditions either lactic acid fermentation or alcohol fermentation occurs.\n\nFermentation takes place under anaerobic conditions in many prokaryotes,\n\nunicellular eukaryotes and in germinating seeds. In eukaryotic organisms aerobic\n\nrespiration occurs  in the presence of oxygen. Pyruvic acid is transported into the\n\nmitochondria where it is converted into acetyl CoA with the release of CO\n2\n. Acetyl\n\nCoA then enters the tricarboxylic acid pathway or Krebs’ cycle operating in the\n\nmatrix of the mitochondria. NADH + H+ and FADH\n2\n are generated in the Krebs’\n\ncycle. The energy in these molecules as well as that in the NADH + H+ synthesised\n\nduring glycolysis are used to synthesise ATP. This is accomplished through a\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n238 BIOLOGY\n\nsystem of electron carriers called electron transport system (ETS) located on the\n\ninner membrane of the mitochondria. The electrons, as they move through the\n\nsystem, release enough energy that are trapped to synthesise ATP. This is called\n\noxidative phosphorylation. In this process O\n2\n is the ultimate acceptor of electrons\n\nand it gets reduced to water.\n\nThe respiratory pathway is an amphibolic pathway as it involves both anabolism\n\nand catabolism. The respiratory quotient depends upon the type of respiratory\n\nsubstance used during respiration.\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1.

Have you ever thought about where and how the structures like roots,\n\nstems, leaves, flowers, fruits and seeds arise and that too in an orderly\n\nsequence? You are, by now, aware of the terms seed, seedling, plantlet,\n\nmature plant. You have also seen that trees continue to increase in height\n\nor girth over a period of time. However, the leaves, flowers and fruits of the\n\nsame tree not only have limited dimensions but also appear and fall\n\nperiodically and some time repeatedly. Why does vegetative phase precede\n\nflowering in a plant? All plant organs are made up of a variety of tissues; is\n\nthere any relationship between the structure of a cell, a tissue, an organ\n\nand the function they perform? Can the structure and the function of these\n\nbe altered? All cells of a plant are descendents of the zygote. The question\n\nis, then, why and how do they have different structural and functional\n\nattributes? Development is the sum of two processes: growth and\n\ndifferentiation. To begin with, it is essential and sufficient to know that the\n\ndevelopment of a mature plant from a zygote (fertilised egg) follow a precise\n\nand highly ordered succession of events. During this process a complex\n\nbody organisation is formed that produces roots, leaves, branches, flowers,\n\nfruits, and seeds, and eventually they die (Figure 15.1). The first step in the\n\nprocess of plant growth is seed germination. The seed germinates when\n\nfavourable conditions for growth exist in the environment. In absence of\n\nsuch favourable conditions the seeds do not germinate and goes into a\n\nperiod of suspended growth or rest. Once favourable conditions return,\n\nthe seeds resume metabolic activities and growth takes place.\n\nIn this chapter, you shall also study some of the factors which\n\ngovern and control these developmental processes. These factors are both\n\nintrinsic (internal) and extrinsic (external) to the plant.\n\nPLANT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\nCHAPTER  15\n\n15.1 Growth\n\n15.2 Differentiation,\n\nDedifferentiation\n\nand\n\nRedifferentiation\n\n15.3 Development\n\n15.4 Plant Growth\n\nRegulators\n\n15.5 Photoperiodism\n\n15.6 Vernalisation\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n240 BIOLOGY\n\n15.1 GROWTH\n\nGrowth is regarded as one of the most fundamental and conspicuous\n\ncharacteristics of a living being. What is growth? Growth can be defined\n\nas an irreversible permanent increase in size of an organ or its parts or\n\neven of an individual cell. Generally, growth is accompanied by metabolic\n\nprocesses (both anabolic and catabolic), that occur at the expense of\n\nenergy. Therefore, for example, expansion of a leaf is growth. How would\n\nyou describe the swelling of piece of wood when placed in water?\n\n15.1.1  Plant Growth Generally is Indeterminate\n\nPlant growth is unique because plants retain the capacity for unlimited\n\ngrowth throughout their life. This ability of the plants is due to the presence\n\nof meristems at certain locations in their body. The cells of such meristems\n\nhave the capacity to divide and self-perpetuate. The product, however,\n\nsoon loses the capacity to divide and such cells make up the plant body.\n\nThis form of growth wherein new cells are always being added to the\n\nplant body by the activity of the meristem is called the open form of growth.\n\nWhat would happen if the meristem ceases to divide? Does this ever\n\nhappen?\n\nIn Chapter 6, you have studied about the root apical meristem and\n\nthe shoot apical meristem. You know that they are responsible for the\n\nSeed coat\n\nEpicotyl\nhook\n\nCotyledons\nCotyledonSoil line\n\nEpicotyl\n\nHypocotyl\nHypocotyl\n\nFigure 15.1 Germination and seedling development in bean\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPLANT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT 241\n\nprimary growth of the plants and principally\n\ncontribute to the elongation of the plants along\n\ntheir axis. You also know that in dicotyledonous\n\nplants and gymnosperms, the lateral meristems,\n\nvascular cambium and cork-cambium appear\n\nlater in life. These are the meristems that cause\n\nthe increase in the girth of the organs in which\n\nthey are active. This is known as secondary\n\ngrowth of the plant (see Figure 15.2).\n\n15.1.2 Growth is Measurable\n\nGrowth, at a cellular level, is principally a\n\nconsequence of increase in the amount of\n\nprotoplasm. Since increase in protoplasm is\n\ndifficult to measure directly, one generally\n\nmeasures some quantity which is more or less\n\nproportional to it. Growth is, therefore,\n\nmeasured by a variety of parameters some of\n\nwhich are: increase in fresh weight, dry weight,\n\nlength, area, volume and cell number. You may\n\nfind it amazing to know that one single maize\n\nroot apical mersitem can give rise to more than\n\n17,500 new cells per hour, whereas cells in a\n\nwatermelon may increase in size by upto\n\n3,50,000 times. In the former, growth is\n\nexpressed as increase in cell number; the latter\n\nexpresses growth as increase in size of the cell.\n\nWhile the growth of a pollen tube is measured\n\nin terms of its length, an increase in surface area\n\ndenotes the growth in a dorsiventral leaf.\n\n15.1.3 Phases of Growth\n\nThe period of growth is generally divided into\n\nthree phases, namely, meristematic, elongation\n\nand maturation (Figure 15.3). Let us\n\nunderstand this by looking at the root tips. The\n\nconstantly dividing cells, both at the root apex\n\nand the shoot apex, represent the meristematic\n\nphase of growth. The cells in this region are rich\n\nin protoplasm, possess large conspicuous\n\nnuclei. Their cell walls are primary in nature,\n\nthin and cellulosic with abundant\n\nplasmodesmatal connections.

Zones\nA, B, C, D immediately behind the\napex have elongated most.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n242 BIOLOGY\n\nmeristematic zone represent the phase of elongation. Increased\n\nvacuolation, cell enlargement and new cell wall deposition are the\n\ncharacteristics of the cells in this phase. Further away from the apex, i.e.,\n\nmore proximal to the phase of elongation, lies the portion of axis which is\n\nundergoing the phase of maturation. The cells of this zone, attain their\n\nmaximal size in terms of wall thickening and protoplasmic modifications.\n\nMost of the tissues and cell types you have studied in Chapter 6 represent\n\nthis phase.\n\n15.1.4  Growth Rates\n\nThe increased growth per unit time is termed as growth rate. Thus, rate\n\nof growth can be expressed mathematically. An organism, or a part of the\n\norganism can produce more cells in a variety of ways.\n\nFigure15.4 Diagrammatic representation of : (a) Arithmetic (b) Geometric growth and\n(c) Stages during embryo development showing geometric and arithematic\nphases\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPLANT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT 243\n\nThe growth rate shows an increase that may be\n\narithmetic or geometrical (Figure 15.4).\n\nIn arithmetic growth, following mitotic cell\n\ndivision, only one daughter cell continues to divide\n\nwhile the other differentiates and matures. The\n\nsimplest expression of arithmetic growth is\n\nexemplified by a root elongating at a constant rate.\n\nLook at Figure 15.5. On plotting the length of the\n\norgan against time, a linear curve is obtained.\n\nMathematically, it is expressed as\n\nL\nt\n = L\n\n0\n + rt\n\nL\nt\n = length at time ‘t’\n\nL\n0\n = length at time ‘zero’\n\nr    = growth rate / elongation per unit time.\n\nLet us now see what happens in geometrical\n\ngrowth. In most systems, the initial growth is slow\n\n(lag phase), and it increases rapidly thereafter – at\n\nan exponential rate (log or exponential phase). Here,\n\nboth the progeny cells following mitotic cell division\n\nretain the ability to divide and continue to do so.\n\nHowever, with limited nutrient supply, the growth\n\nslows down leading to a stationary phase. If we plot\n\nthe parameter of growth against time, we get a typical\n\nsigmoid or S-curve (Figure 15.6). A sigmoid curve\n\nis a characteristic of living organism growing in a\n\nnatural environment. It is typical for all cells, tissues\n\nand organs of a plant. Can you think of more similar\n\nexamples? What kind of a curve can you expect in\n\na tree showing seasonal activities?\n\nThe exponential growth can be expressed as\n\nW\n1\n = W\n\n0\n ert\n\nW\n1\n = final size (weight, height, number etc.)\n\nW\n0\n = initial size at the beginning of the period\n\nr     = growth rate\n\nt     = time of growth\n\ne    = base of natural logarithms\n\nHere, r is the relative growth rate and is also the\n\nmeasure of the ability of the plant to produce new\n\nplant material, referred to as efficiency index. Hence,\n\nthe final size of W\n1\n depends on the initial size, W\n\n0\n.\n\nFigure 15.5 Constant linear growth, a plot\nof length L against time t\n\nFigure 15.6 An idealised sigmoid growth\ncurve typical of cells in culture,\nand many higher plants and\nplant organs\n\nS\niz\n\ne\n/\nw\n\ne\nig\n\nh\nt \n\no\nf \n\nth\ne\n o\n\nrg\na\nn\n\nE\nx\np\no\nn\ne\nn\nti\na\nl\np\nh\na\ns\ne\n\nLag phase\n\nTime\n\nStationary phase\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n244 BIOLOGY\n\nQuantitative comparisons between the growth of living system can\n\nalso be made in two ways : (i) measurement and the comparison of total\n\ngrowth per unit time is called the absolute growth rate. (ii) The growth of\n\nthe given system per unit time expressed on a common basis, e.g., per\n\nunit initial parameter is called the relative growth rate. In Figure 15.7\n\ntwo leaves, A and B, are drawn that are of different sizes but shows\n\nabsolute increase in area in the given time to give leaves, A1 and B1. However,\n\none of them shows much higher relative growth rate. Which one and why?\n\n15.1.5 Conditions for Growth\n\nWhy do you not try to write down what you think are necessary conditions\n\nfor growth? This list may have water, oxygen and nutrients as very essential\n\nelements for growth. The plant cells grow in size by cell enlargement which\n\nin turn requires water. Turgidity of cells helps in extension growth. Thus,\n\nplant growth and further development is intimately linked to the water\n\nstatus of the plant. Water also provides the medium for enzymatic activities\n\nneeded for growth. Oxygen helps in releasing metabolic energy essential\n\nfor growth activities. Nutrients (macro and micro essential elements) are\n\nrequired by plants for the synthesis of protoplasm and act as source of\n\nenergy.\n\nIn addition, every plant organism has an optimum temperature range\n\nbest suited for its growth. Any deviation from this range could be\n\ndetrimental to its survival. Environmental signals such as light and gravity\n\nalso affect certain phases/stages of growth.\n\nFigure15.7 Diagrammatic comparison of absolute and relative growth rates. Both\nleaves A and B have increased their area by 5 cm2 in a given time to\nproduce A1, B1 leaves.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPLANT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT 245\n\n15.2 DIFFERENTIATION, DEDIFFERENTIATION AND\nREDIFFERENTIATION\n\nThe cells derived from root apical and shoot-apical meristems and\n\ncambium differentiate and mature to perform specific functions. This act\n\nleading to maturation is termed as differentiation. During differentiation,\n\ncells undergo few to major structural changes both in their cell walls and\n\nprotoplasm. For example, to form a tracheary element, the cells would\n\nlose their protoplasm. They also develop a very strong, elastic,\n\nlignocellulosic secondary cell walls, to carry water to long distances even\n\nunder extreme tension. Try to correlate the various anatomical features\n\nyou encounter in plants to the functions they perform.\n\nPlants show another interesting phenomenon. The living differentiated\n\ncells, that by now have lost the capacity to divide can regain the capacity\n\nof division under certain conditions. This phenomenon is termed as\n\ndedifferentiation. For example, formation of meristems – interfascicular\n\ncambium and cork cambium from fully differentiated parenchyma cells.\n\nWhile doing so, such meristems/tissues are able to divide and produce\n\ncells that once again lose the capacity to divide but mature to perform\n\nspecific functions, i.e., get redifferentiated. List some of the tissues in a\n\nwoody dicotyledenous plant that are the products of redifferentiation.\n\nHow would you describe a tumour? What would you call the parenchyma\n\ncells that are made to divide under controlled laboratory conditions during\n\nplant tissue culture?\n\nRecall, in Section 15.1.1, we have mentioned that the growth in plants\n\nis open, i.e., it can be indeterminate or determinate. Now, we may say that\n\neven differentiation in plants is open, because cells/tissues arising out of\n\nthe same meristem have different structures at maturity. The final\n\nstructure at maturity of a cell/tissue is also determined by the location of\n\nthe cell within. For example, cells positioned away from root apical\n\nmeristems differentiate as root-cap cells, while those pushed to the\n\nperiphery mature as epidermis. Can you add a few more examples of\n\nopen differentiation correlating the position of a cell to  its position in an\n\norgan?\n\n15.3  DEVELOPMENT\n\nDevelopment is a term that includes all changes that an organism goes\n\nthrough during its life cycle from germination of the seed to senescence.\n\nDiagrammatic representation of the sequence of processes which\n\nconstitute the development of a cell of a higher plant is given in Figure\n\n15.8. It is also applicable to tissues/organs.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n246 BIOLOGY\n\nPlants follow different pathways in response to environment or phases\n\nof life to form different kinds of structures. This ability is called plasticity,\n\ne.g., heterophylly in cotton, coriander and larkspur. In such plants, the\n\nleaves of the juvenile plant are different in shape from those in mature\n\nplants. On the other hand, difference in shapes of leaves produced in air\n\nand those produced in water in buttercup also represent the\n\nheterophyllous development due to environment (Figure 15.9). This\n\nphenomenon of heterophylly is an example of plasticity.\n\nFigure 15.8  Sequence of the developmental process in a plant cell\n\nCell Division Death\n\nPlasmatic growth Differentiation\n\nExpansion\n(Elongation)\n\nMaturation\n\nMERISTEMATIC\nCELL\n\nSENESCENCE\n\nMATURE\nCELL\n\nFigure 15.9  Heterophylly in (a) larkspur and (b) buttercup\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPLANT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT 247\n\nThus, growth, differentiation and development are very closely related\n\nevents in the life of a plant. Broadly, development is considered as the\n\nsum of growth and differentiation. Development in plants (i.e., both growth\n\nand differentiation) is under the control of intrinsic and extrinsic factors.\n\nThe former includes both intracellular (genetic) or intercellular factors\n\n(chemicals such as plant growth regulators) while the latter includes light,\n\ntemperature, water, oxygen, nutrition, etc.\n\n15.4 PLANT GROWTH REGULATORS\n\n15.4.1 Characteristics\n\nThe plant growth regulators (PGRs) are small, simple molecules of diverse\n\nchemical composition. They could be indole compounds (indole-3-acetic\n\nacid, IAA); adenine derivatives (N6-furfurylamino purine, kinetin),\n\nderivatives of carotenoids (abscisic acid, ABA); terpenes (gibberellic acid,\n\nGA\n3\n) or gases (ethylene, C\n\n2\nH\n\n4\n). Plant growth regulators are variously\n\ndescribed as plant growth substances, plant hormones or phytohormones\n\nin literature.\n\nThe PGRs can be broadly divided into two groups based on their\n\nfunctions in a living plant body. One group of PGRs are involved in growth\n\npromoting activities, such as cell division, cell enlargement, pattern\n\nformation, tropic growth, flowering, fruiting and seed formation. These\n\nare also called plant growth promoters, e.g., auxins, gibberellins and\n\ncytokinins. The PGRs of the other group play an important role in plant\n\nresponses to wounds and stresses of biotic and abiotic origin. They are\n\nalso involved in various growth inhibiting activities such as dormancy\n\nand abscission. The PGR abscisic acid belongs to this group. The gaseous\n\nPGR, ethylene, could fit either of the groups, but it is largely an inhibitor\n\nof growth activities.\n\n15.4.2  The Discovery of Plant Growth Regulators\n\nInterestingly, the discovery of each of the five\n\nmajor groups of PGRs have been accidental.\n\nAll this started with the observation of Charles\n\nDarwin and his son Francis Darwin when they\n\nobserved that the coleoptiles of canary grass\n\nresponded to unilateral illumination by\n\ngrowing towards the light source\n\n(phototropism). After a series of experiments,\n\nit was concluded that the tip of coleoptile was\n\nthe site of transmittable influence that caused\n\nthe bending of the entire coleoptile (Figure\n\n15.10). Auxin was isolated by F.W. Went from\n\ntips of coleoptiles of oat seedlings.\n\nFigure 15.10 Experiment used to demonstrate\nthat tip of the coleoptile is the\nsource of auxin. Arrows indicate\ndirection of light\n\na b c d\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n248 BIOLOGY\n\nThe ‘bakanae’ (foolish seedling) disease of rice seedlings, was caused\n\nby a fungal pathogen Gibberella fujikuroi. E. Kurosawa (1926) reported\n\nthe appearance of symptoms of the disease in rice seedlings when they\n\nwere treated with sterile filtrates of the fungus. The active substances\n\nwere later identified as gibberellic acid.\n\nF. Skoog and his co-workers observed that from the internodal\n\nsegments of tobacco stems the callus (a mass of undifferentiated cells)\n\nproliferated only if, in addition to auxins the nutrients medium was\n\nsupplemented with one of the following: extracts of vascular tissues, yeast\n\nextract, coconut milk or DNA. Miller et al. (1955), later identified and\n\ncrystallised the cytokinesis promoting active substance that they\n\ntermed kinetin.\n\nDuring mid-1960s, three independent researches reported the\n\npurification and chemical characterisation of three different kinds of\n\ninhibitors: inhibitor-B, abscission II and dormin. Later all the three were\n\nproved to be chemically identical. It was named abscisic acid (ABA).\n\nH.H. Cousins (1910) confirmed the release of a volatile substance from\n\nripened oranges that hastened the ripening of stored unripened bananas.\n\nLater this volatile substance was identified as ethylene, a gaseous PGR.\n\nLet us study some of the physiological effects of these five categories\n\nof PGRs in the next section.\n\n15.4.3  Physiological Effects of Plant Growth Regulators\n\n15.4.3.1 Auxins\n\nAuxins (from Greek ‘auxein’ : to grow) was first isolated from human urine.\n\nThe term ‘auxin’ is applied to the indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), and to other\n\nnatural and synthetic compounds having certain growth regulating\n\nproperties. They are generally produced by the growing apices of the stems\n\nand roots, from where they migrate to the regions of their action. Auxins\n\nlike IAA and indole butyric acid (IBA) have been isolated from plants.\n\nNAA (naphthalene acetic acid) and 2, 4-D (2, 4-dichlorophenoxyacetic)\n\nare synthetic auxins. All these auxins have been used extensively in\n\nagricultural and horticultural practices.\n\nThey help to initiate rooting in stem cuttings, an application widely\n\nused for plant propagation. Auxins promote flowering e.g. in pineapples.\n\nThey help to prevent fruit and leaf drop at early stages but promote the\n\nabscission  of older mature leaves and fruits.\n\nIn most higher plants, the growing apical bud inhibits the growth of\n\nthe lateral (axillary) buds, a phenomenon called apical dominance.\n\nRemoval of shoot tips (decapitation) usually results in the growth of lateral\n\nbuds (Figure 15.11). It is widely applied in tea plantations, hedge-making.\n\nCan you explain why?\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPLANT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT 249\n\nAuxins also induce parthenocarpy, e.g., in\n\ntomatoes. They are widely used as herbicides.\n\n2, 4-D, widely used to kill dicotyledonous\n\nweeds, does not affect mature\n\nmonocotyledonous plants. It is used to prepare\n\nweed-free lawns by gardeners. Auxin also\n\ncontrols xylem differentiation and helps in cell\n\ndivision.\n\n15.4.3.2 Gibberellins\n\nGibberellins are another kind of promotory\n\nPGR. There are more than 100 gibberellins\n\nreported from widely different organisms such\n\nas fungi and higher plants. They are denoted\n\nas GA\n1\n, GA\n\n2\n, GA\n\n3\n and so on. However,\n\nGibberellic acid (GA\n3\n) was one of the first\n\ngibberellins to be discovered and remains the\n\nmost intensively studied form. All GAs are\n\nacidic. They produce a wide range of\n\nphysiological responses in the plants. Their ability to cause an increase\n\nin length of axis is used to increase the length of grapes stalks. Gibberellins,\n\ncause fruits like apple to elongate and improve its shape. They also delay\n\nsenescence. Thus, the fruits can be left on the tree longer so as to extend\n\nthe market period. GA\n3\n is used to speed up the malting process in brewing\n\nindustry.\n\nSugarcane stores carbohydrate as sugar in their stems. Spraying\n\nsugarcane crop with gibberellins increases the length of the stem, thus\n\nincreasing the yield by as much as 20 tonnes per acre.\n\nSpraying juvenile conifers with GAs hastens the maturity period, thus\n\nleading to early seed production. Gibberellins also promotes bolting\n\n(internode elongation just prior to flowering) in beet, cabbages and many\n\nplants with rosette habit.\n\n15.4.3.3 Cytokinins\n\nCytokinins have specific effects on cytokinesis, and were discovered as\n\nkinetin (a modified form of adenine, a purine) from the autoclaved herring\n\nsperm DNA. Kinetin does not occur naturally in plants. Search for natural\n\nsubstances with cytokinin-like activities led to the isolation of zeatin from\n\ncorn-kernels and coconut milk. Since the discovery of zeatin, several\n\nnaturally occurring cytokinins, and some synthetic compounds with cell\n\ndivision promoting activity, have been identified. Natural cytokinins are\n\nsynthesised in regions where rapid cell division occurs, for example, root\n\napices, developing shoot buds, young fruits etc. It helps to produce new\n\nFigure 15.11 Apical dominance in plants :\n(a) A plant with apical bud intact\n(b) A plant with apical bud removed\n\nNote the growth of lateral buds into\nbranches after decapitation.\n\n(a) (b)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n250 BIOLOGY\n\nleaves, chloroplasts in leaves, lateral shoot growth and adventitious shoot\n\nformation. Cytokinins help overcome the apical dominance. They promote\n\nnutrient mobilisation which helps in the delay of leaf senescence.\n\n15.4.3.4 Ethylene\n\nEthylene is a simple gaseous PGR. It is synthesised in large amounts\n\nby tissues undergoing senescence and ripening fruits. Influences of\n\nethylene on plants include horizontal growth of seedlings, swelling of\n\nthe axis and apical hook formation in dicot seedlings. Ethylene promotes\n\nsenescence and abscission of plant organs especially of leaves and\n\nflowers. Ethylene is highly effective in fruit ripening. It enhances the\n\nrespiration rate during ripening of the fruits. This rise in rate of\n\nrespiration is called respiratory climactic.\n\nEthylene breaks seed and bud dormancy, initiates germination in\n\npeanut seeds, sprouting of potato tubers. Ethylene promotes rapid\n\ninternode/petiole elongation in deep water rice plants. It helps leaves/\n\nupper parts of the shoot to remain above water. Ethylene also promotes\n\nroot growth and root hair formation, thus helping the plants to increase\n\ntheir absorption surface.\n\nEthylene is used to initiate flowering and for synchronising fruit-set\n\nin pineapples. It also induces flowering in mango. Since ethylene regulates\n\nso many physiological processes, it is one of the most widely used PGR in\n\nagriculture. The most widely used compound as source of ethylene is\n\nethephon. Ethephon in an aqueous solution is readily absorbed and\n\ntransported within the plant and releases ethylene slowly. Ethephon\n\nhastens fruit ripening in tomatoes and apples and accelerates abscission\n\nin flowers and fruits (thinning of cotton, cherry, walnut). It promotes female\n\nflowers in cucumbers thereby increasing the yield.\n\n15.4.3.5 Abscisic acid\n\nAs mentioned earlier, abscisic acid (ABA) was discovered for its role in\n\nregulating abscission and dormancy. But like other PGRs, it also has\n\nother wide ranging effects on plant growth and development. It acts as a\n\ngeneral plant growth inhibitor and an inhibitor of plant metabolism.\n\nABA inhibits seed germination. ABA stimulates the closure of stomata\n\nand increases the tolerance of plants to various kinds of stresses.\n\nTherefore, it is also called the stress hormone. ABA plays an important\n\nrole in seed development, maturation and dormancy. By inducing\n\ndormancy, ABA helps seeds to withstand desiccation and other factors\n\nunfavourable for growth. In most situations, ABA acts as an antagonist\n\nto GAs.\n\nWe may summarise that for any and every phase of growth,\n\ndifferentiation and development of plants, one or the other PGR has some\n\nrole to play. Such roles could be complimentary or antagonistic. These\n\ncould be individualistic or synergistic.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPLANT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT 251\n\nSimilarly, there are a number of events in the life of a plant where\n\nmore than one PGR interact to affect that event, e.g., dormancy in seeds/\n\nbuds, abscission, senescence, apical dominance, etc.\n\nRemember, the role of PGR is of only one kind of intrinsic control.\n\nAlong with genomic control and extrinsic factors, they play an important\n\nrole in plant growth and development. Many of the extrinsic factors such\n\nas temperature and light, control plant growth and development via PGR.\n\nSome of such events could be: vernalisation, flowering, dormancy, seed\n\ngermination, plant movements, etc.\n\nWe shall discuss briefly the role of light and temperature (both of them,\n\nthe extrinsic factors) on initiation of flowering.\n\n15.5 PHOTOPERIODISM\n\nIt has been observed that some plants require a periodic exposure to\n\nlight to induce flowering. It is also seen that such plants are able to\n\nmeasure the duration of exposure to light. For example, some plants\n\nrequire the exposure to light for a period exceeding a well defined critical\n\nduration, while others must be exposed to light for a period less than this\n\ncritical duration before the flowering is initiated in them. The former group\n\nof plants are called long day plants while the latter ones are termed\n\nshort day plants. The critical duration is different for different plants.\n\nThere are many plants, however, where there is no such correlation\n\nbetween exposure to light duration and induction of flowering response;\n\nsuch plants are called day-neutral plants (Figure 15.12). It is now also\n\nFigure 15.12  Photoperiodism : Long day, short day and day neutral plants\n\nLong day plant Short day plant Day neutral plant\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n252 BIOLOGY\n\nknown that not only the duration of light period but that the duration of\n\ndark period is also of equal importance. Hence, it can be said that flowering\n\nin certain plants depends not only on a combination of light and dark\n\nexposures but also their relative durations. This response of plants to\n\nperiods of day/night is termed photoperiodism. It is also interesting to\n\nnote that while shoot apices modify themselves into flowering apices prior\n\nto flowering, they (i.e., shoot apices of plants) by themselves cannot percieve\n\nphotoperiods. The site of perception of light/dark duration are the leaves.\n\nIt has been hypothesised that there is a hormonal substance(s) that is\n\nresponsible for flowering. This hormonal substance migrates from leaves\n\nto shoot apices for inducing flowering only when the plants are exposed\n\nto the necessary inductive photoperiod.\n\n15.6 VERNALISATION\n\nThere are plants for which flowering is either quantitatively or qualitatively\n\ndependent on exposure to low temperature. This phenomenon is termed\n\nvernalisation. It prevents precocious reproductive development late in\n\nthe growing season, and enables the plant to have sufficient time to reach\n\nmaturity. Vernalisation refers specially to the promotion of flowering by a\n\nperiod of low temperature. Some important food plants, wheat, barley,\n\nrye have two kinds of varieties: winter and spring varieties. The ‘spring’\n\nvariety are normally planted in the spring and come to flower and produce\n\ngrain before the end of the growing season. Winter varieties, however, if\n\nplanted in spring would normally fail to flower or produce mature grain\n\nwithin a span of a flowering season. Hence, they are planted in autumn.\n\nThey germinate, and over winter come out as small seedlings, resume\n\ngrowth in the spring, and are harvested usually around mid-summer.\n\nAnother example of vernalisation is seen in biennial plants. Biennials\n\nare monocarpic plants that normally flower and die in the second season.\n\nSugarbeet, cabbages, carrots are some of the common biennials.\n\nSubjecting the growing of a biennial plant to a cold treatment stimulates\n\na subsequent photoperiodic flowering response.\n\n15.7 SEED DORMANCY\n\nThere are certain seeds which fail to germinate even when external\n\nconditions are favourable. Such seeds are understood to be undergoing\n\na period of dormancy which is controlled not by external environment\n\nbut are under endogenous control or conditions within the seed itself.\n\nImpermeable and hard seed coat; presence of chemical inhibitors such\n\nas abscissic acids, phenolic acids, para-ascorbic acid; and immature\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nPLANT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT 253\n\nembryos are some of the reasons which causes seed dormancy. This dormancy\n\nhowever can be overcome through natural means and various other man-made\n\nmeasures. For example, the seed coat barrier in some seeds can be broken by\n\nmechanical abrasions using knives, sandpaper, etc. or vigorous shaking. In nature,\n\nthese abrasions are caused by microbial action, and passage through digestive\n\ntract of animals. Effect of inhibitory substances can be removed by subjecting the\n\nseeds to chilling conditions or by application of certain chemicals like gibberellic\n\nacid and nitrates. Changing the environmental conditions, such as light and\n\ntemperature are other methods to overcome seed dormancy.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nGrowth is one of the most conspicuous events in any living organism. It is an\n\nirreversible increase expressed in parameters such as size, area, length, height,\n\nvolume, cell number etc. It conspicuously involves increased protoplasmic material.\n\nIn plants, meristems are the sites of growth. Root and shoot apical meristems\n\nsometimes alongwith intercalary meristem, contribute to the elongation growth of\n\nplant axes. Growth is indeterminate in higher plants. Following cell division in root\n\nand shoot apical meristem cells, the growth could be arithmetic or geometrical.\n\nGrowth may not be and generally is not sustained at a high rate throughout the life\n\nof cell/tissue/organ/organism. One can define three principle phases of growth –\n\nthe lag, the log and the senescent phase. When a cell loses the capacity to divide, it\n\nleads to differentiation. Differentiation results in development of structures that is\n\ncommensurate with the function the cells finally has to perform. General principles\n\nfor differentiation for cell, tissues and organs are similar. A differentiated cell may\n\ndedifferentiate and then redifferentiate. Since differentiation in plants is open, the\n\ndevelopment could also be flexible, i.e., the development is the sum of growth and\n\ndifferentiation. Plant exhibit plasticity in development.\n\nPlant growth and development are under the control of both intrinsic and\n\nextrinsic factors. Intercellular intrinsic factors are the chemical substances, called\n\nplant growth regulators (PGR). There are diverse groups of PGRs in plants, principally\n\nbelonging to five groups: auxins, gibberellins, cytokinins, abscisic acid and ethylene.\n\nThese PGRs are synthesised in various parts of the plant; they control different\n\ndifferentiation and developmental events. Any PGR has diverse physiological effects\n\non plants. Diverse PGRs also manifest similar effects. PGRs may act synergistically\n\nor antagonistically. Plant growth and development is also affected by light,\n\ntemperature, nutrition, oxygen status, gravity and such external factors.\n\nFlowering in some plants is induced only when exposed to certain duration of\n\nphotoperiod. Depending on the nature of photoperiod requirements, the plants are\n\ncalled short day plants, long day plants and day-neutral plants. Certain plants\n\nalso need to be exposed to low temperature so as to hasten flowering later in life.\n\nThis treatement is known as vernalisation.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n254 BIOLOGY\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1.

Majority of these\nstudies employed either surviving tissue model or straightaway cell-\nfree systems. An explosion of knowledge resulted in molecular biology.\nMolecular physiology became almost synonymous with biochemistry\nand biophysics. However, it is now being increasingly realised that\nneither a purely organismic approach nor a purely reductionistic\nmolecular approach would reveal the truth about biological processes\nor living phenomena. Systems biology makes us believe that all living\nphenomena are emergent properties due to interaction among\ncomponents of the system under study. Regulatory network of molecules,\nsupra molecular assemblies, cells, tissues, organisms and indeed,\npopulations and communities, each create emergent properties. In the\nchapters under this unit, major human physiological processes like\ndigestion, exchange of gases, blood circulation, locomotion and\nmovement are described in cellular and molecular terms.

The major\n\ncomponents of our food are carbohydrates, proteins and fats. Vitamins\n\nand minerals are also required in small quantities. Food provides energy\n\nand organic materials for growth and repair of tissues. The water we take\n\nin, plays an important role in metabolic processes and also prevents\n\ndehydration of the body. Biomacromolecules in food cannot be utilised\n\nby our body in their original form. They have to be broken down and\n\nconverted into simple substances in the digestive system. This process of\n\nconversion of complex food substances to simple absorbable forms is\n\ncalled digestion and is carried out by our digestive system by mechanical\n\nand biochemical methods. General organisation of the human digestive\n\nsystem is shown in Figure 16.1.\n\n16.1 DIGESTIVE SYSTEM\n\nThe human digestive system consists of the alimentary canal and the\n\nassociated glands.\n\n16.1.1 Alimentary Canal\n\nThe alimentary canal begins with an anterior opening – the mouth, and it\nopens out posteriorly through the anus. The mouth leads to the buccal\ncavity or oral cavity. The oral cavity has a number of teeth and a muscular\ntongue. Each tooth is embedded in a socket of jaw bone (Figure16.2).\nThis type of attachment is called thecodont. Majority of mammals\nincluding human being forms two sets of teeth during their life, a set of\ntemporary milk or deciduous teeth replaced by a set of permanent or\nadult teeth. This type of dentition is called diphyodont.

Arrangement of teeth in each half of the upper and lower jaw in the\norder I, C, PM, M is represented by a dental formula which in human\n\nis \n2123\n\n2123\n. The hard chewing surface of the teeth, made up of enamel, helps\n\nin the mastication of food. The tongue is a freely movable muscular organ\n\nattached to the floor of the oral cavity by the frenulum. The upper surface\nof the tongue has small projections called papillae, some of which bear\n\ntaste buds.\n\nThe oral cavity leads into a short pharynx which serves as a common\npassage for food and air. The oesophagus and the trachea (wind pipe)\n\nopen into the pharynx. A cartilaginous flap called epiglottis prevents the\n\nentry of food into the glottis – opening of the wind pipe – during swallowing.\nThe oesophagus is a thin, long tube which extends posteriorly passing\n\nthrough the neck, thorax and diaphragm and leads to a ‘J’ shaped bag\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nDIGESTION AND ABSORPTION 259\n\nlike structure called stomach. A muscular\n\nsphincter (gastro-oesophageal) regulates the\n\nopening of oesophagus into the stomach.\nThe stomach, located in the upper left\n\nportion of the abdominal cavity, has four\n\nmajor parts – a cardiac portion into which\nthe oesophagus opens, a fundic region, body\n(main central region) and a pyloric portion\nwhich opens into the first part of small\nintestine (Figure 16.3). Small intestine is\n\ndistinguishable into three regions, a ‘C’\n\nshaped duodenum, a long coiled middle\nportion jejunum and a highly coiled ileum.\n\nThe opening of the stomach into the\n\nduodenum is guarded by the pyloric\nsphincter. Ileum opens into the large\n\nintestine. It consists of caecum, colon and\n\nrectum. Caecum is a small blind sac which\nhosts some symbiotic micro-organisms. A\n\nnarrow finger-like tubular projection, the\n\nvermiform appendix which is a vestigial\norgan, arises from the caecum. The caecum\n\nopens into the colon. The colon is divided\n\ninto four parts – an ascending, a transverse,\ndescending part and a sigmoid colon. The\n\ndescending part opens into the rectum\n\nwhich opens out through the anus.\nThe wall of alimentary canal from\n\noesophagus to rectum possesses four layers\n\n(Figure 16.4) namely serosa, muscularis,\nsub-mucosa and mucosa. Serosa is the\n\noutermost layer and is made up of a thin\n\nmesothelium (epithelium of visceral organs)\nwith some connective tissues. Muscularis is\n\nformed by smooth muscles usually\n\narranged into an inner circular and an outer\nlongitudinal layer. An oblique muscle layer\n\nmay be present in some regions. The sub-\n\nmucosal layer is formed of loose connective\ntissues containing nerves, blood and lymph\n\nvessels. In duodenum, glands are also\n\npresent in sub-mucosa. The innermost\nlayer lining the lumen of the alimentary\n\ncanal is the mucosa. This layer forms\n\nirregular folds (rugae) in the stomach and\nsmall finger-like foldings called villi in the\nsmall intestine (Figure 16.5). The cells lining\n\nthe villi produce numerous microscopic\n\nFigure 16.2 Arrangement of different types of\nteeth in the jaws on one side and\nthe sockets on the other side\n\nFigure 16.3 Anatomical regions of human\nstomach\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n260 BIOLOGY\n\nFigure 16.4 Diagrammatic representation of transverse section of gut\n\nprojections called microvilli giving a brush border\n\nappearance. These modifications increase the\n\nsurface area enormously. Villi are supplied with\na network of capillaries and a large lymph vessel\n\ncalled the lacteal. Mucosal epithelium has goblet\n\ncells which secrete mucus that help in lubrication.\nMucosa also forms glands in the stomach (gastric\n\nglands) and crypts in between the bases of villi in\n\nthe intestine (crypts of Lieberkuhn). All the four\nlayers show modifications in different parts of the\n\nalimentary canal.\n\n16.1.2 Digestive Glands\n\nThe digestive glands associated with the\nalimentary canal include the salivary glands, the\n\nliver and the pancreas.\n\nSaliva is mainly produced by three pairs of\nsalivary glands, the parotids (cheek), the sub-\n\nmaxillary/sub-mandibular (lower jaw) and the\n\nsub- linguals (below the tongue). These glands\nsituated just outside the buccal cavity secrete\n\nsalivary juice into the buccal cavity.\n\nLiver is the largest gland of the body weighing about 1.2 to 1.5 kg in\nan adult human. It is situated in the abdominal cavity, just below the\n\ndiaphragm and has two lobes. The hepatic lobules are the structural and\n\nfunctional units of liver containing hepatic cells arranged in the form of\ncords. Each lobule is covered by a thin connective tissue sheath called\n\nthe Glisson’s capsule. The bile secreted by the hepatic cells passes through\n\nthe hepatic ducts and is stored and concentrated in a thin muscular sac\ncalled the gall bladder. The duct of gall bladder (cystic duct) along with\n\nFigure 16.5 A section of small intestinal\nmucosa showing villi\n\nVilli\nLacteal\n\nCapillaries\n\nCrypts\n\nArtery\n\nVein\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nDIGESTION AND ABSORPTION 261\n\nthe hepatic duct from the liver forms the common bile duct (Figure 16.6).\n\nThe bile duct and the pancreatic duct open together into the duodenum\n\nas the common hepato-pancreatic duct which is guarded by a sphincter\ncalled the sphincter of Oddi.\n\nThe pancreas is a compound (both exocrine and endocrine) elongated\n\norgan situated between the limbs of the ‘C’ shaped duodenum. The\nexocrine portion secretes an alkaline pancreatic juice containing enzymes\n\nand the endocrine portion secretes hormones, insulin and glucagon.\n\nFigure 16.6 The duct systems of liver, gall bladder and pancreas\n\n16.2 DIGESTION OF FOOD\n\nThe process of digestion is accomplished by mechanical and chemical\n\nprocesses.\n\nThe buccal cavity performs two major functions, mastication of food\n\nand facilitation of swallowing. The teeth and the tongue with the help of\n\nsaliva masticate and mix up the food thoroughly. Mucus in saliva helps\n\nin lubricating and adhering the masticated food particles into a bolus.\n\nThe bolus is then conveyed into the pharynx and then into the oesophagus\n\nby swallowing or deglutition. The bolus further passes down through\n\nthe oesophagus by successive waves of muscular contractions called\n\nperistalsis. The gastro-oesophageal sphincter controls the passage of food\n\ninto the stomach.The saliva secreted into the oral cavity contains\n\nelectrolytes  and enzymes, salivary amylase and\n\nlysozyme. The chemical process of digestion is initiated in the oral cavity\n\nby the hydrolytic action of the carbohydrate splitting enzyme, the salivary\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n262 BIOLOGY\n\namylase. About 30 per cent of starch is hydrolysed here by this enzyme\n\n(optimum pH 6.8) into a disaccharide – maltose. Lysozyme present in\n\nsaliva acts as an antibacterial agent that prevents infections.\n\nStarch\nSalivary\n\n.\n\nAmylase\n\npH\nMaltose\n\n6 8\n\uf8e7 →\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\n\nThe mucosa of stomach has gastric glands. Gastric glands have three\n\nmajor types of cells namely -\n\n(i) mucus neck cells which secrete mucus;\n\n(ii) peptic or chief cells which secrete the proenzyme pepsinogen; and\n\n(iii) parietal or oxyntic cells which secrete HCl and intrinsic factor\n\n(factor essential for absorption of vitamin B\n12\n\n).\n\nThe stomach stores the food for 4-5 hours. The food mixes thoroughly\nwith the acidic gastric juice of the stomach by the churning movements\n\nof its muscular wall and is called the chyme. The proenzyme pepsinogen,\non exposure to hydrochloric acid gets converted into the active enzyme\npepsin, the proteolytic enzyme of the stomach. Pepsin converts proteins\n\ninto proteoses and peptones (peptides). The mucus and bicarbonates\n\npresent in the gastric juice play an important role in lubrication and\nprotection of the mucosal epithelium from excoriation by the highly\n\nconcentrated hydrochloric acid. HCl provides the acidic pH (pH 1.8)\n\noptimal for pepsins. Rennin is a proteolytic enzyme found in gastric juice\nof infants which helps in the digestion of milk proteins. Small amounts of\n\nlipases are also secreted by gastric glands.\n\nVarious types of movements are generated by the muscularis layer of\nthe small intestine. These movements help in a thorough mixing up of\n\nthe food with various secretions in the intestine and thereby facilitate\n\ndigestion. The bile, pancreatic juice and the intestinal juice are the\nsecretions released into the small intestine. Pancreatic juice and bile are\n\nreleased through the hepato-pancreatic duct. The pancreatic juice\n\ncontains inactive enzymes – trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen,\nprocarboxypeptidases, amylases, lipases and nucleases. Trypsinogen is\n\nactivated by an enzyme, enterokinase, secreted by the intestinal mucosa\n\ninto active trypsin, which in turn activates the other enzymes in the\npancreatic juice. The bile released into the duodenum contains bile\n\npigments (bilirubin and bili-verdin), bile salts, cholesterol and\n\nphospholipids but no enzymes. Bile helps in emulsification of fats, i.e.,\nbreaking down of the fats into very small micelles. Bile also activates lipases.\n\nThe intestinal mucosal epithelium has goblet cells which secrete\nmucus. The secretions of the brush border cells of the mucosa alongwith\nthe secretions of the goblet cells constitute the intestinal juice or\n\nsuccus entericus. This juice contains a variety of enzymes like\ndisaccharidases (e.g., maltase), dipeptidases, lipases, nucleosidases, etc.\nThe mucus alongwith the bicarbonates from the pancreas protects the\n\nintestinal mucosa from acid as well as provide an alkaline medium (pH\n\n7.8) for enzymatic activities. Sub-mucosal glands (Brunner’s glands) also\nhelp in this.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nDIGESTION AND ABSORPTION 263\n\nProteins, proteoses and peptones (partially hydrolysed proteins) in\n\nthe chyme reaching the intestine are acted upon by the proteolytic\nenzymes of pancreatic juice as given below:\n\nProteins\n\nPeptones\n\nProteoses\n\nTrypsin/Chymotrypsin\n\nCarboxyp\n\n\uf8fc\n\n\uf8fd\n\uf8f4\n\n\uf8fe\n\uf8f4\n\neeptidase\nDipeptides\uf8e7 →\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\n\nCarbohydrates in the chyme are hydrolysed by pancreatic amylase\n\ninto disaccharides.\n\nPolysaccharides starch Disaccharides\nAmylase\n\n( ) \uf8e7 →\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\n\nFats are broken down by lipases with the help of bile into di-and\n\nmonoglycerides.\n\nFats Diglycerides Monoglycerides\nLipases\n\n\uf8e7 →\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7 \uf8e7 →\uf8e7\n\nNucleases in the pancreatic juice acts on nucleic acids to form\n\nnucleotides and nucleosides\n\nNucleic acids Nucleotides Nucleosides\nNucleases\uf8e7 →\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7 \uf8e7 →\uf8e7\n\nThe enzymes  in the succus entericus act on the end products of the\n\nabove reactions to form the respective simple absorbable forms.

The simple substances thus\nformed are absorbed in the jejunum and ileum regions of the small\nintestine. The undigested and unabsorbed substances are passed on to\nthe large intestine.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n264 BIOLOGY\n\nNo significant digestive activity occurs in the large intestine. The\nfunctions of large intestine are:\n\n(i) absorption of some water, minerals and certain drugs;\n\n(ii) secretion of mucus which helps in adhering the waste (undigested)\nparticles together and lubricating it for an easy passage.\n\nThe undigested, unabsorbed substances called faeces enters into the caecum\nof the large intestine through ileo-caecal valve, which prevents the back flow of\nthe faecal matter.  It is temporarily stored in the rectum till defaecation.\n\nThe activities of the gastro-intestinal tract are under neural and\nhormonal control for proper coordination of different parts. The sight, smell\nand/or the presence of food in the oral cavity can stimulate the secretion of\nsaliva. Gastric and intestinal secretions are also, similarly, stimulated by\nneural signals. The muscular activities of different parts of the alimentary\ncanal can also  be moderated by neural mechanisms, both local and through\nCNS. Hormonal control of the secretion of digestive juices is carried out by\n\nlocal hormones produced by the gastric and intestinal mucosa.\n\nCALORIFIC VALUE OF PROTEIN, CARBOHYDRATE AND FAT\n\n(Boxed item – Not for evaluation)\n\n       The energy requirements of animals, and the energy content of food, are\nexpressed in terms of measure of heat energy because heat is the ultimate form\nof all energies. This is often measured to as calorie (cal) or joule (J), which is the\namount of heat energy required to raise the temperature of  1 g of water by 1 °C.\nSince this value is tiny amount of energy, physiologists commonly use kilocalorie\n(kcal) or kilo joule (kJ). One kilo calorie is the amount of energy required to raise\nthe temperature of 1 kg of water by 1 °C. Nutritionists, traditionally refer to kcal\nas the Calorie or Joule (always capitalised). The amount of heat liberated from\ncomplete combustion of 1 g food in a bomb calorimeter (a closed metal chamber\nfilled with O\n\n2\n) is its gross calorific or gross energy value. The actual amount of\n\nenergy combustion of 1 g of food is the physiologic value of food. Gross calorific\nvalues of carbohydrates, proteins and fats are 4.1 kcal/g, 5.65 kcal/g and 9.45\n\nkcal/g, respectively, whereas their physiologic values are 4.0 kcal/g, 4.0 kcal/g\n\nand 9.0 kcal/g, respectively.\n\n16.3 ABSORPTION OF DIGESTED PRODUCTS\n\nAbsorption is the process by which the end products of digestion pass\nthrough the intestinal mucosa into the blood or lymph. It is carried out by\npassive, active or facilitated transport mechanisms. Small amounts of\nmonosaccharides like glucose, amino acids and some electrolytes like\nchloride ions are generally absorbed by simple diffusion. The passage of\nthese substances into the blood depends upon the concentration gradients.\nHowever, some substances like glucose and amino acids are absorbed with\nthe help of carrier proteins. This mechanism is called the facilitated transport.\n\nTransport of water depends upon the osmotic gradient. Active\ntransport occurs against the concentration gradient and hence requires\nenergy. Various nutrients like amino acids, monosaccharides like glucose,\nelectrolytes like Na+ are absorbed into the blood by this mechanism.\n\nFatty acids and glycerol being insoluble, cannot be absorbed into the\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nDIGESTION AND ABSORPTION 265\n\nblood. They are first incorporated into small droplets called micelles which\nmove into the intestinal mucosa. They are re-formed into very small protein\ncoated fat globules called the chylomicrons which are transported into\nthe lymph vessels (lacteals) in the villi. These lymph vessels ultimately\nrelease the absorbed substances into the blood stream.\n\nAbsorption of substances takes place in different parts of the alimentary\ncanal, like mouth, stomach, small intestine and large intestine. However,\nmaximum absorption occurs in the small intestine. A summary of absorption\n(sites of absorption and substances absorbed) is given in Table 16.1.\n\nThe absorbed substances finally reach the tissues which utilise them\nfor their activities. This process is called assimilation.\n\nThe digestive wastes, solidified into coherent faeces in the rectum\ninitiate a neural reflex causing an urge or desire for its removal. The\negestion of faeces to the outside through the anal opening (defaecation) is\na voluntary process and is carried out by a mass peristaltic movement.\n\n16.4 DISORDERS OF DIGESTIVE SYSTEM\nThe inflammation of the intestinal tract is the most common ailment due\nto bacterial or viral infections. The infections are also caused by the\nparasites of the intestine like tapeworm, roundworm, threadworm,\nhookworm, pin worm, etc.\n\nJaundice: The liver is affected, skin and eyes turn yellow due to the\ndeposit of bile pigments.\n\nVomiting:  It is the ejection of stomach contents through the mouth.  This\nreflex action is controlled by the vomit centre in the medulla. A feeling of\nnausea precedes vomiting.\n\nDiarrhoea:  The abnormal frequency of bowel movement and increased\nliquidity of the faecal discharge is known as diarrhoea.  It reduces the\nabsorption of food.\n\nConstipation:  In constipation, the faeces are retained within the colon\nas the bowel movements occur irregularly.\n\nIndigestion:  In this condition, the food is not properly digested leading to\na feeling of fullness. The causes of indigestion are inadequate enzyme\nsecretion, anxiety, food poisoning, over eating, and spicy food.\n\nStomach\n\nAbsorption of\nwater, simple\nsugars, and\nalcohol etc.\ntakes place.\n\nSmall Intestine\n\nPrincipal organ for absorption\nof nutrients.  The digestion is\ncompleted here and the final\nproducts of digestion such as\nglucose, fructose, fatty acids,\nglycerol and amino acids are\nabsorbed through the mucosa\ninto the blood stream and\nlymph.\n\nMouth\n\nCertain drugs\ncoming in contact\nwith the mucosa\nof mouth and\nlower side of the\ntongue are\nabsorbed into the\nblood capillaries\nlining them.\n\nLarge Intestine\n\nAbsorption of\nwater, some\nminerals and\ndrugs takes\nplace.\n\nTABLE 16.1 The Summary of Absorption in Different Parts of Digestive System\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n266 BIOLOGY\n\nPEM\n\nDietary deficiencies of proteins and total food calories are widespread in\n\nmany underdeveloped countries of South and South-east Asia, South\n\nAmerica, and West and Central Africa. Protein-energy malnutrition\n\n(PEM) may affect large sections of the population during drought, famine\n\nand political turmoil. This happened in Bangladesh during the liberation\n\nwar and in Ethiopia during the severe drought in mid-eighties. PEM affects\n\ninfants and children to produce Marasmus and Kwashiorkar.\n\nMarasmus is produced by a simultaneous deficiency of proteins and\n\ncalories. It is found in infants less than a year in age, if mother’s milk is\n\nreplaced too early by other foods which are poor in both proteins and\n\ncaloric value. This often happens if the mother has second pregnancy or\n\nchildbirth when the older infant is still too young. In Marasmus, protein\n\ndeficiency impairs growth and replacement of tissue proteins; extreme\n\nemaciation of the body and thinning of limbs results, the skin becomes\n\ndry, thin and wrinkled. Growth rate and body weight decline considerably.\n\nEven growth and development of brain and mental faculties are impaired.\n\nKwashiorkar is produced by protein deficiency unaccompanied by calorie\n\ndeficiency. It results from the replacement of mother’s milk by a high calorie-\n\nlow protein diet in a child more than one year in age. Like marasmus,\n\nkwashiorkor shows wasting of muscles, thinning of limbs, failure of growth\n\nand brain development. But unlike marasmus, some fat is still left under\n\nthe skin; moreover, extensive oedema and swelling of body parts are seen.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe digestive system of humans consists of an alimentary canal and\nassociated digestive glands. The alimentary canal consists of the mouth,\nbuccal cavity, pharynx, oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, large\nintestine, rectum and the anus. The accessory digestive glands include the\nsalivary glands, the liver (with gall bladder) and the pancreas. Inside the\nmouth the teeth masticates the food, the tongue tastes the food and\nmanipulates it for proper mastication by mixing with the saliva. Saliva\ncontains a starch digestive enzyme, salivary amylase that digests the starch\nand converts it into maltose (disaccharide). The food then passes into the\npharynx and enters the oesophagus in the form of bolus, which is further\ncarried down through the oesophagus by peristalsis into the stomach. In\nstomach mainly protein digestion takes place. Absorption of simple sugars,\nalcohol and medicines also takes place in the stomach.\n\nThe chyme (food) enters into the duodenum portion of the small\nintestine and is acted on by the pancreatic juice, bile and finally by the\nenzymes in the succus entericus, so that the digestion of carbohydrates,\nproteins and fats is completed. The food then enters into the jejunum and\nileum portions of the small intestine. Carbohydrates are digested and\nconverted into monosaccharides like glucose. Proteins are finally broken\ndown into amino acids. The fats are converted to fatty acids and glycerol.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nDIGESTION AND ABSORPTION 267\n\nThe digested end products are absorbed into the body through the epithelial lining\nof the intestinal villi. The undigested food (faeces) enters into the caecum of the large\nintestine through ileo-caecal valve, which prevents the back flow of the faecal matter.\nMost of the water is absorbed in the large intestine. The undigested food becomes\nsemi-solid in nature and then enters into the rectum, anal canal and is finally egested\n\nout through the anus.\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1.

Carbon dioxide\n\n(CO\n2\n) which is harmful is also released during the above catabolic\n\nreactions. It is, therefore, evident that O\n2\n  has to be continuously provided\n\nto the cells and CO\n2 \nproduced by the cells have to be released out. This\n\nprocess of exchange of O\n2\n from the atmosphere with CO\n\n2\n produced by the\n\ncells is called breathing, commonly known as respiration. Place your\n\nhands on your chest; you can feel the chest moving up and down. You\n\nknow that it is due to breathing. How do we breathe? The respiratory\n\norgans and the mechanism of breathing are described in the following\n\nsections of this chapter.\n\n17.1 RESPIRATORY ORGANS\n\nMechanisms of breathing vary among different groups of animals\n\ndepending mainly on their habitats and levels of organisation. Lower\n\ninvertebrates like sponges, coelenterates, flatworms, etc., exchange O\n2\n\nwith CO\n2\n by simple diffusion over their entire body surface. Earthworms\n\nuse their moist cuticle and insects have a network of tubes (tracheal\n\ntubes) to transport atmospheric air within the body. Special vascularised\n\nstructures called gills (branchial respiration) are used by most of the\n\naquatic arthropods and molluscs whereas vascularised bags called lungs\n\n(pulmonary respiration) are used by the terrestrial forms for the exchange\n\nof gases. Among vertebrates, fishes use gills whereas amphibians, reptiles,\n\nbirds and mammals respire through lungs.

The nasal\n\nchamber opens into the pharynx, a portion of which is the common\n\npassage for food and air. The pharynx opens through the larynx region\n\ninto the trachea. Larynx is a cartilaginous box which helps in sound\n\nproduction and hence called the sound box. During swallowing glottis\n\ncan be covered by a thin elastic cartilaginous flap called epiglottis  to\n\nprevent the entry of food into the larynx. Trachea is a straight tube\n\nextending up to the mid-thoracic cavity, which divides at the level of\n\n5th thoracic vertebra into a right and left primary bronchi. Each bronchi\n\nundergoes repeated divisions to form the secondary and tertiary bronchi\n\nand bronchioles ending up in very thin terminal bronchioles. The\n\ntracheae, primary, secondary and tertiary bronchi, and initial\n\nbronchioles are supported by incomplete cartilaginous rings. Each\n\nterminal bronchiole gives rise to a number of very thin, irregular-walled\n\nand vascularised bag-like structures called alveoli. The branching\n\nnetwork of bronchi, bronchioles and alveoli comprise the lungs (Figure\n\n17.1). We have two lungs which are covered by a double layered pleura,\n\nwith pleural fluid between them. It reduces friction on the lung-surface.\n\nThe outer pleural membrane is in close contact with the thoracic\n\nBronchus\n\nLung\n\nheart\n\nDiaphragm\n\nEpiglottis\n\nLarynx\n\nTrachea\n\nCut end of rib Pleural membranes\n\nAlveoli\n\nPleural fluid\n\nBronchiole\n\nFigure 17.1 Diagrammatic view of human respiratory system (sectional view of\nthe left lung is also shown)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n270 BIOLOGY\n\nlining whereas the inner pleural membrane is in contact with the lung\n\nsurface. The part starting with the external nostrils up to the terminal\n\nbronchioles constitute the conducting part whereas the alveoli and their\n\nducts form the respiratory or exchange part of the respiratory system.\n\nThe conducting part transports the atmospheric air to the alveoli, clears\n\nit from foreign particles, humidifies and also brings the air to body\n\ntemperature. Exchange part is the site of actual diffusion of O\n2\n and CO\n\n2\n\nbetween blood and atmospheric air.\n\nThe lungs are situated in the thoracic chamber which is anatomically\n\nan air-tight chamber. The thoracic chamber is formed dorsally by the\n\nvertebral column, ventrally by the sternum, laterally by the ribs and on\n\nthe lower side by the dome-shaped diaphragm. The anatomical setup of\n\nlungs in thorax is such that any change in the volume of the thoracic\n\ncavity will be reflected in the lung (pulmonary) cavity. Such an\n\narrangement is essential for breathing, as we cannot directly alter the\n\npulmonary volume.\n\nRespiration involves the following steps:\n\n(i) Breathing or pulmonary ventilation by which atmospheric air\n\nis drawn in and CO\n2\n rich alveolar air is released out.\n\n(ii) Diffusion of gases (O\n2\n and CO\n\n2\n) across alveolar membrane.\n\n(iii) Transport of gases by the blood.\n\n(iv) Diffusion of O\n2\n and CO\n\n2\n between blood and tissues.\n\n(v) Utilisation of O\n2\n by the cells for catabolic reactions and resultant\n\nrelease of CO\n2\n (cellular respiration as dealt in the Chapter 14).\n\n17.2 MECHANISM OF BREATHING\n\nBreathing involves two stages : inspiration during which atmospheric\n\nair is drawn in and expiration by which the alveolar air is released out.\n\nThe movement of air into and out of the lungs is carried out by creating a\n\npressure gradient between the lungs and the atmosphere. Inspiration\n\ncan occur if the pressure within the lungs (intra-pulmonary pressure) is\n\nless than the atmospheric pressure, i.e., there is a negative pressure in\n\nthe lungs with respect to atmospheric pressure. Similarly, expiration takes\n\nplace when the intra-pulmonary pressure is higher than the atmospheric\n\npressure. The diaphragm and a specialised set of muscles – external and\n\ninternal intercostals between the ribs, help in generation of such gradients.\n\nInspiration is initiated by the contraction of diaphragm which increases\n\nthe volume of thoracic chamber in the antero-posterior axis. The\n\ncontraction of external inter-costal muscles lifts up the ribs and the\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n271BREATHING AND EXCHANGE OF GASES\n\nsternum causing an increase in the volume of\n\nthe thoracic chamber in the  dorso-ventral axis.\n\nThe overall increase in the thoracic volume\n\ncauses a similar increase in pulmonary\n\nvolume. An increase in pulmonary volume\n\ndecreases the intra-pulmonary pressure to less\n\nthan the atmospheric pressure which forces\n\nthe air from outside to move into the lungs,\n\ni.e., inspiration (Figure 17.2a). Relaxation of\n\nthe diaphragm and the inter-costal muscles\n\nreturns the diaphragm and sternum to their\n\nnormal positions and reduce the thoracic\n\nvolume and thereby the pulmonary volume.\n\nThis leads to an increase in intra-pulmonary\n\npressure to slightly above the atmospheric\n\npressure causing the expulsion of air from the\n\nlungs, i.e., expiration (Figure 17.2b). We have\n\nthe ability to increase the strength of\n\ninspiration and expiration with the help of\n\nadditional muscles in the abdomen. On an\n\naverage, a healthy human breathes 12-16\n\ntimes/minute. The volume of air involved in\n\nbreathing movements can be estimated by\n\nusing a spirometer which helps in clinical\n\nassessment of pulmonary functions.\n\n17.2.1 Respiratory Volumes and\nCapacities\n\nTidal Volume (TV): Volume of air inspired or\n\nexpired during a normal respiration. It is\n\napprox. 500 mL., i.e., a healthy man can\n\ninspire or expire approximately 6000 to 8000\n\nmL of air per minute.\n\nInspiratory Reserve Volume (IRV):\n\nAdditional volume of air, a person can inspire\n\nby a forcible inspiration. This averages 2500\n\nmL to 3000 mL.\n\nExpiratory Reserve Volume (ERV):\n\nAdditional volume of air, a person can expire\n\nby a forcible expiration. This averages 1000\n\nmL to 1100 mL.\n\nFigure 17.2  Mechanism of breathing showing :\n(a) inspiration  (b) expiration\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n272 BIOLOGY\n\nResidual Volume (RV): Volume of air remaining in the lungs even after a\n\nforcible expiration. This averages 1100 mL to 1200 mL.\n\nBy adding up a few respiratory volumes described above, one can\n\nderive various pulmonary capacities, which can be used in clinical\n\ndiagnosis.\n\nInspiratory Capacity (IC): Total volume of air a person can inspire\n\nafter a normal expiration. This includes tidal volume and inspiratory\n\nreserve volume ( TV+IRV).\n\nExpiratory Capacity (EC): Total volume of air a person can expire after\n\na normal inspiration. This includes tidal volume and expiratory reserve\n\nvolume (TV+ERV).\n\nFunctional Residual Capacity (FRC): Volume of air that will remain in\n\nthe lungs after a normal expiration. This includes ERV+RV.\n\nVital Capacity (VC): The maximum volume of air a person can breathe in\n\nafter a forced expiration. This includes ERV, TV and IRV or the maximum\n\nvolume of air a person can breathe out after a forced inspiration.\n\nTotal Lung Capacity (TLC): Total volume of air accommodated in the\n\nlungs at the end of a forced inspiration. This includes RV, ERV, TV and\n\nIRV or vital capacity + residual volume.\n\n17.3 EXCHANGE OF GASES\n\nAlveoli are the primary sites of exchange of gases. Exchange of gases also\n\noccur between blood and tissues. O\n2\n and CO\n\n2\n are exchanged in these\n\nsites by simple diffusion mainly based on pressure/concentration\n\ngradient. Solubility of the gases as well as the thickness of the membranes\n\ninvolved in diffusion are also some important factors that can affect the\n\nrate of diffusion.\n\nPressure contributed by an individual gas in a mixture of gases is\n\ncalled partial pressure and is represented as pO\n2\n for oxygen and pCO\n\n2\n for\n\ncarbon dioxide. Partial pressures of these two gases in the atmospheric\n\nair and the two sites of diffusion are given in Table 17.1 and in\n\nFigure 17.3. The data given in the table clearly indicates a concentration\n\ngradient for oxygen from alveoli to blood and blood to tissues. Similarly,\n\nTABLE 17.1 Partial Pressures (in mm Hg) of Oxygen and Carbon dioxide at Different\nParts Involved in Diffusion in Comparison to those in Atmosphere\n\nRespiratory Atmospheric Alveoli Blood Blood Tissues\n\nGas Air (Deoxygenated) (Oxygenated)\n\nO\n2\n\n159 104 40 95 40\n\nCO\n2\n\n0.3 40 45 40 45\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n273BREATHING AND EXCHANGE OF GASES\n\na gradient is present for CO\n2\n in the opposite direction, i.e., from tissues to\n\nblood and blood to alveoli. As the solubility of CO\n2\n is 20-25 times higher\n\nthan that of O\n2\n, the amount of CO\n\n2\n that can diffuse through the diffusion\n\nmembrane per unit difference in partial pressure is much higher compared\n\nto that of O\n2\n. The diffusion membrane\n\nis made up of three major layers\n\n(Figure 17.4) namely, the thin squamous\n\nepithelium of alveoli, the endothelium of\n\nalveolar capillaries and the basement\n\nsubstance (composed of a thin basement\n\nmembrane supporting the squamous\n\nepithelium and the basement membrane\n\nsurrounding the single layer endothelial\n\ncells of capillaries)  in between them.\n\nHowever, its total thickness is much less\n\nthan a millimetre. Therefore, all the factors\n\nin our body are favourable for diffusion of\n\nO\n2\n from alveoli to tissues and that of CO\n\n2\n\nfrom tissues to alveoli.\n\nFigure 17.4 A Diagram of a section of an\nalveolus with a pulmonary\ncapillary.\n\nFigure 17.3 Diagrammatic representation of exchange of gases at the alveolus and\nthe body tissues with blood and transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n274 BIOLOGY\n\n17.4 TRANSPORT OF GASES\n\nBlood is the medium of transport for O\n2\n and CO\n\n2\n. About 97 per cent of O\n\n2\n is\n\ntransported by RBCs in the blood. The remaining 3 per cent of O\n2\n is carried\n\nin a dissolved state through the plasma. Nearly 20-25 per cent of CO\n2\n is\n\ntransported by RBCs whereas 70 per cent of it is carried as bicarbonate.\n\nAbout 7 per cent of CO\n2\n is carried in a dissolved state through plasma.\n\n17.4.1 Transport of Oxygen\n\nHaemoglobin is a red coloured iron containing pigment present in the\n\nRBCs. O\n2\n can bind with haemoglobin in a reversible manner to form\n\noxyhaemoglobin. Each haemoglobin molecule can carry a maximum of\n\nfour molecules of O\n2\n. Binding of oxygen with haemoglobin is primarily\n\nrelated to partial pressure of O\n2\n. Partial pressure of CO\n\n2\n, hydrogen ion\n\nconcentration and temperature are the other factors which can interfere\n\nwith this binding. A sigmoid curve is obtained when percentage saturation\n\nof haemoglobin with O\n2\n is plotted against the\n\npO\n2\n. This curve is called the Oxygen\n\ndissociation curve (Figure 17.5) and is highly\n\nuseful in studying the effect of factors like\n\npCO\n2\n, H+ concentration, etc., on binding of O\n\n2\n\nwith haemoglobin. In the alveoli, where there\n\nis high pO\n2\n, low pCO\n\n2\n, lesser H+ concentration\n\nand lower temperature, the factors are\n\nall favourable for the formation of\n\noxyhaemoglobin, whereas in the tissues,\n\nwhere low pO\n2\n, high pCO\n\n2\n, high H+\n\nconcentration and higher temperature exist,\n\nthe conditions are favourable for dissociation\n\nof oxygen from the oxyhaemoglobin. This\n\nclearly indicates that O\n2\n gets bound to\n\nhaemoglobin in the lung surface and gets\n\ndissociated at the tissues. Every 100 ml of\n\noxygenated blood can deliver around 5 ml of\n\nO\n2\n to the tissues under normal physiological\n\nconditions.\n\n17.4.2   Transport of Carbon dioxide\n\nCO\n2\n is carried by haemoglobin as carbamino-haemoglobin (about\n\n20-25 per cent). This binding is related to the partial pressure of CO\n2\n.\n\npO\n2\n is a major factor which could affect this binding. When pCO\n\n2\n is high\n\nand pO\n2\n is low as in the tissues, more binding of carbon dioxide occurs\n\nwhereas, when the pCO\n2\n is low and pO\n\n2\n is high as in the alveoli, dissociation\n\n20\n\n0 20\n\n40\n\n40\n\n60\n\n60\n\n80\n\n80\n\n100\n\n100\n\nPartial pressure of oxygen (mm Hg)\n\nP\ne\nr\nc\ne\nn\n\nta\ng\ne\n s\n\na\ntu\n\nr\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n o\nf \nh\n\na\ne\nm\n\no\ng\nlo\n\nb\nin\n\n w\nit\n\nh\n o\n\nx\ny\ng\ne\nn\n\nFigure 17.5  Oxygen dissociation curve\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n275BREATHING AND EXCHANGE OF GASES\n\nof CO\n2\n from carbamino-haemoglobin takes place, i.e., CO\n\n2\n which is bound\n\nto haemoglobin from the tissues is delivered at the alveoli. RBCs contain\n\na very high concentration of the enzyme, carbonic anhydrase and minute\n\nquantities of the same is present in the plasma too.

At the alveolar site where pCO\n2\n is low, the reaction proceeds in\n\nthe opposite direction leading to the formation of CO\n2\n and H\n\n2\nO. Thus,\n\nCO\n2\n trapped as bicarbonate at the tissue level and transported to the\n\nalveoli is released out as CO\n2 \n(Figure 17.4). Every 100 ml of deoxygenated\n\nblood delivers approximately 4 ml of CO\n2\n to the alveoli.\n\n17.5 REGULATION OF RESPIRATION\n\nHuman beings have a significant ability to maintain and moderate the\n\nrespiratory rhythm to suit the demands of the body tissues. This is done\n\nby the neural system. A specialised centre present in the medulla region\n\nof the brain called respiratory rhythm centre is primarily responsible for\n\nthis regulation. Another centre present in the pons region of the brain\n\ncalled pneumotaxic centre can moderate the functions of the respiratory\n\nrhythm centre. Neural signal from this centre can reduce the duration of\n\ninspiration and thereby alter the respiratory rate. A chemosensitive area\n\nis situated adjacent to the rhythm centre which is highly sensitive to CO\n2\n\nand hydrogen ions. Increase in these substances can activate this centre,\n\nwhich in turn can signal the rhythm centre to make necessary adjustments\n\nin the respiratory process by which these substances can be eliminated.\n\nReceptors associated with aortic arch and carotid artery also can recognise\n\nchanges in CO\n2\n and H+ concentration and send necessary signals to the\n\nrhythm centre for remedial actions. The role of oxygen in the regulation of\n\nrespiratory rhythm is quite insignificant.\n\n17.6 DISORDERS OF RESPIRATORY SYSTEM\n\nAsthma is a difficulty in breathing causing wheezing due to inflammation\n\nof bronchi and bronchioles.\n\nEmphysema is a chronic disorder in which alveolar walls are damaged\n\ndue to which respiratory surface is decreased. One of the major causes of\n\nthis is cigarette smoking.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n276 BIOLOGY\n\nSUMMARY\n\nCells utilise oxygen for metabolism and produce energy along with substances\n\nlike carbon dioxide which is harmful. Animals have evolved different mechanisms\n\nfor the transport of oxygen to the cells and for the removal of carbon dioxide from\n\nthere. We have a well developed respiratory system comprising two lungs and\n\nassociated air passages to perform this function.\n\nThe first step in respiration is breathing by which atmospheric air is taken in\n\n(inspiration) and the alveolar air is released out (expiration). Exchange of O\n2\n and\n\nCO\n2\n between deoxygenated blood and alveoli, transport of these gases throughout\n\nthe body by blood, exchange of O\n2\n and CO\n\n2\n between the oxygenated blood and\n\ntissues and utilisation of O\n2\n by the cells (cellular respiration) are the other steps\n\ninvolved.\n\nInspiration and expiration are carried out by creating pressure gradients\n\nbetween the atmosphere and the alveoli with the help of specialised muscles –\n\nintercostals and diaphragm. Volumes of air involved in these activities can be\n\nestimated with the help of spirometer and are of clinical significance.\n\nExchange of O\n2\n and CO\n\n2\n at the alveoli and tissues occur by diffusion. Rate of\n\ndiffusion is dependent on the partial pressure gradients of O\n2\n (pO\n\n2\n) and CO\n\n2\n (pCO\n\n2\n),\n\ntheir solubility as well as the thickness of the diffusion surface. These factors in\n\nour body facilitate diffusion of O\n2\n from the alveoli to the deoxygenated blood as\n\nwell as from the oxygenated blood to the tissues. The factors are favourable for the\n\ndiffusion of CO\n2\n in the opposite direction, i.e., from tissues to alveoli.\n\nOxygen is transported mainly as oxyhaemoglobin. In the alveoli where pO\n2\n is\n\nhigher, O\n2\n gets bound to haemoglobin which is easily dissociated at the tissues\n\nwhere pO\n2\n is low and pCO\n\n2\n and H+ concentration are high. Nearly 70 per cent of\n\ncarbon dioxide is transported as bicarbonate (HCO\n3\n–) with the help of the enzyme\n\ncarbonic anhydrase. 20-25 per cent of carbon dioxide is carried by haemoglobin\n\nas carbamino-haemoglobin. In the tissues where pCO\n2\n is high, it gets bound to\n\nblood whereas in the alveoli where pCO\n2 \nis low and pO\n\n2\n is high, it gets removed\n\nfrom the blood.\n\nRespiratory rhythm is maintained by the respiratory centre in the medulla\n\nregion of brain. A pneumotaxic centre in the pons region of the brain and a\n\nchemosensitive area in the medulla can alter respiratory mechanism.\n\nOccupational Respiratory Disorders: In certain industries, especially\n\nthose involving grinding or stone-breaking, so much dust is produced\n\nthat the defense mechanism of the body cannot fully cope with the\n\nsituation. Long exposure can give rise to inflammation leading to fibrosis\n\n(proliferation of fibrous tissues) and thus causing serious lung damage.\n\nWorkers in such industries should wear protective masks.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n277BREATHING AND EXCHANGE OF GASES\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1.

Also, the waste or harmful substances\n\nproduced, have to be removed continuously for healthy functioning of\n\ntissues. It is therefore, essential to have efficient mechanisms for the\n\nmovement of these substances to the cells and from the cells. Different\n\ngroups of animals have evolved different methods for this transport. Simple\n\norganisms like sponges and coelenterates circulate water from their\n\nsurroundings through their body cavities to facilitate the cells to exchange\n\nthese substances. More complex organisms use special fluids within their\n\nbodies to transport such materials. Blood is the most commonly used body\n\nfluid by most of the higher organisms including humans for this purpose.\n\nAnother body fluid, lymph, also helps in the transport of certain substances.\n\nIn this chapter, you will learn about the composition and properties of\n\nblood and lymph (tissue fluid) and the mechanism of circulation of blood\n\nis also explained herein.\n\n18.1 BLOOD\n\nBlood is a special connective tissue consisting of a fluid matrix, plasma,\n\nand formed elements.\n\n18.1.1 Plasma\n\nPlasma is a straw coloured, viscous fluid constituting nearly 55 per cent of\n\nthe blood. 90-92 per cent of plasma is water and proteins contribute 6-8\n\nper cent of it. Fibrinogen, globulins and albumins are the major proteins.\n\nBODY FLUIDS AND CIRCULATION\n\nCHAPTER  18\n\n18.1 Blood\n\n18.2 Lymph (Tissue\n\nFluid)\n\n18.3 Circulatory\n\nPathways\n\n18.4 Double\n\nCirculation\n\n18.5 Regulation of\n\nCardiac Activity\n\n18.6 Disorders of\n\nCirculatory\n\nSystem\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nBODY FLUIDS AND CIRCULATION 279\n\nFibrinogens are needed for clotting or coagulation of blood. Globulins\n\nprimarly are involved in defense mechanisms of the body and the albumins\n\nhelp in osmotic balance. Plasma also contains small amounts of minerals\n\nlike Na+, Ca++, Mg++, HCO\n3\n–, Cl–, etc. Glucose, amino acids, lipids, etc., are\n\nalso present in the plasma as they are always in transit in the body. Factors\n\nfor coagulation or clotting of blood are also present in the plasma in an\n\ninactive form. Plasma without the clotting factors is called serum.\n\n18.1.2 Formed Elements\n\nErythrocytes, leucocytes and platelets are collectively called formed\n\nelements (Figure 18.1) and they constitute nearly 45 per cent of the blood.\n\nErythrocytes or red blood cells (RBC) are the most abundant of all\n\nthe cells in blood. A healthy adult man has, on an average, 5 millions to\n\n5.5 millions of RBCs mm–3 of blood. RBCs are formed in the red bone\n\nmarrow in the adults. RBCs are devoid of nucleus in most of the mammals\n\nand are biconcave in shape. They have a red coloured, iron containing\n\ncomplex protein called haemoglobin, hence the colour and name of these\n\ncells. A healthy individual has 12-16 gms of haemoglobin in every\n\n100 ml of blood. These molecules play a significant role in transport of\n\nrespiratory gases. RBCs have an average life span of 120 days after which\n\nthey are destroyed in the spleen (graveyard of RBCs).\n\nLeucocytes are also known as white blood cells (WBC) as they are\n\ncolourless due to the lack of haemoglobin. They are nucleated and are\n\nrelatively lesser in number which averages 6000-8000 mm–3 of blood.\n\nLeucocytes are generally short lived. We have two main categories of WBCs\n\n– granulocytes and agranulocytes. Neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils\n\nare different types of granulocytes, while lymphocytes and monocytes\n\nare the agranulocytes. Neutrophils are the most abundant cells (60-65\n\nper cent) of the total WBCs and basophils are the least (0.5-1 per cent)\n\namong them. Neutrophils and monocytes (6-8 per cent) are phagocytic\n\ncells which destroy foreign organisms entering the body. Basophils secrete\n\nhistamine, serotonin, heparin, etc., and are involved in inflammatory\n\nreactions. Eosinophils (2-3 per cent) resist infections and are also\n\nR B C\n\nPlatelets\n\nEosinophil\n\nBasophil\n\nNeutrophil\n\nMonocyte\n\nT lymphocyte\n\nB lymphocyte\n\nFigure 18.1 Diagrammatic representation of formed elements in blood\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n280 BIOLOGY\n\nassociated with allergic reactions. Lymphocytes (20-25 per cent) are of\n\ntwo major types – ‘B’ and ‘T’ forms. Both B and T lymphocytes are\n\nresponsible for immune responses of the body.\n\nPlatelets also called thrombocytes, are cell fragments produced from\n\nmegakaryocytes (special cells in the bone marrow). Blood normally\n\ncontains 1,500,00-3,500,00 platelets mm–3. Platelets can release a variety\n\nof substances most of which are involved in the coagulation or clotting of\n\nblood. A reduction in their number can lead to clotting disorders which\n\nwill lead to excessive loss of blood from the body.\n\n18.1.3 Blood Groups\n\nAs you know, blood of human beings differ in certain aspects though it\n\nappears to be similar. Various types of grouping of blood has been done.\n\nTwo such groupings – the ABO and Rh – are widely used all over the\n\nworld.\n\n18.1.3.1 ABO grouping\n\nABO grouping is based on the presence or absence of two surface antigens\n\n(chemicals that can induce immune response) on the RBCs namely A\n\nand B. Similarly, the plasma of different individuals contain two natural\n\nantibodies (proteins produced in response to antigens). The distribution\n\nof antigens and antibodies in the four groups of blood, A, B, AB and O\n\nare given in Table 18.1. You probably know that during blood transfusion,\n\nany blood cannot be used; the blood of a donor has to be carefully matched\n\nwith the blood of a recipient before any blood transfusion to avoid severe\n\nproblems of clumping (destruction of RBC). The donor’s compatibility is\n\nalso shown in the Table 18.1.\n\nBlood Group Antigens on Antibodies Donor’s Group\nRBCs in Plasma\n\nA A anti-B A, O\n\nB B anti-A B, O\n\nAB A, B nil AB, A, B, O\n\nO nil anti-A, B O\n\nTABLE 18.1  Blood Groups and Donor Compatibility\n\nFrom the above mentioned table it is evident that group ‘O’ blood can\n\nbe donated to persons with any other blood group and hence ‘O’ group\n\nindividuals are called ‘universal donors’. Persons with ‘AB’ group can\n\naccept blood from persons with AB as well as the other groups of blood.\n\nTherefore, such persons are called ‘universal recipients’.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nBODY FLUIDS AND CIRCULATION 281\n\n18.1.3.2 Rh grouping\n\nAnother antigen, the Rh antigen similar to one present in Rhesus monkeys\n\n(hence Rh), is also observed on the surface of RBCs of majority (nearly 80\n\nper cent) of humans. Such individuals are called Rh positive (Rh+ve)\n\nand those in whom this antigen is absent are called Rh negative (Rh-ve).\n\nAn Rh-ve person, if exposed to Rh+ve blood, will form specific antibodies\n\nagainst the Rh antigens. Therefore, Rh group should also be matched\n\nbefore transfusions. A special case of Rh incompatibility (mismatching)\n\nhas been observed between the Rh-ve blood of a pregnant mother with\n\nRh+ve blood of the foetus. Rh antigens of the foetus do not get exposed to\n\nthe Rh-ve blood of the mother in the first pregnancy as the two bloods are\n\nwell separated by the placenta. However, during the delivery of the first\n\nchild, there is a possibility of exposure of the maternal blood to small\n\namounts of the Rh+ve blood from the foetus. In such cases, the mother\n\nstarts preparing antibodies against Rh antigen in her blood. In case of\n\nher subsequent pregnancies, the Rh antibodies from the mother (Rh-ve)\n\ncan leak into the blood of the foetus (Rh+ve) and destroy the foetal RBCs.\n\nThis could be fatal to the foetus or could cause severe anaemia and\n\njaundice to the baby. This condition is called erythroblastosis foetalis.\n\nThis can be avoided by administering anti-Rh antibodies to the mother\n\nimmediately after the delivery of the first child.\n\n18.1.4 Coagulation of Blood\n\nYou know that when you cut your finger or hurt yourself, your wound\n\ndoes not continue to bleed for a long time; usually the blood stops flowing\n\nafter sometime. Do you know why? Blood exhibits coagulation or clotting\n\nin response to an injury or trauma. This is a mechanism to prevent\n\nexcessive loss of blood from the body. You would have observed a dark\n\nreddish brown scum formed at the site of a cut or an injury over a period\n\nof time. It is a clot or coagulam formed mainly of a network of threads\n\ncalled fibrins in which dead and damaged formed elements of blood are\n\ntrapped. Fibrins are formed by the conversion of inactive fibrinogens in\n\nthe plasma by the enzyme thrombin. Thrombins, in turn are formed from\n\nanother inactive substance present in the plasma called prothrombin. An\n\nenzyme complex, thrombokinase, is required for the above reaction. This\n\ncomplex is formed by a series of linked enzymic reactions (cascade\n\nprocess) involving a number of factors present in the plasma in an inactive\n\nstate. An injury or a trauma stimulates the platelets in the blood to release\n\ncertain factors which activate the mechanism of coagulation. Certain\n\nfactors released by the tissues at the site of injury also can initiate\n\ncoagulation. Calcium ions play a very important role in clotting.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n282 BIOLOGY\n\n18.2 LYMPH (TISSUE FLUID)\n\nAs the blood passes through the capillaries  in tissues, some water along\n\nwith many small water soluble substances move out into the spaces\n\nbetween the cells of tissues leaving the larger proteins and most of the\n\nformed elements in the blood vessels. This fluid released out is called the\n\ninterstitial fluid or tissue fluid. It has the same mineral distribution as\n\nthat in plasma. Exchange of nutrients, gases, etc., between the blood and\n\nthe cells always occur through this fluid. An elaborate network of vessels\n\ncalled the lymphatic system collects this fluid and drains it back to the\n\nmajor veins. The fluid present in the lymphatic system is called the lymph.\n\nLymph is a colourless fluid containing specialised lymphocytes which\n\nare responsible for the immune responses of the body. Lymph is also an\n\nimportant carrier for nutrients, hormones, etc. Fats are absorbed through\n\nlymph in the lacteals present in the intestinal villi.\n\n18.3 CIRCULATORY PATHWAYS\n\nThe circulatory patterns are of two types – open or closed. Open\n\ncirculatory system is present in arthropods and molluscs in which blood\n\npumped by the heart passes through large vessels into open spaces or\n\nbody cavities called sinuses. Annelids and chordates have a closed\n\ncirculatory system in which the blood pumped by the heart is always\n\ncirculated through a closed network of blood vessels. This pattern is\n\nconsidered to be more advantageous as the flow of fluid can be  more\n\nprecisely regulated.\n\nAll vertebrates possess a muscular chambered heart. Fishes have a\n\n2-chambered heart with an atrium and a ventricle. Amphibians and the\n\nreptiles (except crocodiles) have a 3-chambered heart with two atria and a\n\nsingle ventricle, whereas crocodiles, birds and mammals possess a\n\n4-chambered heart with two atria and two ventricles. In fishes the heart\n\npumps out deoxygenated blood which is oxygenated by the gills and\n\nsupplied to the body parts from where deoxygenated blood is returned to\n\nthe heart (single circulation). In amphibians and reptiles, the left atrium\n\nreceives oxygenated blood from the gills/lungs/skin and the right atrium\n\ngets the deoxygenated blood from other body parts. However, they get mixed\n\nup in the single ventricle which pumps out mixed blood (incomplete double\n\ncirculation). In birds and mammals, oxygenated and deoxygenated blood\n\nreceived by the left and right atria respectively passes on to the ventricles of\n\nthe same sides. The ventricles pump it out without any mixing up, i.e., two\n\nseparate circulatory pathways are present in these organisms, hence, these\n\nanimals have double circulation. Let us study the human circulatory\n\nsystem.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nBODY FLUIDS AND CIRCULATION 283\n\n18.3.1 Human Circulatory System\n\nHuman circulatory system, also called the blood vascular system consists\n\nof a muscular chambered heart, a network of closed branching blood\n\nvessels and blood, the fluid which is circulated.\n\nHeart, the mesodermally derived organ, is situated in the thoracic\n\ncavity, in between the two lungs, slightly tilted to the left. It has the size of\n\na clenched fist. It is protected by a double walled membranous bag,\n\npericardium, enclosing the pericardial fluid. Our heart has four\n\nchambers, two relatively small upper  chambers called atria and two larger\n\nlower chambers called ventricles. A thin, muscular wall called the inter-\n\natrial septum separates the right and the left atria, whereas a thick-walled,\n\nthe inter-ventricular septum, separates the left and the right ventricles\n\n(Figure 18.2). The atrium and the ventricle of the same side are also\n\nseparated by a thick fibrous tissue called the atrio-ventricular septum.\n\nHowever, each of these septa are provided with an opening through which\n\nthe two chambers of the  same side are connected. The opening between\n\nthe right atrium and the right ventricle is guarded by a valve formed of\n\nthree  muscular flaps or cusps, the tricuspid valve, whereas a bicuspid\n\nor mitral valve guards the opening between the left atrium and the left\n\nventricle. The openings of the right and the left ventricles into the\n\nFigure 18.2 Section of a human heart\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n284 BIOLOGY\n\npulmonary artery and the aorta respectively are provided with the\n\nsemilunar valves. The valves in the heart allows the flow of blood only in\n\none direction, i.e., from the atria to the ventricles and from the ventricles\n\nto the pulmonary artery or aorta. These valves prevent any backward\n\nflow.\n\nThe entire heart is made of cardiac muscles. The walls of ventricles\n\nare much thicker than that of the atria. A specialised cardiac musculature\n\ncalled the nodal tissue is also distributed in the heart (Figure 18.2). A\n\npatch of this tissue is present in the right upper corner of the right atrium\n\ncalled the sino-atrial node (SAN). Another mass of this tissue is seen in\n\nthe lower left corner of the right atrium close to the atrio-ventricular septum\n\ncalled the atrio-ventricular node (AVN). A bundle of nodal fibres, atrio-\n\nventricular bundle (AV bundle) continues from the AVN which passes\n\nthrough the atrio-ventricular septa to emerge on the top of the inter-\n\nventricular septum and immediately divides into a right and left bundle.\n\nThese branches give rise to minute fibres throughout the ventricular\n\nmusculature of the respective sides and are called purkinje fibres.  The\n\nnodal musculature has the ability to generate action potentials without\n\nany external stimuli, i.e., it is autoexcitable. However, the number of action\n\npotentials that could be generated in a minute vary at different parts of\n\nthe nodal system. The SAN can generate the maximum number of action\n\npotentials, i.e., 70-75 min–1, and is responsible for initiating and\n\nmaintaining the rhythmic contractile activity of the heart. Therefore, it is\n\ncalled the pacemaker. Our heart normally beats 70-75 times in a minute\n\n(average 72 beats min–1).\n\n18.3.2 Cardiac Cycle\n\nHow does the heart function? Let us take a look. To begin with, all the\n\nfour chambers of heart are in a relaxed state, i.e., they are in  joint\n\ndiastole. As the tricuspid and bicuspid valves are open, blood from the\n\npulmonary veins and vena cava flows into the left and the right ventricle\n\nrespectively through the left and right atria. The semilunar valves are\n\nclosed at this stage. The SAN now generates an action potential which\n\nstimulates both the atria to undergo a simultaneous contraction – the\n\natrial systole. This increases the flow of blood into the ventricles by about\n\n30 per cent. The action potential is conducted to the ventricular side by\n\nthe AVN and AV bundle from where the bundle of His transmits it through\n\nthe entire ventricular musculature. This causes the ventricular muscles\n\nto contract,  (ventricular systole), the atria undergoes relaxation\n\n(diastole), coinciding with the ventricular systole. Ventricular systole\n\nincreases the ventricular pressure causing the closure of tricuspid and\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nBODY FLUIDS AND CIRCULATION 285\n\nbicuspid valves due to attempted backflow of blood into the atria. As\n\nthe ventricular pressure increases further, the semilunar valves guarding\n\nthe pulmonary artery (right side) and the aorta (left side) are forced open,\n\nallowing the blood in the ventricles to flow through these vessels into\n\nthe circulatory pathways. The ventricles now relax (ventricular diastole)\n\nand the ventricular pressure falls causing the closure of semilunar valves\n\nwhich prevents the backflow of blood into the ventricles. As the\n\nventricular pressure declines further, the tricuspid and bicuspid valves\n\nare pushed open by the pressure in the atria exerted by the blood which\n\nwas being emptied into them by the veins. The blood now once again\n\nmoves freely to the ventricles. The ventricles and atria are now again in\n\na relaxed (joint diastole) state, as earlier. Soon the SAN generates a new\n\naction potential and the events described above are repeated in that\n\nsequence and the process continues.\n\nThis sequential event in the heart which is cyclically repeated is called\n\nthe cardiac cycle and it consists of systole and diastole of both the atria\n\nand ventricles. As mentioned earlier, the heart beats 72 times  per minute,\n\ni.e., that many cardiac cycles are performed per minute. From this it could\n\nbe deduced that the duration of a cardiac cycle is 0.8 seconds. During a\n\ncardiac cycle, each ventricle pumps out approximately 70 mL of blood\n\nwhich is called the stroke volume. The stroke volume multiplied by the\n\nheart rate (no. of beats per min.) gives the cardiac output. Therefore, the\n\ncardiac output can be defined as the volume of blood pumped out by each\n\nventricle per minute and averages 5000 mL or 5 litres in a healthy individual.\n\nThe body has the ability to alter the stroke volume as well as the heart rate\n\nand thereby the cardiac output. For example, the cardiac output of an\n\nathlete will be much higher than that of an ordinary man.\n\nDuring each cardiac cycle two prominent sounds are produced which\n\ncan be easily heard through a stethoscope. The first heart sound (lub) is\n\nassociated with the closure of the tricuspid and bicuspid valves whereas\n\nthe second heart sound (dub) is associated with the closure of the\n\nsemilunar valves. These sounds are of clinical diagnostic significance.\n\n18.3.3 Electrocardiograph (ECG)\n\nYou are probably familiar with this scene from a typical hospital television\n\nshow: A patient is hooked up to a monitoring machine that shows voltage\n\ntraces on a screen and makes the sound “... pip... pip... pip.....\n\npeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee” as the patient goes into cardiac arrest. This type\n\nof machine (electro-cardiograph) is used to obtain an electrocardiogram\n\n(ECG). ECG is a graphical representation of the electrical activity of the\n\nheart during a cardiac cycle. To obtain a standard ECG (as shown in the\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n286 BIOLOGY\n\nFigure 18.3), a patient is connected to the\n\nmachine  with three electrical leads (one to each\n\nwrist and to the left ankle) that continuously\n\nmonitor the heart activity. For a detailed\n\nevaluation of the heart’s function, multiple\n\nleads are attached to the chest region. Here,\n\nwe will talk only about a standard ECG.\n\nEach peak in the ECG is identified with a\n\nletter from P to T that corresponds to a specific\n\nelectrical activity of the heart.\n\nThe P-wave represents the electrical\n\nexcitation (or depolarisation) of the atria,\n\nwhich leads to the contraction of both the atria.\nThe QRS complex represents the depolarisation of the ventricles,\n\nwhich initiates the ventricular contraction. The contraction starts shortly\n\nafter Q and marks the beginning of the systole.\n\nThe T-wave represents the return of the ventricles from excited to normal\n\nstate (repolarisation). The end of the T-wave marks the end of systole.\n\nObviously, by counting the number of QRS complexes that occur in a\n\ngiven time period, one can determine the heart beat rate of an individual.\n\nSince the ECGs obtained from different individuals have roughly the same\n\nshape for a given lead configuration, any deviation from this shape indicates\n\na possible abnormality or disease. Hence, it is of a great clinical significance.\n\n18.4 DOUBLE CIRCULATION\n\nThe blood flows strictly by a fixed route through Blood Vessels—the\n\narteries and veins. Basically, each artery and vein consists of three layers:\n\nan inner lining of squamous endothelium, the tunica intima, a middle\n\nlayer of smooth muscle and elastic fibres, the tunica media, and an\n\nexternal layer of fibrous connective tissue with collagen fibres, the tunica\n\nexterna. The tunica media is comparatively thin in the veins (Figure\n\n18.4).\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the blood pumped by the right ventricle enters\n\nthe pulmonary artery, whereas the left ventricle pumps blood  into the\n\naorta. The deoxygenated blood pumped into the pulmonary artery is\n\npassed on to the lungs  from where the oxygenated blood is carried by\n\nthe pulmonary veins into the left atrium. This pathway constitutes the\n\npulmonary circulation. The oxygenated blood entering the aorta is\n\ncarried by a network of arteries, arterioles and capillaries to the tissues\n\nfrom where the deoxygenated blood is collected by a system of venules,\n\nveins and vena cava and emptied into the right atrium. This is the\n\nsystemic circulation (Figure 18.4).  The systemic circulation provides\n\nnutrients, O\n2\n and other essential substances to the tissues and takes\n\nCO\n2\n and other harmful substances away for elimination. A unique\n\nvascular connection exists between the digestive tract and liver called\n\nFigure 18.3 Diagrammatic presentation of a\nstandard ECG\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nBODY FLUIDS AND CIRCULATION 287\n\nhepatic portal system. The hepatic portal vein carries blood from intestine\n\nto the liver before it is delivered to the systemic circulation. A special\n\ncoronary system of blood vessels is present in our body exclusively for\n\nthe circulation of blood to and from the cardiac musculature.\n\n18.5 REGULATION OF CARDIAC ACTIVITY\n\nNormal activities of the heart are regulated intrinsically, i.e., auto regulated\n\nby specialised muscles (nodal tissue), hence the heart is called myogenic.\n\nA special neural centre in the medulla oblangata can moderate the cardiac\n\nfunction through autonomic nervous system (ANS). Neural signals through\n\nthe sympathetic nerves (part of ANS) can increase the rate of heart beat,\n\nthe strength of ventricular contraction and thereby the cardiac output.\n\nOn the other hand, parasympathetic neural signals (another component\n\nof ANS) decrease the rate of heart beat, speed of conduction of action\n\npotential and thereby the cardiac output. Adrenal medullary hormones\n\ncan also increase the cardiac output.\n\n18.6 DISORDERS OF CIRCULATORY SYSTEM\n\nHigh Blood Pressure (Hypertension): Hypertension is the term for blood\n\npressure that is higher than normal (120/80). In this measurement 120\n\nmm Hg (millimetres of mercury pressure) is the systolic, or pumping,\n\npressure and  80 mm Hg is the diastolic, or resting, pressure. If repeated\n\nchecks of blood pressure of an individual is 140/90 (140 over 90) or\n\nFigure 18.4 Schematic plan of blood circulation in human\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n288 BIOLOGY\n\nhigher, it shows hypertension. High blood pressure leads to heart diseases\n\nand also affects vital organs like brain and kidney.\n\nCoronary Artery Disease (CAD): Coronary Artery Disease, often referred\n\nto as atherosclerosis, affects the vessels that supply blood to the heart\n\nmuscle. It is caused by deposits of calcium, fat, cholesterol and fibrous\n\ntissues, which makes the lumen of arteries narrower.\n\nAngina: It is also called ‘angina pectoris’. A symptom of acute chest pain\n\nappears when no enough oxygen is reaching the heart muscle. Angina\n\ncan occur in men and women of any age but it is more common among\n\nthe middle-aged and elderly. It occurs due to conditions that affect the\n\nblood flow.\n\nHeart Failure: Heart failure means the state of heart when it is not pumping\n\nblood effectively enough to meet the needs of the body. It is sometimes\n\ncalled congestive heart failure because congestion of the lungs is one of\n\nthe main symptoms of this disease. Heart failure is not the same as cardiac\n\narrest (when the heart stops beating) or a heart attack (when the heart\n\nmuscle is suddenly damaged by an inadequate blood supply).\n\nSUMMARY\n\nVertebrates circulate blood, a fluid connective tissue, in their body, to transport essential\n\nsubstances to the cells and to carry waste substances from there. Another fluid, lymph\n\n(tissue fluid) is also used for the transport of certain substances.\n\nBlood comprises of a fluid matrix, plasma and formed elements. Red blood cells (RBCs,\n\nerythrocytes), white blood cells (WBCs, leucocytes) and platelets (thrombocytes) constitute\n\nthe formed elements. Blood of humans are grouped into A, B, AB and O systems based\n\non the presence or absence of two surface antigens, A, B on the RBCs. Another blood\n\ngrouping is also done based on the presence or absence of another antigen called Rhesus\n\nfactor (Rh) on the surface of RBCs. The spaces between cells in the tissues contain a fluid\n\nderived from blood called tissue fluid. This fluid called lymph is almost similar to blood\n\nexcept for the protein content and the formed elements.\n\nAll vertebrates and a few invertebrates have a closed circulatory system. Our circulatory\n\nsystem consists of a muscular pumping organ, heart, a network of vessels and a fluid, blood.\n\nHeart has two atria and two ventricles. Cardiac musculature is auto-excitable. Sino-atrial node\n\n(SAN) generates the maximum number of action protentials per minute (70-75/min) and\n\ntherefore, it sets the pace of the activities of the heart. Hence it is called the Pacemaker. The\n\naction potential causes the atria and then the ventricles to undergo contraction (systole) followed\n\nby their relaxation (diastole). The systole forces the blood to move from the atria to the ventricles\n\nand to the pulmonary artery and the aorta. The cardiac cycle is formed by sequential events in\n\nthe heart which is cyclically repeated and is called the cardiac cycle. A healthy person shows 72\n\nsuch cycles per minute. About 70 mL of blood is pumped out by each ventricle during a\n\ncardiac cycle and it is called the stroke or beat volume. Volume of blood pumped out by each\n\nventricle of heart per minute is called the cardiac output and it is equal to the product of stroke\n\nvolume and heart rate (approx 5 litres). The electrical activity of the heart can be recorded from\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nBODY FLUIDS AND CIRCULATION 289\n\nthe body surface by using electrocardiograph and the recording is called\n\nelectrocardiogram (ECG) which is of clinical importance.\n\nWe have a complete double circulation, i.e., two circulatory pathways, namely,\n\npulmonary and systemic are present. The pulmonary circulation starts by the\n\npumping of deoxygenated blood by the right ventricle which is carried to the lungs\n\nwhere it is oxygenated and returned to the left atrium. The systemic circulation\n\nstarts with the pumping of oxygenated blood by the left ventricle to the aorta\n\nwhich is carried to all the body tissues and the deoxygenated blood from there is\n\ncollected by the veins and returned to the right atrium. Though the heart is\n\nautoexcitable, its functions can be moderated by neural and hormonal mechanisms.\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1.

These substances have\n\nto be removed totally or partially. In this chapter, you will learn the\n\nmechanisms of elimination of these substances with special emphasis on\n\ncommon nitrogenous wastes. Ammonia, urea and uric acid are the major\n\nforms of nitrogenous wastes excreted by the animals. Ammonia is the\n\nmost toxic form and requires large amount of water for its elimination,\n\nwhereas uric acid, being the least toxic, can be removed with a minimum\n\nloss of water.\n\nThe process of excreting ammonia is Ammonotelism. Many bony fishes,\n\naquatic amphibians and aquatic insects are ammonotelic in nature.\n\nAmmonia, as it is readily soluble, is generally excreted by diffusion across\n\nbody surfaces or through gill surfaces (in fish) as ammonium ions. Kidneys\n\ndo not play any significant role in its removal. Terrestrial adaptation\n\nnecessitated the production of lesser toxic nitrogenous wastes like urea\n\nand uric acid for conservation of water. Mammals, many terrestrial\n\namphibians and marine fishes mainly excrete urea and are called ureotelic\n\nanimals. Ammonia produced by metabolism is converted into urea in the\n\nliver of these animals and released into the blood which is filtered and\n\nexcreted out by the kidneys. Some amount of urea may be retained in the\n\nkidney matrix of some of these animals to maintain a desired osmolarity.\n\nReptiles, birds, land snails and insects excrete nitrogenous wastes as uric\n\nacid in the form of pellet or paste with a minimum loss of water and are\n\ncalled uricotelic animals.\n\nEXCRETORY PRODUCTS AND\nTHEIR ELIMINATION\n\nCHAPTER  19\n\n19.1 Human\n\nExcretory\n\nSystem\n\n19.2 Urine Formation\n\n19.3 Function of the\n\nTubules\n\n19.4 Mechanism of\n\nConcentration of\n\nthe Filtrate\n\n19.5 Regulation of\n\nKidney Function\n\n19.6 Micturition\n\n19.7 Role of other\n\nOrgans in\n\nExcretion\n\n19.8 Disorders of the\n\nExcretory\n\nSystem\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nEXCRETORY PRODUCTS AND THEIR ELIMINATION 291\n\nA survey of animal kingdom presents a variety of excretory structures.\n\nIn most of the invertebrates, these structures  are simple tubular forms\n\nwhereas vertebrates have complex tubular organs called kidneys. Some\n\nof these structures are mentioned here. Protonephridia or flame cells are\n\nthe excretory structures in Platyhelminthes (Flatworms, e.g., Planaria),\n\nrotifers, some annelids and the cephalochordate – Amphioxus.\n\nProtonephridia are primarily concerned with ionic and fluid volume\n\nregulation, i.e., osmoregulation. Nephridia are the tubular excretory\n\nstructures of earthworms and other annelids. Nephridia help to remove\n\nnitrogenous wastes and maintain a fluid and ionic balance. Malpighian\n\ntubules are the excretory structures of most of the insects including\n\ncockroaches. Malpighian tubules help in the removal of nitrogenous\n\nwastes and osmoregulation. Antennal glands or green glands perform\n\nthe excretory function in crustaceans like prawns.\n\n19.1 HUMAN EXCRETORY SYSTEM\n\nIn humans, the excretory system consists\n\nof a pair of kidneys, one pair of ureters, a\n\nurinary bladder and a urethra (Figure\n\n19.1). Kidneys are reddish brown, bean\n\nshaped structures situated between the\n\nlevels of last thoracic and third lumbar\n\nvertebra close to the dorsal inner wall of\n\nthe abdominal cavity. Each kidney of an\n\nadult human measures 10-12 cm in\n\nlength, 5-7 cm in width, 2-3 cm in\n\nthickness with an average weight of 120-\n\n170 g. Towards the centre of the inner\n\nconcave surface of the kidney is a notch\n\ncalled hilum through which ureter, blood\n\nvessels and nerves enter. Inner to the hilum\n\nis a broad funnel shaped space called the\n\nrenal pelvis with projections called calyces.\n\nThe outer layer of kidney is a tough\n\ncapsule. Inside the kidney, there are two\n\nzones, an outer cortex and an inner\n\nmedulla. The medulla is divided into a few\n\nconical masses (medullary pyramids)\n\nprojecting into the calyces (sing.: calyx).\n\nThe cortex extends in between the\n\nFigure 19.1 Human Urinary system\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n292 BIOLOGY\n\nFigure 19.3 A diagrammatic representation of a nephron showing blood vessels,\nduct and tubule\n\nmedullary pyramids as renal columns called\n\nColumns of Bertini (Figure 19.2).\n\nEach kidney has nearly one million\n\ncomplex tubular structures called nephrons\n\n(Figure 19.3), which are the functional units.\n\nEach nephron has two parts – the\n\nglomerulus and the renal tubule.\n\nGlomerulus is a tuft of capillaries formed by\n\nthe afferent arteriole – a fine branch of renal\n\nartery. Blood from the glomerulus is carried\n\naway by an efferent arteriole.\n\nThe renal tubule begins with a double\n\nwalled cup-like structure called Bowman’s\n\ncapsule, which encloses the glomerulus.\n\nGlomerulus alongwith Bowman’s capsule, is\n\ncalled the malpighian body or renal\n\ncorpuscle (Figure 19.4). The tubule\n\ncontinues further to form a highly coiled\n\nnetwork – proximal convoluted tubule\n\nFigure 19.2 Longitudinal section (Diagrammatic)\nof Kidney\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nEXCRETORY PRODUCTS AND THEIR ELIMINATION 293\n\n(PCT). A hairpin shaped Henle’s loop is the\n\nnext part of the tubule which has a\n\ndescending and an ascending limb. The\n\nascending limb continues as another highly\n\ncoiled tubular region called distal\n\nconvoluted tubule (DCT). The DCTs of many\n\nnephrons open into a straight tube called\n\ncollecting duct, many of which converge and\n\nopen into the renal pelvis through medullary\n\npyramids in the calyces.\n\nThe Malpighian corpuscle, PCT and DCT\n\nof the nephron are situated in the cortical\n\nregion of the kidney whereas the loop of Henle\n\ndips into the medulla. In majority of\n\nnephrons, the loop of Henle is too short and\n\nextends only very little into the medulla. Such\n\nnephrons are called cortical nephrons. In\n\nsome of the nephrons, the loop of Henle is\n\nvery long and runs deep into the medulla.\n\nThese nephrons are called juxta medullary\n\nnephrons.\n\nThe efferent arteriole emerging from the glomerulus forms a fine\n\ncapillary network around the renal tubule called the peritubular\n\ncapillaries. A minute vessel of this network runs parallel to the Henle’s\n\nloop forming a ‘U’ shaped vasa recta.  Vasa recta is absent or highly\n\nreduced in cortical nephrons.\n\n19.2 URINE FORMATION\n\nUrine formation involves three main processes namely, glomerular\n\nfiltration, reabsorption and secretion, that takes place in different parts of\n\nthe nephron.\n\nThe first step in urine formation is the filtration of blood, which is carried\n\nout by the glomerulus and is called glomerular filtration. On an average,\n\n1100-1200 ml of blood is filtered by the kidneys per minute which constitute\n\nroughly 1/5th of the blood pumped out by each ventricle of the heart in a\n\nminute. The glomerular capillary blood pressure causes filtration of blood\n\nthrough 3 layers, i.e., the endothelium of glomerular blood vessels, the\n\nepithelium of Bowman’s capsule and a basement membrane between these\n\ntwo layers. The epithelial cells of Bowman’s capsule called podocytes are\n\narranged in an intricate manner so as to leave some minute spaces called\n\nfiltration slits or slit pores. Blood is filtered so finely through these\n\nmembranes, that almost all the constituents of the plasma except the\n\nproteins pass onto the lumen of the Bowman’s capsule. Therefore, it is\n\nconsidered as a process of ultra filtration.\n\nAfferent arteriole\n\nEfferent\n\narteriole\n\nBowman’s\ncapsule\n\nProximal\nconvoluted tubule\n\nFigure 19.4 Malpighian body (renal corpuscle)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n294 BIOLOGY\n\nThe amount of the filtrate formed by the kidneys per minute is called\n\nglomerular filtration rate (GFR). GFR in a healthy individual is\n\napproximately 125 ml/minute, i.e., 180 litres per day !\n\nThe kidneys have built-in mechanisms for the regulation of glomerular\n\nfiltration rate. One such efficient mechanism is carried out by juxta\n\nglomerular apparatus (JGA). JGA is a special sensitive region formed by\n\ncellular modifications in the distal convoluted tubule and the afferent\n\narteriole at the location of their contact. A fall in GFR can activate the JG\n\ncells to release renin which can stimulate the glomerular blood flow and\n\nthereby the GFR back to normal.\n\nA comparison of the volume of the filtrate formed per day (180 litres\n\nper day) with that of the urine released (1.5 litres), suggest that nearly 99\n\nper cent of the filtrate has to be reabsorbed by the renal tubules. This\n\nprocess is called reabsorption. The tubular epithelial cells in different\n\nsegments of nephron perform this either by active or passive mechanisms.\n\nFor example, substances like glucose, amino acids, Na+, etc., in the filtrate\n\nare reabsorbed actively whereas the nitrogenous wastes are absorbed by\n\npassive transport. Reabsorption of water also occurs passively in the initial\n\nsegments of the nephron (Figure 19.5).\n\nDuring urine formation, the tubular cells secrete substances like H+,\n\nK+ and ammonia into the filtrate. Tubular secretion is also an important\n\nstep in urine formation as it helps in the maintenance of ionic and acid\n\nbase balance of body fluids.\n\n19.3 FUNCTION OF THE TUBULES\n\nProximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT): PCT is lined by simple cuboidal\n\nbrush border epithelium which increases the surface area for reabsorption.\n\nNearly all of the essential nutrients, and 70-80 per cent of electrolytes\n\nand water are reabsorbed by this segment. PCT also helps to maintain\n\nthe pH and ionic balance of the body fluids by selective secretion of\n\nhydrogen ions and ammonia into the filtrate and by absorption of\n\nHCO\n3\n– from it.\n\nHenle’s Loop: Reabsorption is minimum in its ascending limb.\n\nHowever, this region plays a significant role in the maintenance of high\n\nosmolarity of medullary interstitial fluid. The descending limb of loop of\n\nHenle is permeable to water but almost impermeable to electrolytes. This\n\nconcentrates the filtrate as it moves down. The ascending limb is\n\nimpermeable to water but allows transport of electrolytes actively or\n\npassively. Therefore, as the concentrated filtrate pass upward, it gets\n\ndiluted due to the passage of electrolytes to the medullary fluid.\n\nDistal Convoluted Tubule (DCT): Conditional reabsorption of Na+\n\nand water takes place in this segment. DCT is also capable of reabsorption\n\nof HCO\n3\n– and selective secretion of hydrogen and potassium ions and\n\nNH\n3\n to maintain the pH and sodium-potassium balance in blood.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nEXCRETORY PRODUCTS AND THEIR ELIMINATION 295\n\nCollecting Duct: This long duct extends from the cortex of the kidney\n\nto the inner parts of the medulla. Large amounts of water could be\n\nreabsorbed from this region to produce a concentrated urine. This segment\n\nallows passage of small amounts of urea into the medullary interstitium\n\nto keep up the osmolarity. It also plays a role in the maintenance of pH\n\nand ionic balance of blood by the selective secretion of H+ and K+ ions\n\n(Figure 19.5).\n\n19.4 MECHANISM OF CONCENTRATION OF THE FILTRATE\n\nMammals have the ability to produce a concentrated urine. The Henle’s\n\nloop and vasa recta play a significant role in this. The flow of filtrate in\n\nthe two limbs of Henle’s loop is in opposite directions and thus forms a\n\ncounter current. The flow of blood through the two limbs of vasa recta is\n\nFigure 19.5 Reabsorption and secretion of major substances at different parts of\nthe nephron (Arrows indicate direction of movement of materials.)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n296 BIOLOGY\n\nalso in a counter current pattern. The proximity between the Henle’s loop\n\nand vasa recta, as well as the counter current in them help in maintaining\n\nan increasing osmolarity towards the inner medullary interstitium, i.e.,\n\nfrom 300 mOsmolL–1 in the cortex to about 1200 mOsmolL–1 in the inner\n\nmedulla. This gradient is mainly caused by NaCl and urea. NaCl is\n\ntransported by the ascending limb of Henle’s loop which is exchanged\n\nwith the descending limb of vasa recta. NaCl is returned to the interstitium\n\nby the ascending portion of vasa recta. Similarly, small amounts of urea\n\nenter the thin segment of the ascending limb of Henle’s loop which is\n\ntransported back to the interstitium by the collecting tubule. The above\n\ndescribed transport of substances facilitated by the special arrangement\n\nof Henle’s loop and vasa recta is called the counter current mechanism\n\n(Figure. 19.6). This mechanism helps to maintain a concentration gradient\n\nFigure 19.6 Diagrammatic representation of a nephron and vasa recta showing\ncounter current mechanisms\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nEXCRETORY PRODUCTS AND THEIR ELIMINATION 297\n\nin the medullary interstitium. Presence of such interstitial gradient helps\n\nin an easy passage of water from the collecting tubule thereby\n\nconcentrating the filtrate (urine). Human kidneys can produce urine nearly\n\nfour times concentrated than the initial filtrate formed.\n\n19.5 REGULATION OF KIDNEY FUNCTION\n\nThe functioning of the kidneys is efficiently monitored and regulated by\n\nhormonal feedback mechanisms involving the hypothalamus, JGA and\n\nto a certain extent, the heart.\n\nOsmoreceptors in the body are activated by changes in blood volume,\n\nbody fluid volume and ionic concentration. An excessive loss of fluid from\n\nthe body can activate these receptors which stimulate the hypothalamus\n\nto release antidiuretic hormone (ADH) or vasopressin from the\n\nneurohypophysis. ADH facilitates water reabsorption from latter parts of\n\nthe tubule, thereby preventing diuresis. An increase in body fluid volume\n\ncan switch off the osmoreceptors and suppress the ADH release to complete\n\nthe feedback. ADH can also affect the kidney function by its constrictory\n\neffects on blood vessels. This causes an increase in blood pressure. An\n\nincrease in blood pressure can increase the glomerular blood flow and\n\nthereby the GFR.\n\nThe JGA plays a complex regulatory role. A fall in glomerular blood\n\nflow/glomerular blood pressure/GFR can activate the JG cells to release\n\nrenin which converts angiotensinogen in blood to angiotensin I and\n\nfurther to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II, being a powerful\n\nvasoconstrictor, increases the glomerular blood pressure and thereby\n\nGFR. Angiotensin II also activates the adrenal cortex to release\n\nAldosterone. Aldosterone causes reabsorption of Na+ and water from\n\nthe distal parts of the tubule. This also leads to an increase in blood\n\npressure and GFR. This complex mechanism is generally known as\n\nthe Renin-Angiotensin mechanism.\n\nAn increase in blood flow to the atria of the heart can cause the release\n\nof Atrial Natriuretic Factor (ANF). ANF can cause vasodilation (dilation of\n\nblood vessels) and thereby decrease the blood pressure. ANF mechanism,\n\ntherefore, acts as a check on the renin-angiotensin mechanism.\n\n19.6 MICTURITION\n\nUrine formed by the nephrons is ultimately carried to the urinary bladder\n\nwhere it is stored till a voluntary signal is given by the central nervous\n\nsystem (CNS). This signal is initiated by the stretching of the urinary bladder\n\nas it gets filled with urine. In response, the stretch receptors on the walls\n\nof the bladder send signals to the CNS. The CNS passes on motor messages\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n298 BIOLOGY\n\nto initiate the contraction of smooth muscles of the bladder and\n\nsimultaneous relaxation of the urethral sphincter causing the release of\n\nurine. The process of release of urine is called micturition and the neural\n\nmechanisms causing it is called the micturition reflex. An adult human\n\nexcretes, on an average, 1 to 1.5 litres of urine per day. The urine formed\n\nis a light yellow coloured watery fluid which is slightly acidic (pH-6.0)\n\nand has a characterestic odour. On an average, 25-30 gm of urea is\n\nexcreted out per day. Various conditions can affect the characteristics of\n\nurine. Analysis of urine helps in clinical diagnosis of many metabolic\n\ndiscorders as well as malfunctioning of the kidney. For example, presence\n\nof glucose (Glycosuria) and ketone bodies (Ketonuria) in urine are\n\nindicative of diabetes mellitus.\n\n19.7 ROLE OF OTHER ORGANS IN EXCRETION\n\nOther than the kidneys, lungs, liver and skin also help in the elimination\n\nof excretory wastes.\n\nOur lungs remove large amounts of CO\n2\n (approximately 200mL/\n\nminute) and also significant quantities of water every day. Liver, the largest\n\ngland in our body, secretes bile-containing substances like bilirubin,\n\nbiliverdin, cholesterol, degraded steroid hormones, vitamins and drugs.\n\nMost of these substances ultimately pass out alongwith digestive wastes.\n\nThe sweat and sebaceous glands in the skin can eliminate certain\n\nsubstances through their secretions. Sweat produced by the sweat\n\nglands is a watery fluid containing NaCl, small amounts of urea, lactic\n\nacid, etc. Though the primary function of sweat is to facilitate a cooling\n\neffect on the body surface, it also helps in the removal of some of the\n\nwastes mentioned above. Sebaceous glands eliminate certain\n\nsubstances like sterols, hydrocarbons and waxes through sebum. This\n\nsecretion provides a protective oily covering for the skin. Do you know\n\nthat small amounts of nitrogenous wastes could be eliminated through\n\nsaliva too?\n\n19.8 DISORDERS OF THE EXCRETORY SYSTEM\n\nMalfunctioning of kidneys can lead to accumulation of urea in blood, a\n\ncondition called uremia, which is highly harmful and may lead to kidney\n\nfailure. In such patients, urea can be removed by a process called\n\nhemodialysis. During the process of haemodialysis, the blood drained\n\nfrom a convenient artery is pumped into a dialysing unit called artificial\n\nkidney. Blood drained from a convenient artery is pumped into a dialysing\n\nunit after adding an anticoagulant like heparin. The unit contains a coiled\n\ncellophane tube surrounded by a fluid (dialysing fluid) having the same\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nEXCRETORY PRODUCTS AND THEIR ELIMINATION 299\n\nSUMMARY\n\nMany nitrogen containing substances, ions, CO\n2\n, water, etc., that accumulate in\n\nthe body have to be eliminated. Nature of nitrogenous wastes formed and their\n\nexcretion vary among animals, mainly depending on the habitat (availability of\n\nwater). Ammonia, urea and uric acid are the major nitrogenous wastes excreted.\n\nProtonephridia, nephridia, malpighian tubules, green glands and the kidneys are\n\nthe common excretory organs in animals. They not only eliminate nitrogenous wastes\n\nbut also help in the maintenance of ionic and acid-base balance of body fluids.\n\nIn humans, the excretory system consists of one pair of kidneys, a pair of ureters,\n\na urinary bladder and a urethra. Each kidney has over a million tubular structures\n\ncalled nephrons. Nephron is the functional unit of kidney and has two portions –\n\nglomerulus and renal tubule. Glomerulus is a tuft of capillaries formed from afferent\n\narterioles, fine branches of renal artery. The renal tubule starts with a double walled\n\nBowman’s capsule and is further differentiated into a proximal convoluted tubule\n\n(PCT), Henle’s loop (HL) and distal convoluted tubule (DCT). The DCTs of many\n\nnephrons join to a common collecting duct many of which ultimately open into the\n\nrenal pelvis through the medullary pyramids. The Bowman’s capsule encloses the\n\nglomerulus to form Malpighian or renal corpuscle.\n\nUrine formation involves three main processes, i.e., filtration, reabsorption and\n\nsecretion. Filtration is a non-selective process performed by the glomerulus using\n\nthe glomerular capillary blood pressure. About 1200 ml of blood is filtered by the\n\nglomerulus per minute to form 125 ml of filtrate in the Bowman’s capsule per\n\ncomposition as that of plasma except the nitrogenous wastes. The porous\n\ncellophane membrance of the tube allows the passage of molecules based\n\non concentration gradient. As nitrogenous wastes are absent in the\n\ndialysing fluid, these substances freely move out, thereby clearing the\n\nblood. The cleared blood is pumped back to the body through a vein\n\nafter adding anti-heparin to it. This method is a boon for thousands of\n\nuremic patients all over the world.\n\nKidney transplantation is the ultimate method in the correction of\n\nacute renal failures (kidney failure). A functioning kidney is used in\n\ntransplantation from a donor, preferably a close relative, to minimise its\n\nchances of rejection by the immune system of the host. Modern clinical\n\nprocedures have increased the success rate of such a complicated\n\ntechnique.\n\nRenal calculi: Stone or insoluble mass of crystallised salts (oxalates,\n\netc.) formed within the kidney.\n\nGlomerulonephritis: Inflammation of glomeruli of kidney.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n300 BIOLOGY\n\nminute (GFR). JGA, a specialised portion of the nephrons, plays a significant role\n\nin the regulation of GFR. Nearly 99 per cent reabsorption of the filtrate takes place\n\nthrough different parts of the nephrons. PCT is the major site of reabsorption and\n\nselective secretion. HL primarily helps to maintain osmolar gradient\n\n(300 mOsmolL–1 -1200 mOsmolL–1) within the kidney interstitium. DCT and\n\ncollecting duct allow extensive reabsorption of water and certain electrolytes, which\n\nhelp in osmoregulation: H+, K+ and NH\n3\n could be secreted into the filtrate by the\n\ntubules to maintain the ionic balance and pH of body fluids.\n\nA counter current mechanism operates between the two limbs of the loop of\n\nHenle and those of vasa recta (capillary parallel to Henle’s loop). The filtrate gets\n\nconcentrated as it moves down the descending limb but is diluted by the ascending\n\nlimb. Electrolytes and urea are retained in the interstitium by this arrangement.\n\nDCT and collecting duct concentrate the filtrate about four times, i.e., from 300\n\nmOsmolL–1 to 1200 mOsmolL–1, an excellent mechanism of conservation of water.\n\nUrine is stored in the urinary bladder till a voluntary signal from CNS carries out\n\nits release through urethra, i.e., micturition. Skin, lungs and liver also assist in\n\nexcretion.\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1. Define Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)\n\n2. Explain the autoregulatory mechanism of GFR.\n\n3.

Animals and\n\nplants exhibit a wide range of movements. Streaming of protoplasm in\n\nthe unicellular organisms like Amoeba is a simple form of movement.\n\nMovement of cilia, flagella and tentacles are shown by many organisms.\n\nHuman beings can move limbs, jaws, eyelids, tongue, etc. Some of the\n\nmovements result in a change of place or location. Such voluntary\n\nmovements are called locomotion. Walking, running, climbing, flying,\n\nswimming are all some forms of locomotory movements. Locomotory\n\nstructures need not be different from those affecting other types of\n\nmovements. For example, in Paramoecium, cilia helps in the movement of\n\nfood through cytopharynx and in locomotion as well. Hydra can use its\n\ntentacles for capturing its prey and also use them for locomotion. We use\n\nlimbs for changes in body postures and locomotion as well. The above\n\nobservations suggest that movements and locomotion cannot be studied\n\nseparately. The two may be linked by stating that all locomotions are\n\nmovements but all movements are not locomotions.\n\nMethods of locomotion performed by animals vary with their habitats\n\nand the demand of the situation. However, locomotion is generally for\n\nsearch of food, shelter, mate, suitable breeding grounds, favourable\n\nclimatic conditions or to escape from enemies/predators.\n\n20.1 TYPES OF MOVEMENT\n\nCells of the human body exhibit three main types of movements, namely,\namoeboid, ciliary and muscular.\n\nLOCOMOTION AND MOVEMENT\n\nCHAPTER  20\n\n20.1 Types of\n\nMovement\n\n20.2 Muscle\n\n20.3 Skeletal System\n\n20.4 Joints\n\n20.5 Disorders of\n\nMuscular and\n\nSkeletal System\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nLOCOMOTION AND MOVEMENT 303\n\nSome specialised cells in our body like macrophages and leucocytes\n\nin blood exhibit amoeboid movement. It is effected by pseudopodia formed\n\nby the streaming of protoplasm (as in Amoeba). Cytoskeletal elements\n\nlike microfilaments are also involved in amoeboid movement.\n\nCiliary movement occurs in most of our internal tubular organs which\n\nare lined by  ciliated epithelium. The coordinated movements of cilia in\n\nthe trachea help us in removing dust particles and some of the foreign\n\nsubstances inhaled alongwith the atmospheric air. Passage of ova through\n\nthe female reproductive tract is also facilitated by the ciliary movement.\n\nMovement of our limbs, jaws, tongue, etc, require muscular movement.\n\nThe contractile property of muscles are effectively used for locomotion\n\nand other movements by human beings and majority of multicellular\n\norganisms. Locomotion requires a perfect coordinated activity of muscular,\n\nskeletal and neural systems. In this chapter, you will learn about the\n\ntypes of muscles, their structure, mechanism of their contraction and\n\nimportant aspects of the skeletal system.\n\n20.2 MUSCLE\n\nYou have studied in Chapter 8 that the cilia and flagella are the outgrowths\n\nof the cell membrane. Flagellar movement helps in the swimming of\n\nspermatozoa, maintenance of water current in the canal system of sponges\n\nand in locomotion of Protozoans like Euglena. Muscle is a specialised\n\ntissue of mesodermal origin. About 40-50 per cent of the body\n\nweight of a human adult is contributed by muscles. They have\n\nspecial properties like excitability, contractility, extensibility and\n\nelasticity. Muscles have been classified using different criteria,\n\nnamely location, appearance and nature of regulation of their\n\nactivities. Based on their location, three types of muscles are\n\nidentified : (i) Skeletal (ii) Visceral and (iii) Cardiac.\n\nSkeletal muscles are closely associated with the skeletal components\n\nof the body. They have a striped appearance under the microscope and\n\nhence are called striated muscles. As their activities are under the\n\nvoluntary control of the nervous system, they are known as voluntary\n\nmuscles too. They are primarily involved in locomotory actions and\n\nchanges of body postures.\n\nVisceral muscles are located in the inner walls of hollow visceral organs\n\nof the body like the alimentary canal, reproductive tract, etc. They do not\n\nexhibit any striation and are smooth in appearance. Hence, they are called\n\nsmooth muscles (nonstriated muscle). Their activities are not under the\n\nvoluntary control of the nervous system and are therefore known as\n\ninvoluntary muscles. They assist, for example, in the transportation of food\n\nthrough the digestive tract and gametes through the genital tract.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n304 BIOLOGY\n\nmuscle fibre is lined by the plasma membrane called sarcolemma\n\nenclosing the sarcoplasm. Muscle fibre is a syncitium as the sarcoplasm\n\ncontains many nuclei. The endoplasmic reticulum, i.e., sarcoplasmic\n\nreticulum of the muscle fibres is the store house of calcium ions. A\n\ncharacteristic feature of the muscle fibre is the presence of a large number\n\nof parallelly arranged filaments in the sarcoplasm called myofilaments or\n\nmyofibrils. Each myofibril has alternate dark and light bands on it. A\n\ndetailed study of the myofibril has established that the striated appearance\n\nis due to the distribution pattern of two important proteins – Actin and\n\nMyosin. The light bands contain actin and is called I-band or Isotropic\n\nband, whereas the dark band called ‘A’ or Anisotropic band contains\n\nAs the name suggests, Cardiac muscles are the muscles of heart.\n\nMany cardiac muscle cells assemble in a branching pattern to form a\n\ncardiac muscle. Based on appearance, cardiac muscles are striated. They\n\nare involuntary in nature as the nervous system does not control their\n\nactivities directly.\n\nLet us examine a skeletal muscle in detail to understand the structure\n\nand mechanism of contraction. Each organised skeletal muscle in our\n\nbody is made of a number of muscle bundles or fascicles held together\n\nby a common collagenous connective tissue layer called fascia. Each\n\nmuscle bundle  contains a number of muscle fibres (Figure 20.1). Each\n\nFascicle\n(muscle bundle)\n\nMuscle fibre\n(muscle cell)\n\nSarcolemma\n\nBlood capillary\n\nFigure 20.1 Diagrammatic cross sectional view of a muscle showing muscle bundles\nand muscle fibres\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nLOCOMOTION AND MOVEMENT 305\n\nmyosin. Both the proteins are arranged as rod-like structures, parallel to\n\neach other and also to the longitudinal axis of the myofibrils. Actin\n\nfilaments are thinner as compared to the myosin filaments, hence are\n\ncommonly called thin and thick filaments respectively. In the centre of\n\neach ‘I’ band is an elastic fibre called ‘Z’ line which bisects it. The thin\n\nfilaments are firmly attached to the ‘Z’ line. The thick filaments in the\n\n‘A’ band are also held together in the middle of this band by a thin fibrous\n\nmembrane called ‘M’ line. The ‘A’ and ‘I’ bands are arranged alternately\n\nthroughout the length of the myofibrils. The portion of the myofibril\n\nbetween two successive ‘Z’ lines is considered as the functional unit of\n\ncontraction and is called a sarcomere (Figure 20.2). In a resting state, the\n\nedges of thin filaments on either side of the thick filaments partially overlap\n\nthe free ends of the thick filaments leaving the central part of the thick\n\nfilaments. This central part of thick filament, not overlapped by thin\n\nfilaments is called the ‘H’ zone.\n\nFigure 20.2 Diagrammatic representation of (a) anatomy of a muscle fibre showing\na sarcomere (b) a sarcomere\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n306 BIOLOGY\n\n20.2.1 Structure of Contractile Proteins\n\nEach actin (thin) filament is made of two ‘F’ (filamentous) actins\n\nhelically wound to each other. Each ‘F’ actin is a polymer of monomeric\n\n‘G’ (Globular) actins. Two filaments of another protein, tropomyosin\n\nalso run close to the ‘F’ actins throughout its length. A complex protein\n\nTroponin is distributed at regular intervals on the tropomyosin. In the\n\nresting state a subunit of troponin masks the active binding sites for\n\nmyosin on the actin filaments (Figure 20.3a).\n\nEach myosin (thick) filament is also a polymerised protein. Many\n\nmonomeric proteins called Meromyosins (Figure 20.3b) constitute one\n\nthick filament. Each meromyosin has two important parts, a globular\n\nhead with a short arm and a tail, the former being called the heavy\n\nmeromyosin (HMM) and the latter, the light meromyosin (LMM). The HMM\n\ncomponent, i.e.; the head and short arm projects outwards at regular\n\ndistance and angle from each other from the surface of a polymerised myosin\n\nfilament and is known as cross arm. The globular head is an active ATPase\n\nenzyme and has binding sites for ATP and active sites for actin.\n\nFigure 20.3 (a) An actin (thin) filament (b) Myosin monomer (Meromyosin)\n\nActin binding sites\n\nATP binding sites\nHead\n\nCross arm\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n20.2.2 Mechanism of Muscle Contraction\n\nMechanism of muscle contraction is best explained by the sliding filament\n\ntheory which states that contraction of a muscle fibre takes place by the\n\nsliding of the thin filaments over the thick filaments.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nLOCOMOTION AND MOVEMENT 307\n\nMuscle contraction is initiated by a signal sent by the central nervous\n\nsystem (CNS) via a motor neuron. A motor neuron alongwith the muscle\n\nfibres connected to it constitute a motor unit. The junction between a\n\nmotor neuron and the sarcolemma of the muscle fibre is called the\n\nneuromuscular junction or motor-end plate. A neural signal reaching\n\nthis junction releases a neurotransmitter (Acetyl choline) which generates\n\nan action potential in the sarcolemma. This spreads through the muscle\n\nfibre and causes the release of calcium ions into the sarcoplasm. Increase\n\nin Ca++ level leads to the binding of calcium with a subunit of troponin on\n\nactin filaments and thereby remove the masking of active sites for myosin.\n\nUtilising the energy from ATP hydrolysis, the myosin head now binds to\n\nthe exposed active sites on actin to form a cross bridge (Figure 20.4). This\n\npulls the attached actin filaments towards the centre of ‘A’ band. The\n\n‘Z’ line attached to these actins are also pulled inwards thereby causing a\n\nshortening of the sarcomere, i.e., contraction. It is clear from the above\n\nsteps, that during shortening of the muscle, i.e., contraction, the ‘I’ bands\n\nget reduced, whereas the ‘A’ bands retain the length (Figure 20.5). The\n\nmyosin, releasing the ADP and P\n1\n goes back to its relaxed state. A new\n\nATP binds and the cross-bridge is broken (Figure 20.4). The ATP is again\n\nhydrolysed by the myosin head and the cycle of cross bridge formation\n\nFigure 20.4 Stages in cross bridge formation, rotation of head and breaking of\ncross bridge\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n308 BIOLOGY\n\nand breakage is repeated causing further sliding. The process continues\n\ntill the Ca++ ions are pumped back to the sarcoplasmic cisternae resulting\n\nin the masking of actin filaments. This causes the return of ‘Z’ lines back\n\nto their original position, i.e., relaxation. The reaction time of the fibres\n\ncan vary in different muscles. Repeated activation of the muscles can lead\n\nto the accumulation of lactic acid due to anaerobic breakdown of glycogen\n\nin them, causing fatigue. Muscle contains a red coloured oxygen storing\n\npigment called myoglobin. Myoglobin content is high in some of the\n\nmuscles which gives a reddish appearance. Such muscles are called the\n\nRed fibres. These muscles also contain plenty of mitochondria which can\n\nutilise the large amount of oxygen stored in them for ATP production.\n\nThese muscles, therefore, can also be called aerobic muscles. On the\n\nother hand, some of the muscles possess very less quantity of myoglobin\n\nand therefore, appear pale or whitish. These are the White fibres. Number\n\nof mitochondria are also few in them, but the amount of sarcoplasmic\n\nreticulum is high. They depend on anaerobic process for energy.\n\nFigure 20.5 Sliding-filament theory of muscle contraction (movement of the thin\nfilaments and the relative size of the I band and H zones)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nLOCOMOTION AND MOVEMENT 309\n\n20.3 SKELETAL SYSTEM\n\nSkeletal system consists of a framework of bones and a few cartilages.\n\nThis system has a significant role in movement shown by the body.\n\nImagine chewing food without  jaw bones and walking around without\n\nthe limb bones. Bone and cartilage are specialised connective tissues.\n\nThe former has a very hard matrix due to calcium salts in it and the latter\n\nhas slightly pliable matrix due to chondroitin salts. In human beings,\n\nthis system is made up of 206 bones and a few cartilages. It is grouped\n\ninto two principal divisions – the axial and the appendicular skeleton.\n\nAxial skeleton comprises 80 bones distributed along the main axis\n\nof the body. The skull, vertebral column, sternum and ribs constitute\n\naxial skeleton. The skull (Figure 20.6) is composed of two sets of bones –\n\ncranial and facial, that totals to 22 bones. Cranial bones are 8 in number.\n\nThey form the hard protective outer covering, cranium for the brain. The\n\nfacial region is made up of 14 skeletal elements which form the front part\n\nof the skull. A single U-shaped bone called hyoid is present at the base of\n\nthe buccal cavity and it is also included in the skull. Each middle ear\n\ncontains three tiny bones – Malleus, Incus and Stapes, collectively called\n\nEar Ossicles. The skull region articulates with the superior region of the\n\nParietal\nbone\n\nFrontal bone\n\nTemporal\nbone\n\nOccipital\nbone\n\nOccipital\ncondyle\n\nSphenoid bone\n\nEthmoid bone\n\nLacrimal bone\n\nNasal bone\n\nZygomatic bone\n\nMaxilla\n\nMandible\n\nHyoid bone\n\nFigure 20.6 Diagrammatic view of human skull\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n310 BIOLOGY\n\nvertebral column with the help of two occipital\n\ncondyles (dicondylic skull).\n\nOur vertebral column (Figure 20.7) is\n\nformed by 26 serially arranged units called\n\nvertebrae and is dorsally placed. It extends from\n\nthe base of the skull and constitutes the main\n\nframework of the trunk. Each vertebra has a\n\ncentral hollow portion (neural canal) through\n\nwhich the spinal cord passes. First vertebra is\n\nthe atlas and it articulates with the occipital\n\ncondyles. The vertebral column is differentiated\n\ninto cervical (7), thoracic (12), lumbar (5), sacral\n\n(1-fused) and coccygeal (1-fused) regions\n\nstarting from the skull. The number of cervical\n\nvertebrae are seven in almost all mammals\n\nincluding human beings. The vertebral column\n\nprotects the spinal cord, supports the head and\n\nserves as the point of attachment for the ribs\n\nand musculature of the back. Sternum is a\n\nflat bone on the ventral midline of thorax.\n\nThere are 12 pairs of ribs. Each rib is a\n\nthin flat bone connected dorsally to the\n\nvertebral column and ventrally to the sternum.\n\nIt has two articulation surfaces on its dorsal\n\nend and is hence called bicephalic. First seven\n\npairs of ribs are called true ribs. Dorsally, they\n\nare attached to the thoracic vertebrae and\n\nventrally connected to the sternum with the\n\nhelp of hyaline cartilage. The 8th, 9th and 10th\n\npairs of ribs do not articulate directly with the\n\nsternum but join the seventh rib with the help\n\nof hyaline cartilage. These are called\n\nvertebrochondral (false) ribs. Last 2 pairs (11th\n\nand 12th) of ribs are not connected ventrally\n\nand are therefore, called floating ribs. Thoracic\n\nvertebrae, ribs and sternum together form the\n\nrib cage (Figure 20.8).\n\nThe bones of the limbs alongwith their\n\ngirdles constitute the appendicular skeleton.\n\nEach limb is made of 30 bones. The bones of\n\nthe hand (fore limb) are humerus, radius and\n\nCervical vertebra\n\nIntervertebral\ndisc\n\nSacrum\n\nCoccyx\n\nThoracic\nvertebra\n\nLumbar\nvertebra\n\nFigure 20.7  Vertebral column (right lateral view)\n\nFigure 20.8  Ribs and rib cage\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nLOCOMOTION AND MOVEMENT 311\n\nFigure 20.9 Right pectoral girdle and upper\narm. (frontal view)\n\nulna, carpals (wrist bones – 8 in number),\n\nmetacarpals (palm bones – 5 in number) and\n\nphalanges (digits – 14 in number) (Figure\n\n20.9). Femur (thigh bone – the longest bone),\n\ntibia and fibula, tarsals (ankle bones – 7 in\n\nnumber), metatarsals (5 in number) and\n\nphalanges (digits – 14 in number) are the\n\nbones of the legs (hind limb) (Figure 20.10). A\n\ncup shaped bone called patella cover the knee\n\nventrally (knee cap).\n\nPectoral and Pelvic girdle bones help in\n\nthe articulation of the upper and the lower limbs\n\nrespectively with the axial skeleton. Each\n\ngirdle is formed of two halves. Each half of\n\npectoral girdle consists of a clavicle and a\n\nscapula (Figure 20.9). Scapula is a large\n\ntriangular flat bone situated in the dorsal part\n\nof the thorax between the second and the\n\nseventh ribs. The dorsal, flat, triangular body\n\nof scapula has a slightly elevated ridge called\n\nthe spine which projects as a flat, expanded\n\nprocess called the acromion. The clavicle\n\narticulates with this. Below the acromion is a\n\ndepression called the glenoid cavity which\n\narticulates with the head of the humerus to\n\nform the shoulder joint. Each clavicle is a long\n\nslender bone with two curvatures. This bone\n\nis commonly called the collar bone.\n\nPelvic girdle consists of two coxal bones\n\n(Figure 20.10). Each coxal bone is formed by\n\nthe fusion of three bones – ilium, ischium and\n\npubis. At the point of fusion of the above bones\n\nis a cavity called acetabulum to which the thigh\n\nbone articulates. The two halves of the pelvic\n\ngirdle meet ventrally to form the pubic\n\nsymphysis containing fibrous cartilage.\n\n20.4 JOINTS\n\nJoints are essential for all types of movements\n\ninvolving the bony parts of the body.\n\nLocomotory movements are no exception to\n\nFigure 20.10 Right pelvic girdle and lower limb\nbones (frontal view)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n312 BIOLOGY\n\nthis. Joints are points of contact between bones, or between bones and\n\ncartilages. Force generated by the muscles is used to carry out movement\n\nthrough joints, where the joint acts as a fulcrum. The movability at these\n\njoints vary depending on different factors. Joints have been classified into\n\nthree major structural forms, namely, fibrous, cartilaginous and synovial.\n\nFibrous joints do not allow any movement. This type of joint is shown\n\nby the flat skull bones which fuse end-to-end with the help of dense fibrous\n\nconnective tissues in the form of sutures, to form the cranium.\n\nIn cartilaginous joints, the bones involved are joined together with\n\nthe help of cartilages. The joint between the adjacent vertebrae in the\n\nvertebral column is of this pattern and it permits limited movements.\n\nSynovial joints are characterised by the presence of a fluid filled synovial\n\ncavity between the articulating surfaces of the two bones. Such an arragement\n\nallows considerable movement. These joints help in locomotion and many\n\nother movements. Ball and socket joint (between humerus and pectoral\n\ngirdle), hinge joint (knee joint), pivot joint (between atlas and axis), gliding\n\njoint (between the carpals) and saddle joint (between carpal and metacarpal\n\nof thumb) are some examples.\n\n20.5 DISORDERS OF MUSCULAR AND SKELETAL SYSTEM\n\nMyasthenia gravis: Auto immune disorder affecting neuromuscular\n\njunction leading to fatigue, weakening and paralysis of skeletal muscle.\n\nMuscular dystrophy: Progressive degeneration of skeletal muscle mostly\n\ndue to genetic disorder.\n\nTetany: Rapid spasms (wild contractions) in muscle due to low Ca++ in\n\nbody fluid.\n\nArthritis: Inflammation of joints.\n\nOsteoporosis: Age-related disorder characterised by decreased bone mass\n\nand increased chances of fractures. Decreased levels of estrogen is a\n\ncommon cause.\n\nGout: Inflammation of joints due to accumulation of uric acid crystals.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nMovement is an essential feature of all living beings. Protoplasmic streaming, ciliary\n\nmovements, movements of fins, limbs, wings, etc., are some forms exhibited by\n\nanimals. A voluntary movement which causes the animal to change its place, is\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nLOCOMOTION AND MOVEMENT 313\n\ncalled locomotion. Animals move generally in search of food, shelter, mate, breeding\n\nground, better climate or to protect themselves.\n\nThe cells of the human body exhibit amoeboid, ciliary and muscular\n\nmovements. Locomotion and many other movements require coordinated muscular\n\nactivities. Three types of muscles are present in our body. Skeletal muscles are\n\nattached to skeletal elements. They appear striated and are voluntary in nature.\n\nVisceral muscles, present in the inner walls of visceral organs are nonstriated and\n\ninvoluntary. Cardiac muscles are the muscles of the heart. They are striated,\n\nbranched and involuntary. Muscles possess excitability, contractility, extensibility\n\nand elasticity.\n\nMuscle fibre is the anatomical unit of muscle. Each muscle fibre has many\n\nparallelly arranged myofibrils. Each myofibril contains many serially arranged\n\nunits called sarcomere which are the functional units. Each sarcomere has a central\n\n‘A’ band made of thick myosin filaments, and two half ‘I’ bands made of thin actin\n\nfilaments on either side of it marked by ‘Z’  lines. Actin and myosin are polymerised\n\nproteins with contractility. The active sites for myosin on resting actin filament are\n\nmasked by a protein-troponin. Myosin head contains ATPase and has ATP binding\n\nsites and active sites for actin. A motor neuron carries signal to the muscle fibre\n\nwhich generates an action potential in it. This causes the release of Ca++ from\n\nsarcoplasmic reticulum. Ca++ activates actin which binds to the myosin head to\n\nform a cross bridge. These cross bridges pull the actin filaments causing them to\n\nslide over the myosin filaments and thereby causing contraction. Ca++ are then\n\nreturned to sarcoplasmic reticulum which inactivate the actin. Cross bridges are\n\nbroken and the muscles relax.\n\nRepeated stimulation of muscles leads to fatigue. Muscles are classified as\n\nRed and White fibres based primarily on the amount of red coloured myoglobin\n\npigment in them.\n\nBones and cartilages constitute our skeletal system. The skeletal system is\n\ndivisible into axial and appendicular. Skull, vertebral column, ribs and sternum\n\nconstitute the axial skeleton. Limb bones and girdles form the appendicular\n\nskeleton. Three types of joints are formed between bones or between bone and\n\ncartilage – fibrous, cartilaginous and synovial. Synovial joints allow considerable\n\nmovements and therefore, play a significant role in locomotion.\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1.

Coordination is the\n\nprocess through which two or more organs interact and complement the\n\nfunctions of one another. For example, when we do physical exercises,\n\nthe energy demand is increased for maintaining an increased muscular\n\nactivity. The supply of oxygen is also increased. The increased supply of\n\noxygen necessitates an increase in the rate of respiration, heart beat and\n\nincreased blood flow via blood vessels. When physical exercise is stopped,\n\nthe activities of nerves, lungs, heart and kidney gradually return to their\n\nnormal conditions. Thus, the functions of muscles, lungs, heart, blood\n\nvessels, kidney and other organs are coordinated while performing physical\n\nexercises. In our body the neural system and the endocrine system jointly\n\ncoordinate and integrate all the activities of the organs so that they function\n\nin a synchronised fashion.\n\nThe neural system provides an organised network of point-to-point\n\nconnections for a quick coordination. The endocrine system provides\n\nchemical integration through hormones. In this chapter, you will learn\n\nabout the neural system of human, mechanisms of neural coordination\n\nlike transmission of nerve impulse, impulse conduction across a synapse\n\nand the physiology of reflex action.\n\nNEURAL CONTROL AND\nCOORDINATION\n\nCHAPTER  21\n\n21.1 Neural System\n\n21.2 Human Neural\n\nSystem\n\n21.3 Neuron as\n\nStructural and\n\nFunctional Unit\n\nof Neural\n\nSystem\n\n21.4  Central Neural\n\nSystem\n\n21.5 Reflex Action\n\nand Reflex Arc\n\n21.6 Sensory\n\nReception and\n\nProcessing\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n316 BIOLOGY\n\n21.1 NEURAL SYSTEM\n\nThe neural system of all animals is composed of highly specialised cells called\n\nneurons which can detect, receive and transmit different kinds of stimuli.\n\nThe neural organisation is very simple in lower invertebrates. For\n\nexample, in Hydra it is composed of a network of neurons. The neural\n\nsystem is better organised in insects, where a brain is present along with\n\na number of ganglia and neural tissues. The vertebrates have a more\n\ndeveloped neural system.\n\n21.2 HUMAN NEURAL SYSTEM\n\nThe human neural system is divided into two parts :\n\n(i) the central neural system (CNS)\n\n(ii) the peripheral neural system (PNS)\n\nThe CNS includes the brain and the spinal cord and is the site of\n\ninformation processing and control. The PNS comprises of all the nerves\n\nof the body associated with the CNS (brain and spinal cord). The nerve\n\nfibres of the PNS are of two types :\n\n(a) afferent fibres\n\n(b) efferent fibres\n\nThe afferent nerve fibres transmit impulses from tissues/organs to\n\nthe CNS and the efferent fibres transmit regulatory impulses from the\n\nCNS to the concerned peripheral tissues/organs.\n\nThe PNS is divided into two divisions called somatic neural system\n\nand autonomic neural system. The somatic neural system relays\n\nimpulses from the CNS to skeletal muscles while the autonomic neural\n\nsystem transmits impulses from the CNS to the involuntary organs and\n\nsmooth muscles of the body. The autonomic neural system is further\n\nclassified into sympathetic neural system and parasympathetic neural\n\nsystem.\n\n       Visceral nervous system is the part of the peripheral nervous system\n\nthat comprises the whole complex of nerves, fibres, ganglia, and plexuses\n\nby which impulses travel from the central nervous system to the viscera\n\nand from the viscera to the central nervous system.\n\n21.3 NEURON AS STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL UNIT OF\nNEURAL SYSTEM\n\nA neuron is a microscopic structure composed of three major parts, namely,\n\ncell body, dendrites and axon (Figure 21.1). The cell body contains cytoplasm\n\nwith typical cell organelles and certain granular bodies called Nissl’s granules.\n\nShort fibres which branch repeatedly and project out of the cell body also\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nNEURAL CONTROL AND COORDINATION 317\n\ncontain Nissl’s granules and are called dendrites. These\n\nfibres transmit impulses towards the cell body.   The\n\naxon is a long fibre, the distal end of which is branched.\n\nEach branch terminates as a bulb-like structure called\n\nsynaptic knob which possess synaptic vesicles\n\ncontaining chemicals called neurotransmitters. The\n\naxons transmit nerve impulses away from the cell body\n\nto a synapse or to a neuro-muscular junction. Based\n\non the number of axon and dendrites, the neurons are\n\ndivided into three types, i.e., multipolar (with one axon\n\nand two or more dendrites; found in the cerebral cortex),\n\nbipolar (with one axon and one dendrite, found in the\n\nretina of eye) and unipolar (cell body with one axon\n\nonly; found usually in the embryonic stage). There are\n\ntwo types of axons, namely, myelinated and non-\n\nmyelinated. The myelinated nerve fibres are enveloped\n\nwith Schwann cells, which form a myelin sheath\n\naround the axon. The gaps between two adjacent\n\nmyelin sheaths are called nodes of Ranvier.\n\nMyelinated nerve fibres are found in spinal and cranial\n\nnerves. Unmyelinated nerve fibre is enclosed by a\n\nSchwann cell that does not form a myelin sheath\n\naround the axon, and is commonly found in\n\nautonomous and the somatic neural systems.\n\n21.3.1 Generation and Conduction of\nNerve Impulse\n\nNeurons are excitable cells because their membranes are in a polarised\n\nstate. Do you know why the membrane of a neuron is polarised? Different\n\ntypes of ion channels are present on the neural membrane. These ion\n\nchannels are selectively permeable to different ions. When a neuron is not\n\nconducting any impulse, i.e., resting, the axonal membrane is\n\ncomparatively more permeable to potassium ions (K\n+\n) and nearly\n\nimpermeable to sodium ions (Na+). Similarly, the membrane is\n\nimpermeable to negatively charged proteins present in the axoplasm.\n\nConsequently, the axoplasm inside the axon contains high concentration\n\nof K+ and negatively charged proteins and low concentration of Na+. In\n\ncontrast, the fluid outside the axon contains a low concentration of K+, a\n\nhigh concentration of Na+ and thus form a concentration gradient. These\n\nionic gradients across the resting membrane are maintained by the active\n\ntransport of ions by the sodium-potassium pump which transports 3\n\nNa\n+\n outwards for 2 K\n\n+\n into the cell. As a result, the outer surface of the\n\naxonal membrane possesses a positive charge while its inner surface\n\nFigure 21.1 Structure of a neuron\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n318 BIOLOGY\n\nbecomes negatively charged and therefore is polarised. The electrical\n\npotential difference across the resting plasma membrane is called as the\n\nresting potential.\n\nYou might be curious to know about the mechanisms of generation\n\nof nerve impulse and its conduction along an axon. When a stimulus is\n\napplied at a site (Figure 21.2 e.g., point A) on the polarised membrane,\n\nthe membrane at the site A becomes freely permeable to Na+. This leads\n\nto a rapid influx of Na+ followed by the reversal of the polarity at that site,\n\ni.e., the outer surface of the membrane becomes negatively charged and\n\nthe inner side becomes positively charged. The polarity of the membrane\n\nat the site A is thus reversed and hence depolarised. The electrical potential\n\ndifference across the plasma membrane at the site A is called the\n\naction potential, which is in fact termed as a nerve impulse. At sites\n\nimmediately ahead, the axon (e.g., site B) membrane has a positive charge\n\non the outer surface and a negative charge on its inner surface. As a\n\nresult, a current flows on the inner surface from site A to site B. On the\n\nouter surface current flows from site B to site A (Figure 21.2) to complete\n\nthe circuit of current flow. Hence, the polarity at the site is reversed, and\n\nan action potential is generated at site B.  Thus, the impulse (action\n\npotential) generated at site A arrives at site B. The sequence is repeated\n\nalong the length of the axon and consequently the impulse is conducted.\n\nThe rise in the stimulus-induced permeability to Na+ is extremely short-\n\nlived. It is quickly followed by a rise in permeability to K+. Within a fraction\n\nof a second, K+ diffuses outside the membrane and restores the resting\n\npotential of the membrane at the site of excitation and the fibre becomes\n\nonce more responsive to further stimulation.\n\n- -\n\n-\n\n- - - - - - - -\n\n-\n-\n\n-\n--\n\n----\n\n+\n\n+ +\n\n++\n\n+ + + + + +\n\n+\n+ + + + + + + + +\n\n+++\n\n- -\n\n- -\n\n-\n\n- - - - - - - -\n\n-\n-\n\n-\n--\n\n----\n\n+\n\n+ +\n\n++\n\n+ + + + + +\n\n+\n+ + + + + + + + +\n\n+++\n\n- -\n\nA\n\nNa\n\nB\n\nNa\n\nFigure 21.2 Diagrammatic representation of impulse conduction through an axon\n(at points A and B)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nNEURAL CONTROL AND COORDINATION 319\n\n21.3.2 Transmission of Impulses\n\nA nerve impulse is transmitted from one neuron to another through\n\njunctions called synapses. A synapse is formed by the membranes of a\n\npre-synaptic neuron and a post-synaptic neuron, which may or may not\n\nbe separated by a gap called synaptic cleft. There are two types of\n\nsynapses, namely, electrical synapses and chemical synapses. At electrical\n\nsynapses, the membranes of pre- and post-synaptic neurons are in very\n\nclose proximity. Electrical current can flow directly from one neuron into\n\nthe other across these synapses. Transmission of an impulse across\n\nelectrical synapses is very similar to impulse conduction along a single\n\naxon. Impulse transmission across an electrical synapse is always faster\n\nthan that across a chemical synapse. Electrical synapses are rare in our\n\nsystem.\n\nAt a chemical synapse, the membranes of the pre- and post-synaptic\n\nneurons are separated by a fluid-filled space called synaptic cleft\n\n(Figure 21.3). Do you know how the pre-synaptic neuron transmits an\n\nimpulse (action potential) across the synaptic cleft to the post-synaptic\n\nneuron? Chemicals called neurotransmitters are involved in the\n\ntransmission of impulses at these synapses. The axon terminals contain\n\nvesicles filled with these neurotransmitters. When an impulse (action\n\npotential) arrives at the axon terminal, it stimulates the movement of the\n\nsynaptic vesicles towards the membrane where they fuse with the plasma\n\nFigure 21.3 Diagram showing axon terminal and synapse\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n320 BIOLOGY\n\nmembrane and release their neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft. The\n\nreleased neurotransmitters bind to their specific receptors, present on\n\nthe post-synaptic membrane. This binding opens ion channels allowing\n\nthe entry of ions which can generate a new potential in the post-synaptic\n\nneuron. The new potential developed may be either excitatory or\n\ninhibitory.\n\n21.4 CENTRAL NEURAL SYSTEM\n\nThe brain is the central information processing organ of our body, and\n\nacts as the ‘command and control system’. It controls the voluntary\n\nmovements, balance of the body, functioning of vital involuntary organs\n\n(e.g., lungs, heart, kidneys, etc.), thermoregulation, hunger and thirst,\n\ncircadian (24-hour) rhythms of our body, activities of several endocrine\n\nglands and human behaviour.  It is also the site for processing of vision,\n\nhearing, speech, memory, intelligence, emotions and thoughts.\n\nThe human brain is well protected by the skull. Inside the skull, the\n\nbrain is covered by cranial meninges consisting of an outer layer called\n\ndura mater, a very thin middle layer called arachnoid and an inner layer\n\n(which is in contact with the brain tissue) called pia mater. The brain can\n\nbe divided into three major parts: (i) forebrain, (ii) midbrain, and\n\n(iii) hindbrain (Figure 21.4).\n\nFigure 21.4 Diagram showing sagital section of the human brain\n\nF\no\nr\ne\nb\n\nr\na\nin\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nNEURAL CONTROL AND COORDINATION 321\n\n21.4.1 Forebrain\n\nThe forebrain consists of cerebrum, thalamus and hypothalamus\n\n(Figure 21.4). Cerebrum forms the major part of the human brain. A deep\n\ncleft divides the cerebrum longitudinally into two halves, which are termed\n\nas the left and right cerebral hemispheres. The hemispheres are\n\nconnected by a tract of nerve fibres called corpus callosum. The layer of\n\ncells which covers the cerebral hemisphere is called cerebral cortex and is\n\nthrown into prominent folds. The cerebral cortex is referred to as the grey\n\nmatter due to its greyish appearance. The neuron cell bodies are\n\nconcentrated here giving the colour. The cerebral cortex contains motor\n\nareas, sensory areas and large regions that are neither clearly sensory\n\nnor motor in function. These regions called as the association areas are\n\nresponsible for complex functions like intersensory associations, memory\n\nand communication. Fibres of the tracts are covered with the myelin sheath,\n\nwhich constitute the inner part of cerebral hemisphere. They give an\n\nopaque white appearance to the layer and, hence, is called the white matter.\n\nThe cerebrum wraps around a structure called thalamus, which is a major\n\ncoordinating centre for sensory and motor signaling. Another very\n\nimportant part of the brain called hypothalamus lies at the base of the\n\nthalamus. The hypothalamus contains a number of centres which control\n\nbody temperature, urge for eating and drinking. It also contains several\n\ngroups of neurosecretory cells, which secrete hormones called\n\nhypothalamic hormones. The inner parts of cerebral hemispheres and a\n\ngroup of associated deep structures like amygdala, hippocampus, etc.,\n\nform a complex structure called the limbic lobe or limbic system. Along\n\nwith the hypothalamus, it is involved in the regulation of sexual behaviour,\n\nexpression of emotional reactions (e.g., excitement, pleasure, rage and\n\nfear), and motivation.\n\n21.4.2 Midbrain\n\nThe midbrain is located between the thalamus/hypothalamus of the\n\nforebrain and pons of the hindbrain. A canal called the cerebral aqueduct\n\npassess through the midbrain. The dorsal portion of the midbrain consists\n\nmainly of four round swellings (lobes) called corpora quadrigemina.\n\n21.4.3 Hindbrain\n\nThe hindbrain comprises pons, cerebellum and medulla (also called\nthe medulla oblongata). Pons consists of fibre tracts that interconnect\n\ndifferent regions of the brain. Cerebellum has very convoluted surface in\norder to provide the additional space for many more neurons. The medulla\nof the brain is connected to the spinal cord. The medulla contains centres\n\nwhich control respiration, cardiovascular reflexes and gastric secretions.\nThree major regions make up the brain stem; mid brain, pons\n\nand medulla oblongata. Brain stem forms the connections between\n\nthe brain and spinal cord.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n322 BIOLOGY\n\n21.5 REFLEX ACTION AND REFLEX ARC\n\nYou must have experienced a sudden withdrawal of a body part which\n\ncomes in contact with objects that are extremely hot, cold  pointed or\n\nanimals that are scary or poisonous. The entire process of response to a\n\nperipheral nervous stimulation, that occurs involuntarily, i.e., without\n\nconscious effort or thought and requires the involvment of a part of the\n\ncentral nervous system is called a reflex action. The reflex pathway\n\ncomprises at least one afferent neuron (receptor) and one efferent (effector\n\nor excitor) neuron appropriately arranged in a series (Figure 21.5). The\n\nafferent neuron receives signal from a sensory organ and transmits the\n\nimpulse via a dorsal nerve root into the CNS (at the level of spinal cord).\n\nThe efferent nueuron then carries signals from CNS to the effector. The\n\nstimulus and response thus forms a reflex arc as shown below in the\n\nknee jerk reflex. You should carefully study Figure 21.5 to understand\n\nthe mechanism of a knee jerk reflex.\n\n21.6 SENSORY RECEPTION AND PROCESSING\n\nHave you ever thought how do you feel the climatic changes in the\n\nenvironment? How do you see an object and its colour? How do you\n\nhear a sound? The sensory organs detect all types of changes in the\n\nenvironment and send appropriate signals to the CNS, where all the inputs\n\nare processed and analysed. Signals are then sent to different parts/\n\ncentres of the brain. This is how you can sense changes in the environment.\n\nFigure 21.5 Diagrammatic presentation of reflex action (showing knee jerk reflex)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nNEURAL CONTROL AND COORDINATION 323\n\nSense Organs\n\nWe smell things by our nose, taste by tongue, hear by ear and see objects\n\nby eyes.\n\nThe nose contains mucus-coated receptors which are specialised for\n\nreceiving the sense of smell and called olfactory receptors. These are\n\nmade up of olfactory epithelium that consists of three kinds of cells. The\n\nneurons of the olfactory epithelium extend from the outside environment\n\ndirectly into a pair of broad bean-sized organs, called olfactory bulb,\n\nwhich are extensions of the brain’s limbic system.\n\n Both nose and tongue detect dissolved chemicals. The chemical senses\n\nof gustation (taste) and olfactory (smell) are functionally similar and\n\ninterrelated. The tongue detects tastes through taste buds, containing\n\ngustatory receptors. With each taste of food or sip of drink, the brain\n\nintegrates the differential input from the taste buds and a complex flavour\n\nis perceived.\n\nIn the following sections, you will be introduced to the structure and\n\nfunctioning of the eye (sensory organ for vision) and the ear (sensory organ\n\nfor hearing).\n\n21.6.1 Eye\n\nOur paired eyes are located in sockets of the skull called orbits. A brief\n\naccount of structure and functions of the human eye is given in the\n\nfollowing sections.\n\n21.6.1.1 Parts of an eye\n\nThe adult human eye ball is\n\nnearly a spherical structure. The\n\nwall of the eye ball is composed\n\nof three layers (Figure 21.6). The\n\nexternal layer is composed of a\n\ndense connective tissue and is\n\ncalled the sclera. The anterior\n\nportion of this layer is called the\n\ncornea. The middle layer,\n\nchoroid, contains many blood\n\nvessels and looks bluish in\n\ncolour. The choroid layer is thin\n\nover the posterior two-thirds of\n\nthe eye ball, but it becomes thick\n\nin the anterior part to form the\n\nciliary body. The ciliary body Figure 21.6  Diagram showing parts of an eye\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n324 BIOLOGY\n\nitself continues forward to form a pigmented and opaque structure called\n\nthe iris which is the visible coloured portion of the eye. The eye ball contains\n\na transparent crystalline lens which is held in place by ligaments attached\n\nto the ciliary body. In front of the lens, the aperture surrounded by the\n\niris is called the pupil. The diameter of the pupil is regulated by the muscle\n\nfibres of iris.\n\nThe inner layer is the retina and it contains three layers of neural cells –\n\nfrom inside to outside – ganglion cells, bipolar cells and photoreceptor cells.\n\nThere are two types of photoreceptor cells, namely, rods and cones. These\n\ncells contain the light-sensitive proteins called the photopigments. The\n\ndaylight (photopic) vision and colour vision are functions of cones and\n\nthe twilight (scotopic) vision is the function of the rods. The rods contain\n\na purplish-red protein called the rhodopsin or visual purple, which\n\ncontains a derivative of Vitamin A. In the human eye, there are three types\n\nof cones which possess their own characteristic photopigments that\n\nrespond to red, green and blue lights. The sensations of different colours\n\nare produced by various combinations of these cones and their\n\nphotopigments. When these cones are stimulated equally, a sensation of\n\nwhite light is produced.\n\nThe optic nerves leave the eye and the retinal blood vessels enter it at\n\na point medial to and slightly above the posterior pole of the eye ball.\n\nPhotoreceptor cells are not present in that region and hence it is called\n\nthe blind spot. At the posterior pole of the eye lateral to the blind spot,\n\nthere is a yellowish pigmented spot called macula lutea with a central pit\n\ncalled the fovea. The fovea is a thinned-out portion of the retina where\n\nonly the cones are densely packed. It is the point where the visual acuity\n\n(resolution) is the greatest.\n\nThe space between the cornea and the lens is called the aqueous\n\nchamber and contains a thin watery fluid called aqueous humor. The\n\nspace between the lens and the retina is called the vitreous chamber\n\nand is filled with a transparent gel called vitreous humor.\n\n21.6.1.2 Mechanism of Vision\n\nThe light rays in visible wavelength focussed on the retina through the\n\ncornea and lens generate potentials (impulses) in rods and cones. As\n\nmentioned earlier, the photosensitive compounds (photopigments) in the\n\nhuman eyes is composed of opsin (a protein) and retinal (an aldehyde of\n\nvitamin A). Light induces dissociation of the retinal from opsin resulting\n\nin changes in the structure of the opsin. This causes membrane\n\npermeability changes. As a result, potential differences are generated in\n\nthe photoreceptor cells. This produces a signal that generates action\n\npotentials in the ganglion cells through the bipolar cells. These action\n\npotentials (impulses) are transmitted by the optic nerves to the visual\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nNEURAL CONTROL AND COORDINATION 325\n\nFigure 21.7 Diagrammatic view of ear\n\ncortex area of the brain, where the neural impulses are analysed and the\n\nimage formed on the retina is recognised  based on earlier memory and\n\nexperience.\n\n21.6.2 The Ear\n\nThe ears perform two sensory functions, hearing and maintenance of body\n\nbalance. Anatomically, the ear can be divided into three major sections\n\ncalled the outer ear, the middle ear and the inner ear (Figure 21.7). The\n\nouter ear consists of the\n\npinna and external\n\nauditory meatus (canal).\n\nThe pinna collects the\n\nvibrations in the air which\n\nproduce sound.  The\n\nexternal auditory meatus\n\nleads inwards and extends\n\nup to the tympanic\n\nmembrane (the ear drum).\n\nThere are very fine hairs and\n\nwax-secreting glands in the\n\nskin of the pinna and the\n\nmeatus. The tympanic\n\nmembrane is composed of\n\nconnective tissues covered\n\nwith skin outside and with\n\nmucus membrane inside.\n\nThe middle ear contains three ossicles called malleus, incus and stapes\n\nwhich are attached to one another in a chain-like fashion. The malleus is\n\nattached to the tympanic membrane and the stapes is attached to the\n\noval window of the cochlea. The ear ossicles increase the efficiency of\n\ntransmission of sound waves to the inner ear. An Eustachian tube\n\nconnects the middle ear cavity with the pharynx. The Eustachian tube\n\nhelps in equalising the pressures on either sides of the ear drum.\n\nThe fluid-filled inner ear called labyrinth consists of two parts, the\n\nbony and the membranous labyrinths. The bony labyrinth is a series of\n\nchannels. Inside these channels lies the membranous labyrinth, which is\n\nsurrounded by a fluid called perilymph. The membranous labyrinth is\n\nfilled with a fluid called endolymph. The coiled portion of the labyrinth is\n\ncalled cochlea. The membranes constituting cochlea, the reissner’s and\n\nbasilar, divide the surounding perilymph filled bony labyrinth into an\n\nupper scala vestibuli and a lower scala tympani (Figure 21.8). The space\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n326 BIOLOGY\n\nThe organ of corti is a structure located on the basilar membrane\n\nwhich contains hair cells that act as auditory receptors. The hair cells\n\nare present in rows on the internal side of the organ of corti. The basal\n\nend of the hair cell is in close contact with the afferent nerve fibres. A large\n\nnumber of processes called stereo cilia are projected from the apical part\n\nof each hair cell. Above the rows of the hair cells is a thin elastic membrane\n\ncalled tectorial membrane.\n\nThe inner ear also contains a complex system called vestibular\n\napparatus, located above the cochlea. The vestibular apparatus is\n\ncomposed of three semi-circular canals and the otolith (macula is the\n\nsensory part of saccule and utricle). Each semi-circular canal lies in a\n\ndifferent plane at right angles to each other. The membranous canals are\n\nsuspended in the perilymph of the bony canals. The base of canals is\n\nFigure 21.8  Diagrammatic representation of the sectional view of cochlea\n\nwithin cochlea called scala media is filled with endolymph. At the base of\n\nthe cochlea, the scala vestibuli ends at the oval window, while the scala\n\ntympani terminates at the round window which opens to the middle ear.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nNEURAL CONTROL AND COORDINATION 327\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe neural system coordinates and integrates functions as well as metabolic\n\nand homeostatic activities of all the organs. Neurons, the functional units of\n\nneural system are excitable cells due to a differential concentration gradient of\n\nions across the membrane. The electrical potential difference across the resting\n\nneural membrane is called the ‘resting potential’. The nerve impulse is conducted\n\nalong the axon membrane in the form of a wave of depolarisation and\n\nrepolarisation. A synapse is formed by the membranes of a pre-synaptic neuron\n\nand a post-synaptic neuron which may or may not be separated by a gap called\n\nsynaptic cleft. Chemicals involved in the transmission of impulses at chemical\n\nsynapses are called neurotransmitters.\n\nHuman neural system consists of two parts : (i) central neural system (CNS)\n\nand (ii) the peripheral neural system. The CNS consists of the brain and spiral\n\ncord. The brain can be divided into three major parts : (i) forebrain, (ii) midbrain\n\nand (iii) hindbrain. The forebrain consists of cerebrum, thalamus and\n\nhypothalamus. The cerebrum is longitudinally divided into two halves that are\n\nconnected by the corpus callosum. A very important part of the forebrain called\n\nhypothalamus controls the body temperature, eating and drinking. Inner parts\n\nswollen and is called ampulla, which contains a projecting ridge called\n\ncrista ampullaris which has hair cells. The saccule and utricle contain a\n\nprojecting ridge called macula. The crista and macula are the specific\n\nreceptors of the vestibular apparatus responsible for maintenance of\n\nbalance of the body and posture.\n\n20.6.2.1 Mechanism of Hearing\n\nHow does ear convert sound waves into neural impulses, which are\n\nsensed and processed by the brain enabling us to recognise a sound ?\n\nThe external ear receives sound waves and directs them to the ear drum.\n\nThe ear drum vibrates in response to the sound waves and these vibrations\n\nare transmitted through the ear ossicles (malleus, incus and stapes) to\n\nthe oval window. The vibrations are passed through the oval window on\n\nto the fluid of the cochlea, where they generate waves in the lymphs. The\n\nwaves in the lymphs induce a ripple in the basilar membrane. These\n\nmovements of the basilar membrane bend the hair cells, pressing them\n\nagainst the tectorial membrane. As a result, nerve impulses are generated\n\nin the associated afferent neurons. These impulses are transmitted by\n\nthe afferent fibres via auditory nerves to the auditory cortex of the brain,\n\nwhere the impulses are analysed and the sound is recognised.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n328 BIOLOGY\n\nof cerebral hemispheres and a group of associated deep structures form a\n\ncomplex structure called limbic system which is concerned with olfaction,\n\nautonomic responses, regulation of sexual behaviour, expression of emotional\n\nreactions, and motivation. The midbrain receives and integrates visual, tactile\n\nand auditory inputs. The hindbrain comprises pons, cerebellum and medulla.\n\nThe cerebellum integrates information received from the semicircular canals of\n\nthe ear and the auditory system. The medulla contains centres, which control\n\nrespiration, cardiovascular reflexes, and gastric secretions. Pons consist of fibre\n\ntracts that interconnect different regions of the brain. The entire process of\n\ninvoluntary response to a peripheral nervous stimulation is called reflex action.\n\nInformation regarding changes in the environment is received by the CNS\n\nthrough the sensory organs which are processed and analysed. Signals are then\n\nsent for necessary adjustments. The wall of the human eye ball is composed of\n\nthree layers. The external layer is composed of cornea and sclera. Inside sclera is\n\nthe middle layer, which is called the choroid. Retina, the innermost layer, contains\n\ntwo types of photoreceptor cells, namely rods and cones. The daylight (photopic)\n\nvision and colour vision are functions of cones and twilight (scotopic) vision is the\n\nfunction of the rods. The light enters through cornea, the lens and the images of\n\nobjects are formed on the retina.\n\nThe ear can be divided into the outer ear, the middle ear and the inner ear. The\n\nmiddle ear contains three ossicles called malleus, incus and stapes. The fluid\n\nfilled inner ear is called the labyrinth, and the coiled portion of the labyrinth is\n\ncalled cochlea. The organ of corti is a structure which contains hair cells that act\n\nas auditory receptors and is located on the basilar membrane. The vibrations\n\nproduced in the ear drum are transmitted through the ear ossicles and oval window\n\nto the fluid-filled inner ear. Nerve impulses are generated and transmitted by the\n\nafferent fibres to the auditory cortex of the brain. The inner ear also contains a\n\ncomplex system located above the cochlea called vestibular apparatus. It is\n\ninfluenced by gravity and movements, and helps us in maintaining balance of the\n\nbody and posture.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nNEURAL CONTROL AND COORDINATION 329\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1.

The neural\n\ncoordination is fast but short-lived. As the nerve fibres do not innervate\n\nall cells of the body and the cellular functions need to be continuously\n\nregulated; a special kind of coordination and integration has to be\n\nprovided. This function is carried out by hormones. The neural system\n\nand the endocrine system jointly coordinate and regulate the\n\nphysiological functions in the body.\n\n22.1 ENDOCRINE GLANDS AND HORMONES\n\nEndocrine glands lack ducts and are hence, called ductless glands. Their\n\nsecretions are called hormones. The classical definition of hormone as a\n\nchemical produced by endocrine glands and released into the blood and\n\ntransported to a distantly located target organ has current scientific\n\ndefinition as follows: Hormones are non-nutrient chemicals which\n\nact as intercellular messengers and are produced in trace amounts.\n\nThe new definition covers a number of new molecules in addition to the\n\nhormones secreted by the organised endocrine glands. Invertebrates\n\npossess very simple endocrine systems with few hormones whereas a large\n\nnumber of chemicals act as hormones and provide coordination in the\n\nvertebrates. The human endocrine system is described here.\n\nCHEMICAL COORDINATION\nAND INTEGRATION\n\nCHAPTER  22\n\n22.1 Endocrine\n\nGlands and\n\nHormones\n\n22.2 Human\n\nEndocrine\n\nSystem\n\n22.3 Hormones of\n\nHeart, Kidney\n\nand\n\nGastrointestinal\n\nTract\n\n22.4 Mechanism of\n\nHormone Action\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nBIOLOGY332\n\n22.2   HUMAN ENDOCRINE SYSTEM\n\nThe endocrine glands and hormone\n\nproducing diffused tissues/cells located\n\nin different parts of our body constitute\n\nthe endocrine system. Pituitary, pineal,\n\nthyroid, adrenal, pancreas, parathyroid,\n\nthymus and gonads (testis in males and\n\novary in females) are the organised\n\nendocrine bodies in our body\n\n(Figure 22.1). In addition to these, some\n\nother organs, e.g., gastrointestinal tract,\n\nliver, kidney, heart also produce\n\nhormones. A brief account of the\n\nstructure and functions of all major\n\nendocrine glands  and hypothalamus\n\nof the human body is given in the\n\nfollowing sections.\n\n22.2.1 The Hypothalamus\n\nAs you know, the hypothalamus is the\n\nbasal part of diencephalon, forebrain\n\n(Figure 22.1) and it regulates a wide\n\nspectrum of body functions. It contains\n\nseveral groups of neurosecretory cells\n\ncalled nuclei which produce hormones.\n\nThese hormones regulate the synthesis and secretion of pituitary\n\nhormones. However, the hormones produced by hypothalamus are of\n\ntwo types, the releasing hormones (which stimulate secretion of pituitary\n\nhormones) and the inhibiting hormones (which inhibit secretions of\n\npituitary hormones). For example a hypothalamic hormone called\n\nGonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulates the pituitary\n\nsynthesis and release of gonadotrophins. On the other hand, somatostatin\n\nfrom the hypothalamus inhibits the release of growth hormone from the\n\npituitary. These hormones originating in the hypothalamic neurons, pass\n\nthrough axons and are released from their nerve endings. These hormones\n\nreach the pituitary gland through a portal circulatory system and regulate\n\nthe functions of the anterior pituitary. The posterior pituitary is under\n\nthe direct neural regulation of the hypothalamus (Figure 22.2).\n\nFigure 22.1 Location of endocrine glands\n\nTestis\n(in male)\n\nOvary\n(in female)\n\nAdrenal\n\nPancreas\n\nThyroid and\nParathyroid\n\nThymus\n\nPineal\n\nPituitary\n\nHypothalamus\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n333333CHEMICAL COORDINATION AND INTEGRATION\n\n22.2.2 The Pituitary Gland\n\nThe pituitary gland is located in a bony cavity\n\ncalled sella tursica and is attached to\n\nhypothalamus by a stalk (Figure 22.2). It is\n\ndivided anatomically into an adenohypophysis\n\nand a neurohypophysis. Adenohypophysis\n\nconsists of two portions, pars distalis and pars\n\nintermedia. The pars distalis region of pituitary,\n\ncommonly called anterior pituitary, produces\n\ngrowth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), thyroid\n\nstimulating hormone (TSH),\n\nadrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH),\n\nluteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle\n\nstimulating hormone (FSH). Pars intermedia\n\nsecretes only one hormone called melanocyte\n\nstimulating hormone (MSH). However, in\n\nhumans, the pars intermedia is almost merged\n\nwith pars distalis. Neurohypophysis (pars\n\nnervosa) also known as posterior pituitary, stores\n\nand releases two hormones called oxytocin and\n\nvasopressin, which are actually synthesised by\n\nthe hypothalamus and are transported axonally to neurohypophysis.\n\nOver-secretion of GH stimulates abnormal growth of the body leading\n\nto gigantism and low secretion of GH results in stunted growth resulting\n\nin pituitary dwarfism. Excess secretion of growth hormone in adults\n\nespecially in middle age can result in severe disfigurement (especially of\n\nthe face) called Acromegaly, which may lead to serious complications,\n\nand premature death if unchecked. The disease is hard to diagnose in\n\nthe early stages and often goes undetected for many years, until changes\n\nin external features become noticeable. Prolactin regulates the growth of\n\nthe mammary glands and formation of milk in them. TSH stimulates the\n\nsynthesis and secretion of thyroid hormones from the thyroid gland. ACTH\n\nstimulates the synthesis and secretion of steroid hormones called\n\nglucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex. LH and FSH stimulate gonadal\n\nactivity and hence are called gonadotrophins. In males, LH stimulates\n\nthe synthesis and secretion of hormones called androgens from testis. In\n\nmales, FSH and androgens regulate spermatogenesis. In females, LH\n\ninduces ovulation of fully mature follicles (graafian follicles) and maintains\n\nthe corpus luteum, formed from the remnants of the graafian follicles\n\nPosterior\npituitary\n\nAnterior\npituitary\n\nHypothalamus\n\nHypothalamic\nneurons\n\nPortal circulation\n\nFigure 22.2 Diagrammatic representation of\npituitary and its relationship with\nhypothalamus\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nBIOLOGY334\n\nafter ovulation. FSH stimulates growth and\n\ndevelopment of the ovarian follicles in females. MSH\n\nacts on the melanocytes (melanin containing cells) and\n\nregulates pigmentation of the skin. Oxytocin acts on\n\nthe smooth muscles of our body and stimulates their\n\ncontraction. In females, it stimulates a vigorous\ncontraction of uterus at the time of child birth, and milk\nejection from the mammary gland. Vasopressin acts\nmainly at the kidney and stimulates resorption of water\nand electrolytes by the distal tubules and thereby\nreduces loss of water through urine (diuresis). Hence,\nit is also called as anti-diuretic hormone (ADH).\n\nAn impairment affecting synthesis or release of ADH\n\nresults in a diminished ability of the kidney to conserve\n\nwater leading to water loss and dehydration. This\n\ncondition is known as Diabetes Insipidus.\n\n22.2.3 The Pineal Gland\n\nThe pineal gland is located on the dorsal side of\n\nforebrain. Pineal secretes a hormone called melatonin.\n\nMelatonin plays a very important role in the regulation\n\nof a 24-hour (diurnal) rhythm of our body. For\n\nexample, it helps in maintaining the normal rhythms\n\nof sleep-wake cycle, body temperature. In addition,\n\nmelatonin also influences metabolism, pigmentation,\n\nthe menstrual cycle as well as our defense capability.\n\n22.2.4 Thyroid Gland\n\nThe thyroid gland is composed of two lobes which are\n\nlocated on either side of the trachea (Figure 22.3). Both\n\nthe lobes are interconnected with a thin flap of connective\n\ntissue called isthmus. The thyroid gland is composed of\n\nfollicles and stromal tissues. Each thyroid follicle is\n\ncomposed of follicular cells, enclosing a cavity. These\n\nfollicular cells synthesise two hormones,\n\ntetraiodothyronine or thyroxine (T\n4\n) and\n\ntriiodothyronine (T\n3\n). Iodine is essential for the normal\n\nrate of hormone synthesis in the thyroid. Deficiency of\n\niodine in our diet results in hypothyroidism and\n\nenlargement of the thyroid gland, commonly called\n\ngoitre. Hypothyroidism during pregnancy causes\n\ndefective development and maturation of the growing\n\nFigure 22.3 Diagrammatic view of the\nposition of Thyroid and\nParathyroid\n(a) Ventral side\n(b) Dorsal side\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n335335CHEMICAL COORDINATION AND INTEGRATION\n\nbaby leading to stunted growth (cretinism), mental retardation, low\n\nintelligence quotient, abnormal skin, deaf-mutism, etc. In adult women,\n\nhypothyroidism may cause menstrual cycle to become irregular. Due to\n\ncancer of the thyroid gland or due to development of nodules of the thyroid\n\nglands, the rate of synthesis and secretion of the thyroid hormones is\n\nincreased to abnormal high levels leading to a condition called\n\nhyperthyroidism which adversely affects the body physiology.\n\nExopthalmic goitre is a form of hyperthyroidism, characterised by\n\nenlargement of the thyroid gland, protrusion of the eyeballs, increased\n\nbasal metabolic rate, and weight loss, also called Graves’ disease.\n\nThyroid hormones play an important role in the regulation of the basal\n\nmetabolic rate. These hormones also support the process of red blood cell\n\nformation. Thyroid hormones control the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins\n\nand fats. Maintenance of water and electrolyte balance is also influenced by\n\nthyroid hormones. Thyroid gland also secretes a protein hormone called\n\nthyrocalcitonin (TCT) which regulates the blood calcium levels.\n\n22.2.5 Parathyroid Gland\n\nIn humans, four parathyroid glands are present on the back side of the\n\nthyroid gland, one pair each in the two lobes of the thyroid gland (Figure\n\n22.3b). The parathyroid glands secrete a peptide hormone called\n\nparathyroid hormone (PTH). The secretion of PTH is regulated by the\n\ncirculating levels of calcium ions.\n\nParathyroid hormone (PTH) increases the Ca2+ levels in the blood. PTH\n\nacts on bones and stimulates the process of bone resorption (dissolution/\n\ndemineralisation). PTH also stimulates reabsorption of Ca2+ by the renal\n\ntubules and increases Ca2+ absorption from the digested food. It is, thus,\n\nclear that PTH is a hypercalcemic hormone, i.e., it increases the blood\n\nCa2+ levels. Along with TCT, it plays a significant role in calcium balance\n\nin the body.\n\n22.2.6 Thymus\n\nThe thymus gland is a lobular structure located between lungs behind\n\nsternum on the ventral side of aorta. The thymus plays a major role in\n\nthe development of the immune system. This gland secretes the peptide\n\nhormones called thymosins. Thymosins play a major role in the\n\ndifferentiation of T-lymphocytes, which provide cell-mediated\n\nimmunity. In addition, thymosins also promote production of antibodies\n\nto provide humoral immunity. Thymus is degenerated in old individuals\n\nresulting in a decreased production of thymosins. As a result, the immune\n\nresponses of old persons become weak.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nBIOLOGY336\n\nThe adrenal medulla secretes two hormones called adrenaline or\n\nepinephrine and noradrenaline or norepinephrine. These are\n\ncommonly called as catecholamines. Adrenaline and noradrenaline are\n\nrapidly secreted in response to stress of any kind and during emergency\n\nsituations and are called emergency hormones or hormones of Fight\n\nor Flight. These hormones increase alertness, pupilary dilation,\n\npiloerection (raising of hairs), sweating etc. Both the hormones increase\n\nthe heart beat, the strength of heart contraction and the rate of respiration.\n\nCatecholamines also stimulate the breakdown of glycogen resulting in\n\n22.2.7 Adrenal Gland\n\nOur body has one pair of adrenal glands, one at the anterior part of each\n\nkidney (Figure 22.4 a). The gland is composed of two types of tissues.\n\nThe centrally located tissue is called the adrenal medulla, and outside\n\nthis lies the adrenal cortex (Figure 22.4 b).\n\nUnderproduction of hormones by the adrenal cortex alters\n\ncarbohydrate metabolism causing acute weakness and fatigue leading\n\nto a disease called Addison’s disease.\n\nFigure 22.4  Diagrammatic representation of : (a) Adrenal gland above kidney\n\n(b) Section showing two parts of adrenal gland\n\nAdrenal gland\nAdrenal cortex\n\nKidney\n\nAdrenal medulla\n\n(a) (b)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n337337CHEMICAL COORDINATION AND INTEGRATION\n\nan increased concentration of glucose in blood. In addition, they also\n\nstimulate the breakdown of lipids and proteins.\n\nThe adrenal cortex can be divided into three layers, called zona\n\nreticularis (inner layer), zona fasciculata (middle layer) and zona\n\nglomerulosa (outer layer). The adrenal cortex secretes many hormones,\n\ncommonly called as corticoids. The corticoids, which are involved in\n\ncarbohydrate metabolism are called glucocorticoids. In our body, cortisol\n\nis the main glucocorticoid. Corticoids, which regulate the balance of water\n\nand electrolytes in our body are called mineralocorticoids. Aldosterone is\n\nthe main mineralocorticoid in our body.\n\nGlucocorticoids stimulate gluconeogenesis, lipolysis and proteolysis;\n\nand inhibit cellular uptake and utilisation of amino acids. Cortisol is also\n\ninvolved in maintaining the cardio-vascular system as well as the kidney\n\nfunctions. Glucocorticoids, particularly cortisol, produces anti-\n\ninflammatory reactions and suppresses the immune response. Cortisol\n\nstimulates the RBC production. Aldosterone acts mainly at the renal\n\ntubules and stimulates the reabsorption of Na+ and water and excretion\n\nof K+ and phosphate ions. Thus, aldosterone helps in the maintenance of\n\nelectrolytes, body fluid volume, osmotic pressure and blood pressure.\n\nSmall amounts of androgenic steroids are also secreted by the adrenal\n\ncortex which play a role in the growth of axial hair, pubic hair and facial\n\nhair during puberty.\n\n22.2.8 Pancreas\n\nPancreas is a composite gland (Figure 22.1) which acts as both exocrine\n\nand endocrine gland. The endocrine pancreas consists of ‘Islets of\n\nLangerhans’. There are about 1 to 2 million Islets of Langerhans in a\n\nnormal human pancreas representing only 1 to 2 per cent of the pancreatic\n\ntissue. The two main types of cells in the Islet of Langerhans are called\n\nααααα-cells and βββββ-cells. The α-cells secrete a hormone called glucagon, while\n\nthe βββββ-cells secrete insulin.\n\nGlucagon is a peptide hormone, and plays an important role in\n\nmaintaining the normal blood glucose levels. Glucagon acts mainly on\n\nthe liver cells (hepatocytes) and stimulates glycogenolysis resulting in an\n\nincreased blood sugar (hyperglycemia). In addition, this hormone\n\nstimulates the process of gluconeogenesis which also contributes to\n\nhyperglycemia. Glucagon reduces the cellular glucose uptake and\n\nutilisation. Thus, glucagon is a hyperglycemic hormone.\n\nInsulin is a peptide hormone, which plays a major role in the\n\nregulation of glucose homeostasis. Insulin acts mainly on hepatocytes\n\nand adipocytes (cells of adipose tissue), and enhances cellular glucose\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nBIOLOGY338\n\nuptake and utilisation. As a result, there is a rapid movement of glucose\n\nfrom blood to hepatocytes and adipocytes resulting in decreased blood\n\nglucose levels (hypoglycemia). Insulin also stimulates conversion of\n\nglucose to glycogen (glycogenesis) in the target cells. The glucose\n\nhomeostasis in blood is thus maintained jointly by the two – insulin and\n\nglucagons.\n\nProlonged hyperglycemia leads to a complex disorder called diabetes\n\nmellitus which is associated with loss of glucose through urine and\n\nformation of harmful compounds known as ketone bodies. Diabetic\n\npatients are successfully treated with insulin therapy.\n\n22.2.9 Testis\n\nA pair of testis is present in the scrotal sac (outside abdomen) of male\n\nindividuals (Figure 22.1). Testis performs dual functions as a primary\n\nsex organ as well as an endocrine gland. Testis is composed of\n\nseminiferous tubules and stromal or interstitial tissue. The Leydig\n\ncells or interstitial cells, which are present in the intertubular\n\nspaces produce a group of hormones called androgens mainly\n\ntestosterone.\n\nAndrogens regulate the development, maturation and functions of\n\nthe male accessory sex organs like epididymis, vas deferens, seminal\n\nvesicles, prostate gland, urethra etc. These hormones stimulate muscular\n\ngrowth, growth of facial and axillary hair, aggressiveness, low pitch of\n\nvoice etc. Androgens play a major stimulatory role in the process of\n\nspermatogenesis (formation of spermatozoa). Androgens act on the central\n\nneural system and influence the male sexual behaviour (libido). These\n\nhormones produce anabolic (synthetic) effects on protein and carbohydrate\n\nmetabolism.\n\n22.2.10 Ovary\n\nFemales have a pair of ovaries located in the abdomen (Figure 22.1). Ovary\n\nis the primary female sex organ which produces one ovum during each\n\nmenstrual cycle. In addition, ovary also produces two groups of steroid\n\nhormones called estrogen and progesterone. Ovary is composed of\n\novarian follicles and stromal tissues. The estrogen is synthesised and\n\nsecreted mainly by the growing ovarian follicles. After ovulation, the\n\nruptured follicle is converted to a structure called corpus luteum, which\n\nsecretes mainly progesterone.\n\nEstrogens produce wide ranging actions such as stimulation of growth\n\nand activities of female secondary sex organs, development of growing\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n339339CHEMICAL COORDINATION AND INTEGRATION\n\novarian follicles, appearance of female secondary sex characters (e.g., high\n\npitch of voice, etc.), mammary gland development. Estrogens also regulate\n\nfemale sexual behaviour.\n\nProgesterone supports pregnancy. Progesterone also acts on the\n\nmammary glands and stimulates the formation of alveoli (sac-like\n\nstructures which store milk) and milk secretion.\n\n22.3 HORMONES OF HEART, KIDNEY AND GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT\n\nNow you know about the endocrine glands and their hormones. However,\n\nas mentioned earlier, hormones are also secreted by some tissues which\n\nare not endocrine glands. For example, the atrial wall of our heart secretes\n\na very important peptide hormone called atrial natriuretic factor (ANF),\n\nwhich decreases blood pressure. When blood pressure is increased, ANF\n\nis secreted which causes dilation of the blood vessels. This reduces the\n\nblood pressure.\n\nThe juxtaglomerular cells of kidney produce a peptide hormone called\n\nerythropoietin which stimulates erythropoiesis (formation of RBC).\n\nEndocrine cells present in different parts of the gastro-intestinal tract\n\nsecrete four major peptide hormones, namely gastrin, secretin,\n\ncholecystokinin (CCK) and gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP). Gastrin\n\nacts on the gastric glands and stimulates the secretion of hydrochloric\n\nacid and pepsinogen. Secretin acts on the exocrine pancreas and\n\nstimulates secretion of water and bicarbonate ions. CCK acts on both\n\npancreas and gall bladder and stimulates the secretion of pancreatic\n\nenzymes and bile juice, respectively. GIP inhibits gastric secretion and\n\nmotility. Several other non-endocrine tissues secrete hormones called\n\ngrowth factors. These factors are essential for the normal growth of tissues\n\nand their repairing/regeneration.\n\n22.4 MECHANISM OF HORMONE ACTION\n\nHormones produce their effects on target tissues by binding to specific\n\nproteins called hormone receptors located in the target tissues only.\n\nHormone receptors present on the cell membrane of the target cells are\n\ncalled membrane-bound receptors and the receptors present inside the\n\ntarget cell are called intracellular receptors, mostly nuclear receptors\n\n(present in the nucleus). Binding of a hormone to its receptor leads to the\n\nformation of a hormone-receptor complex (Figure 22.5 a, b). Each\n\nreceptor is specific to one hormone only and hence receptors are specific.\n\nHormone-Receptor complex formation leads to certain biochemical\n\nchanges in the target tissue. Target tissue metabolism and hence\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nBIOLOGY340\n\nphysiological functions are regulated by hormones. On the basis of their\n\nchemical nature, hormones can be divided into groups :\n\n(i) peptide, polypeptide, protein hormones (e.g., insulin, glucagon,\n\npituitary hormones, hypothalamic hormones, etc.)\n\n(ii) steroids (e.g., cortisol, testosterone, estradiol and progesterone)\n\n(iii) iodothyronines (thyroid hormones)\n\n(iv) amino-acid derivatives (e.g., epinephrine).\n\nHormones  which interact with membrane-bound receptors normally\n\ndo not enter the target cell, but generate second messengers (e.g., cyclic\n\nAMP, IP\n3\n, Ca++ etc) which in turn regulate cellular metabolism (Figure\n\n22.5a). Hormones which interact with intracellular receptors (e.g., steroid\n\nhormones, iodothyronines, etc.) mostly regulate gene expression or\n\nchromosome function by the interaction of hormone-receptor complex\n\nwith the genome. Cumulative biochemical actions result in physiological\n\nand developmental effects (Figure 22.5b).\n\n(a)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n341341CHEMICAL COORDINATION AND INTEGRATION\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThere are special chemicals which act as hormones and provide chemical\n\ncoordination, integration and regulation in the human body. These hormones\n\nregulate metabolism, growth and development of our organs, the endocrine glands\n\nor certain cells. The endocrine system is composed of hypothalamus, pituitary\n\nand pineal, thyroid, adrenal, pancreas, parathyroid, thymus and gonads (testis\n\nand ovary). In addition to these, some other organs, e.g., gastrointestinal tract,\n\nkidney, heart etc., also produce hormones. The pituitary gland is divided into\n\nthree major parts, which are called as  pars distalis, pars intermedia and pars\n\nnervosa. Pars distalis produces six trophic hormones. Pars intermedia secretes\n\nFigure 22.5 Diagramatic representation of the mechanism of hormone action :\n(a) Protein hormone  (b) Steroid hormone\n\n(b)\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\nBIOLOGY342\n\nonly one hormone, while pars nervosa (neurohypophysis) secretes two hormones.\n\nThe pituitary hormones regulate the growth and development of somatic tissues\n\nand activities of peripheral endocrine glands. Pineal gland secretes melatonin, which\n\nplays a very important role in the regulation of 24-hour (diurnal) rhythms of our\n\nbody (e.g., rhythms of sleep and state of being awake, body temperature, etc.). The\n\nthyroid gland hormones play an important role in the regulation of the basal\n\nmetabolic rate, development and maturation of the central neural system,\n\nerythropoiesis, metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins and fats, menstrual cycle.\n\nAnother thyroid hormone, i.e., thyrocalcitonin regulates calcium levels in our blood\n\nby decreasing it. The parathyroid glands secrete parathyroid hormone (PTH) which\n\nincreases the blood Ca2+ levels and plays a major role in calcium homeostasis. The\n\nthymus gland secretes thymosins which play a major role in the differentiation of\n\nT-lymphocytes, which provide cell-mediated immunity. In addition, thymosins\n\nalso increase the production of antibodies to provide humoral immunity. The\n\nadrenal gland is composed of the centrally located adrenal medulla and the outer\n\nadrenal cortex. The adrenal medulla secretes epinephrine and norepinephrine.\n\nThese hormones increase alertness, pupilary dilation, piloerection, sweating, heart\n\nbeat, strength of heart contraction, rate of respiration, glycogenolysis, lipolysis,\n\nproteolysis. The adrenal cortex secretes glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids.\n\nGlucocorticoids stimulate gluconeogenesis, lipolysis, proteolysis, erythropoiesis,\n\ncardio-vascular system, blood pressure, and glomerular filtration rate and inhibit\n\ninflammatory reactions by suppressing the immune response. Mineralocorticoids\n\nregulate water and electrolyte contents of the body. The endocrine pancreas secretes\n\nglucagon and insulin. Glucagon stimulates glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis\n\nresulting in hyperglycemia. Insulin stimulates cellular glucose uptake and\n\nutilisation, and glycogenesis resulting in hypoglycemia. Insulin deficiency\n\nand/or insulin resistance result in a disease called diabetes mellitus.\n\nThe testis secretes androgens, which stimulate the development, maturation\n\nand functions of the male accessory sex organs, appearance of the male secondary\n\nsex characters, spermatogenesis, male sexual behaviour, anabolic pathways and\n\nerythropoiesis. The ovary secretes estrogen and progesterone. Estrogen stimulates\n\ngrowth and development of female accessory sex organs and secondary sex\n\ncharacters. Progesterone plays a major role in the maintenance of pregnancy as\n\nwell as in mammary gland development and lactation. The atrial wall of the heart\n\nproduces atrial natriuretic factor which decreases the blood pressure. Kidney\n\nproduces erythropoietin which stimulates erythropoiesis. The gastrointestinal tract\n\nsecretes gastrin, secretin, cholecystokinin and gastric inhibitory peptide. These\n\nhormones regulate the secretion of digestive juices and help in digestion.\n\n2022-23\n\n\n\n343343CHEMICAL COORDINATION AND INTEGRATION\n\nEXERCISES\n\n1.
